Thank you for standing by. My name is Denise and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Tuesday, November 6, 2012. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron Hinson - Director, Financial Planning and Investor Relations","Thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2012.","Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity, including an update on our base rate case for our electric business. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project, including the recently approved annual rate increase from the Base Load Review Act or BLRA, our current new nuclear hearing as well as the current refueling outage of V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. After those comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on slide two. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we will disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the slides used in conjunction with this call.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Byron. I would like to start by saying to all of you in the path of Sandy that you are in our thoughts and prayers. And continuing with our tradition of providing resources through our mutual assistance arrangements coordinated through the Southeastern Electric Exchange, we have already sent both utility, construction, and three crews to the affected areas. And we are prepared to send additional resources as directed as part of this coordinated effort to assist those in need.","I will begin our earnings discussion on slide three. Basics earnings per share were $0.93 for the third quarter of 2012 versus $0.81 in 2011. Electric margins were higher due to customer growth and base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. These margins were partially offset by the cost of our capital program depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution. Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses were slightly lower during the third quarter of 2012 than in the same period of 2011. We still forecast operating and maintenance expenses to be slightly higher for the full year compared to 2011. We also expect a modest trend to continue into 2013 as we continue to see increases in the costs to operate our systems safely and reliably.","Please turn to slide four. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 were $2.41 versus $2.25 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.","And now on slide five, I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company\u2019s 2012 third quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue were $1.1, an increase of $0.09 over the third quarter of 2011. Electric and gas margins were higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Rate Stabilization Act coupled with customer growth. This increase in margin was offset by higher interest expense, depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher about $0.20 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.","PSNC Energy shown in red reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, consistent with 2011. Increases in margin due to customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and interest expense. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, again consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy in green reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter of 2012, also consistent with 2011. Year-to-date earnings were down approximately $0.09 due to the impact of mild weather in the first quarter.","Our corporate and other businesses reported a loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.05 per share in 2011. For the nine month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.03 compared to a loss of $0.02 in the same period in the prior year. The results for 2011 reflect a slightly higher quarterly effective income tax rate at the holding company, while 2012 results also reflect revenue growth at our interstate pipeline business due to lower natural gas cost.","Next, I would like to touch on economic trends in our service area as shown on slide six. We continued to be encouraged by the level of economic development in our territories with approximately $1 billion invested in the Carolinas this year. Housing is also encouraging. While we still have not returned to pre-recession levels, we are seeing improvement in each of the areas we serve as you see in the chart at the bottom left. Additionally, SCE&G\u2019s territory, which is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia metro areas has not been as volatile as the rest of the Southeast. In the bottom right you can find our current \u2013 customer growth percentages. We continued to be encouraged by the growth in our customer base. Customer growth has slowed slightly in our electric business during the quarter as it\u2019s typical. We tend to see slower electric customer growth during the third and fourth quarters of the year.","For the 12-month period ended September 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 1% and 0.4% respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 2.6% primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire as we have discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back on line earlier this month. Where the customer\u2019s operation is consistent with 2011, we estimate overall industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%. In addition the Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic with customer volume up 12% this quarter over the prior year. As I mentioned before it is estimated that one in every five jobs in South Carolina is related to Port volume.","Please turn now to slide seven, which sets forth our regulated rate base returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on the slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings. The pie chart on the upper left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.5 billion as of June 30. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with approximately $6.4 billion and total electric investment as denoted in two shades of blue.","As Steve will discuss the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved the fifth consecutive rate increase under the Base Load Review Act. The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period, not much has changed here. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker. The return on our regulated gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. However, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently issued an order or a rate increase of $7.5 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act. This increase should bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.","As you are aware in June of 2012, we filed an application for rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss to a greater extent on the next slide. That application reflected a return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed. The bottom of the slide includes the timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012 outside of the new nuclear project. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed all, but one of our planned regulatory filings. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost at SCE&G.","Please turn now to slide eight. On June 29, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. We filed our testimony on October 2 in the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners filed their testimony last Friday. We are constructively engaged with ORS and the other interveners in hopes of reaching a settlement by hearing a schedule for November 27 and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission in late December as new rates are effective January 2013.","Slide nine presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report from August, which includes amounts as of the second quarter of 2012. We will update these amounts with our next quarterly filing in mid-November to include changes in AFC, escalation and construction activities. Otherwise, this slide is identical to the CapEx forecast we shared during our second quarter earnings call. Also, as you can see along the bottom of the slide and due to your request, we have included our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30 of each year. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increases are calculated. As you will note, the amounts are nearly the same as the calendar period CWIP that we have previously provided.","Please turn to slide 10 to review our financing plan, which is consistent with our last earnings call. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012 and our estimated financing plan through 2017 remains unchanged. We continued to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares.","As presented on slide 11, we are tightening our guidance for the year to $3.10 to $3.25 in basic earnings per share. We estimate our effective tax rate for 2012 will be approximately 30%. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share. While we have seen positive economic signs in our territory, we remain conservative about customer growth and usage. While weather normalized sales are up over the last 12 months, the monthly change versus the prior year has been inconsistent.","Finally, on slide 12, we are very pleased to report earlier this month we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenure spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. The committed lines of credit now total $1.8 billion, with $1.6 billion covering the entire five years and an additional $200 million over the three years for added peak construction liquidity. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plants. We are pleased that we have received an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors as well as our banks.","I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to slide 13. We are pleased the construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3. We have made progress in several years during the past quarter. We completed the installation of the Unit 2 rebar cage assembly, poured 30,000 cubic yards of nuclear concrete and begun fabricating the walls of the turbine building. We also continue to make progress on the switchyard and cooling towers and have begun training operators for the two new nuclear facilities. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is currently in use. Large component manufacture continues to progress at sites around the world.","And slide 14 shows two of those components at our facility in South Korea. The reactor vessel has completed testing and is expected to be received on-site early in 2013. The steam generators for Unit 2 are scheduled to be tested around year-end and expected to be delivered early next year.","Please turn now to slide 15 which shows the progress of the nuclear island for Unit 2 throughout the year. Over the past months, we have completed the installation of leveling concrete and the waterproof membrane which is same as between a lower mud-mat and higher strength upper mud-mat. We also completed the installation of our rebar cage on top of the mud-mats. Our next step will be to pour base mat which will be the foundation of the nuclear island. On this six-foot thick nuclear island base mat, we will the CR-10 module as pictured on slide 16. CR-10 module is nearing completion and has been fabricated on-site. As you might recall, the CR-10 has a steel frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year or early next year. So, in summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion date.","On slide 17, we review our new nuclear and Base Load Review Act filings as related \u2013 and related rate increases. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response of that request in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $52.1 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30th. This is the fifth rate increase under the BLRA. We continued to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed.","Our BLRA filings for 2012 are shown in the bottom of the slide. And as you can see on August 14th, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2012. This report provided a detailed update of capital cost incurred and updated milestones for our new nuclear project, and is available on our website. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2012 in November.","As you may remember, in May, we filed an application with the Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule set the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018. The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license, and agreement with Shaw and Westinghouse related to challenged costs for the construction of our two new nuclear units, transmission costs and additional owners costs or a non-EPC cost for which we are responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities. The hearing for this filing was held on October the 2nd and 3rd. During the hearing, we provided the Commission with an update on the project and presented evidence that our decision to pursue nuclear generation remains prudent. We anticipate receiving an order from the Commission on these items in mid-November.","On slide 18, you\u2019ll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station. On October the 12th, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outage follows an 18-month operating cycle and is the 20th for V.C. Summer since the station began commercial operation in 1984. The outage allows us to replace one-third of V.C. Summer\u2019s 157 uranium fuel assemblies and to perform preventive maintenance work that cannot be performed when the reactor is operating. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head.","This inspection is designed to find minor defects which allowed timely repairs and prevents an actual problem. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection we identified welds for four of those penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the reactor vessel showed there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the welds. We notified the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as required and developed a strategy to repair the welds. These repairs have been made successfully at other nuclear facilities. As part of the planning for this inspection V.C. Summer and Westinghouse personnel developed a detailed contingency plan if repairs were needed. We will now execute this plan. Our focus is on completing the repair safely during the outage before returning the reactor to service.","We are pleased to announce that the beginning of this scheduled outage marks the end of the first breaker-to-breaker cycle in the history of V.C. Summer. A breaker-to-breaker run is an industry term recognizing a plant that operates continuously between refueling outages and only occurs when the plant reliability is very high. V.C. Summer was connected to the grid for 501 continuous days, which also set energy production records for the station.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) And the first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar Securities. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities","","Good morning. Thanks.","Jimmy Addison","Good morning.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities","Wanted some more detail on conversation, you\u2019ve had perhaps with regulators or other outside parties on the rate case, and particularly the ROE elements, what are the sticking points? What are the pros and cons that you\u2019ve heard and obviously with interest rates where they are in some other allowed ROEs we have seen over the couple months that 10.95% appears quite high relative to peers and other financial metrics? Can you just discuss kind of again the pros and construction, what the other people involved in the case are thinking along those lines?","Jimmy Addison","Well, sure to the extent I can of course. What we have filed, we believe is very defensible. When you look at the some of the peers, it\u2019s difficult to get apples-to-apples. Some of our peers have prospective forward-looking test years. We have a historical test year. So, as I have said before by the time we start off with new rates, it\u2019s very difficult to get within 50 basis points of the ROE just because of the historical nature of the test year and the attrition that occurs. Some of the other peers have more mechanisms, if you will, around environmental matters and things like that than we do. So, you really got to be careful when you just compare numbers from across the country, because I think ours are more pure. And I think those are the kinds of factors that the commissions here in the Southeast have taken into consideration when they have granted ROEs in the past. And of course, very few of our peers in fact one is building new nuclear at the same time we do which brings increased risk as well. So, those would be the primary factors that I would suggest differentiate us.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities","Well, what are the elements in the rate case aside from the ROE that you are looking at in the settlement, where I suppose again, we are part of the most contentious issues are the ones that the other parties in the potential settlement want some clarity on?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I am going to protect the confidentiality of those discussions as I have to or else it would deteriorate into never reaching a settlement most likely, but all parties are attempting to do that so we are working hard about it. Let me just frame it by saying that the commission has a practice that they like to have any settlements presented to them at least a week before the beginning of the hearing. So, they have got ample time to consider this settlement when they are hearing the testimony from the various parties. So, that essentially means we have got the next two weeks, this week, next week to try to work something out and we are trying. And I am encouraged by the party\u2019s participation and I think everyone is serious about it.","I don\u2019t know that there are any other significant items that would have as large of an impact, particularly on earnings as would ROE. So, that\u2019s certainly a significant item, but there are other items too. For example, we have got some deferred costs related to the scrubber that we installed at the Wateree Station, that was not completely in service at the time of our last increase about 2.5 years ago. So, we agreed to defer that until this time. So, one of the items that will be up for discussion is what amortization period do you collect that deferral over. So, there is differences in opinions over that and that will go into the judgment. That\u2019s just an example.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar Securities","","Great. Thanks a lot for the detail.","Jimmy Addison","Sure.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good morning.","Jimmy Addison","Good morning.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Going back to the rate case, I\u2019m think you had said that staff and interveners have filed their testimony already, that\u2019s correct right?","Jimmy Addison","It is, that\u2019s true.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So, what did they recommend in terms of an ROE?","Jimmy Addison","Well, there is variety of recommendations. The ORS recommended 10.25% and some of the other parties that made other lower recommendations and of course ours was at 10.95%. So, you\u2019ve got ranging from anywhere in the 9.5 or so percent range to our 10.95%.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","The lowest was 9.5%?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, I don\u2019t know precisely what the lowest, but was in that range.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then you talked about deferral period, so are other any other big issues that particularly the staff brought up other than that and ROE?","Jimmy Addison","I don\u2019t recall any other significant issues those are the most significant.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then you mentioned that you found some \u2013 during the inspection of Summer 1 that there is going be some repairs on the welds, so I was wondering do you have a sense yet for how long the outage is going to be then at that unit?","Steve Byrne","Yeah, Dan, it\u2019s Steve. We anticipate that we\u2019re going to add about somewhere between two and three weeks to outage scope.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and what was the original plan?","Steve Byrne","Original was around 40 days, so we ought to have the unit back on somewhere in the first or second week of December.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then I was wondering if you could give us just a little more color on what you\u2019re seeing in your service territory from industrial sector, I know you mentioned that you have that customer with the fire comeback on line, but beyond that and given that you\u2019ve had a number of new like the Boeing plant stuff like that what we see\u2026?","Jimmy Addison","We\u2019ve had \u2013 2011 was an extremely strong year. The announcements have been slower this year, but what\u2019s occurring now is some of the announcements what were made in the past of course were starting to materialize now. One of the more significant ones of those is a pharmaceutical manufacturer that\u2019s locating a facility in fact just cross the interstate here from our corporate headquarters and they are looking to add about 700 jobs or so very, very good jobs in the $70,000 to $80,000 range. So, we\u2019re seeing the lot of these kind of coming into fruition now so while the announcements aren\u2019t as much, that\u2019s encouraging. And overall and as I said earlier industrial sales if this one industrial customer were at full level would be up about 1.5% on a weather normal basis.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, and then my last questions relates to your financing plan and I was wondering where you stand related to potential loans from the DOE?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, we\u2019re \u2013 the position really hasn\u2019t changed there Dan. We continued to communicate with the DOE, but as we\u2019ve constructed this project from the beginning to be financed with public debt and equity and that has been supported very well to-date, and as I said earlier supported by the banks tremendously in renewing and raising our credit facility. So, this point we don\u2019t envisioning \u2013 envision participating in that although if things could change down the road.","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Jimmy Addison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Hi, how are doing?","Jimmy Addison","Good.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","I just wanted to go over, I guess the guidance where it comes out I guess you have it. As you \u2013 Jimmy as we look at next year because you don\u2019t file rate cases on electric side so often. And we will get double whammy, right. We will have the BLRA increase which has happened. And I guess \u201813, \u201814, \u201815 are big high CapEx and rate base years. But then you will also have your rate increase which is coming in I believe effective January 1. So, as we look at it shouldn\u2019t earnings be growing at higher than the \u2013 your range that you have forecasted, because the rate case is going to expound the results with the release? Is that a fair assumption as we look at 2013 that the earnings should be higher than the top end of the range that you have mentioned as part of the long-term?","Jimmy Addison","Well, two things. First of all, we are still comfortable with the range, if there becomes a point that we think that range is inaccurate, we\u2019ll certainly update the range for you, but secondly, there is no certainty yet around the rate case. So, normally, we like to provide the following year guidance on this call and we are just not in position to do that this year, because of such a significant variance variable factor that is with the rate case. So, we are going to need to wait until our year end call to do that, but we are still comfortable with the range at this point.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Yeah, Jimmy, you didn\u2019t understand my question. My question is on the range is long-term range it\u2019s not a one-year range, if I am right, the way I look at your range unless you can correct me?","Jimmy Addison","You are correct.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","You are correct.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay. So, that\u2019s the number one assumption, okay. Second, I am saying is because you don\u2019t file rate cases every year that the year that you have a rate case decision coming pending, and it\u2019s a pretty hefty rate case. Shouldn\u2019t you be above that range because of a double whammy effect of the BLRA and the rate case? So, you should technically be higher than the range, and of course, the range will go down some years and everything, but technically you should be higher on that range next year?","Jimmy Addison","I think I do understand your question, but I don\u2019t believe that to be the case. Of course, the rate case, there is a lots of expenses that come along with that case too if you were listening earlier and I was talking about the amortization period. There will be revenue associated with that amortization, but there will be a dollar in expense for every dollar in revenue associated with it too. So, that will create no margins, no earnings at all, that\u2019s simply a dollar for dollar wash in collecting the cash that we have already spent. So, and I know you are aware that. That\u2019s just one example. But I really don\u2019t think that will be the case next year.","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay, thank you.","Jimmy Addison","You are welcome.","Operator","(Operator Instructions) The next question will be from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Hi, how are you doing?","Steve Byrne","Good Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","I\u2019m just \u2013 most of my stuff was asked, but the litigation or excuse me disagreements with contractors or anything, do you guys I am sorry if I understood, it\u2019s been a crazy morning. Is there any issue there that you\u2019d like to talk about or you could describe like you see it obviously with another company that\u2019s building a nuclear plant?","Steve Byrne","Yeah, Paul, this is Steve. I think I can\u2019t speak to that other company.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Sure.","Steve Byrne","Building the nuclear plant and what their disagreements may or may not be, but we have had some disagreements with our contractors that we have negotiated and settled. That settlement was made earlier this year and the expenses associated with that settlement were included in the Base Load Review Act update filing that we made and presented to our Public Service Commission in early October. So, we\u2019ve settled those disputes from our perspective without having to go the litigation round.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay. Nothing new was developed since then, right?","Steve Byrne","We have nothing new that we are aware of.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And could you give us a feeling as to \u2013 and I apologize if just I can\u2019t recall right now, what the total amount was that you guys settled on?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, we \u2013 the amount to SCE&G in that settlement with Shaw and Westinghouse was $138 million.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And that\u2026","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s our 55% piece.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","That\u2019s what you got. Okay, that\u2019s your 55% piece. And what was the total amount that was in disagreement? Sorry to touch on this spot if you don\u2019t want to come back to me, that\u2019s okay.","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, I am trying to remember what the total was. It was something I believe, just short of $400 million. It was in that range anyway.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And that was the total amount or just the amount that was SCE&G\u2019s disputed amount?","Jimmy Addison","I think that $400 millionish was the total amount.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then with respect to the economy and stuff, it looks like you guys are on a 12-month running basis it\u2019s coming up, it\u2019s improving, anymore sort of outlook or flavor you could give for us on that?","Jimmy Addison","No, it is up across all categories on a 12-month basis residential up about 1%, commercial up about 0.5%. And then industrial, if you pro forma in a full year run-rate for that one customer, I mentioned it would be up almost 1.5% also. So, things continued to go well there. I hear from the commerce folks here in South Carolina that there are lot of things pending, they are just not ready for announcement yet. I also have mentioned earlier, I think port traffic at the Port of Charleston was up significantly in Q3, up over 10% year-over-year and that is a significant factor in South Carolina as it is such a heavy driver in the economy.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And is there any change in usage patterns or anything else that you are detecting there, I mean, obviously the economy is doing better than everything but is it coming in pretty much as you expected or any thought on that?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah. I\u2019d say if anything Paul, it\u2019s slightly on the upside. We have been fairly conservative just because of the erratic nature of it. I would say its still \u2013 still not a linear trend, so we have still got to kind of keep our fingers crossed on the thing, but as a whole, I would say things are looking a little better than we had expected earlier in the year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Jimmy Addison","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from David Paz of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hello, good morning.","Jimmy Addison","Hello, David.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just actually following up on the last question, when you said that residential power, sales were up about 1%, are you referring to a weather adjusted number?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s correct.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, commercial diesel was 1.5% as well and there is not a lot of weather there?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah. Commercial is about a 0.5% where industrial would be about 1.5% if you included a full year comparable period for that one industrial customer that was down due to the fire.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Alright, great, thanks. And then picking up on actually Ashar\u2019s question, can I just get a sense, I think you've said this in the past, but remind me how much incremental pre-tax margin would come from your requested rate increase, net of all the costs?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, based on what was filed about $50 million.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That\u2019s pre-tax.","Jimmy Addison","After-tax.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","After tax, okay, I want to confirm that. Thanks. And then in looking at the ORS\u2019 recommendation, do you happen to know what are the difference between their recommendation and your request, how much of that is associated with the differing ROEs on a dollar basis?","Jimmy Addison","Well, that\u2019s 74 basis points, that\u2019s about 30, little over $30 million $30, $32 million.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it, great. And actually going back to Q4, \u201811, can you remind me was there any weather benefit or hit that you guys experienced in that quarter?","Jimmy Addison","David, let me back up your last question first to be sure I am clear, because we are talking after-tax and then pre-tax numbers. The last information I gave you about the $30 million or so, that\u2019s pre-tax.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Pre-tax right?","Jimmy Addison","Yeah. So, the earlier one was after-tax the 50 and that ROE estimate was pre-tax.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. Yeah, and\u2026","Jimmy Addison","So, you asked about weather?","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The weather impact in Q4 \u201911?","Jimmy Addison","Q4 \u201811 would be Georgia, really\u2026","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Actually normal.","Jimmy Addison","Slightly milder normal, I believe, but I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips, David.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Alright, no problem. I can follow-up later. And then just the last on O&M, in your script you have talked \u2013 you touched on O&M, I think you\u2019ve said that you expected O&M to slightly or modestly increase full year \u201812 versus full year \u201811. I guess, can you confirm that and is that the actual O&M that you see this year, or is that based on the pro forma you included in the rate cases just want to get a sense of?","Jimmy Addison","Right. You see the actual that we are seeing this year, so I think year-to-date it\u2019s in the 1.5% to 2% range up. So, something around that would be what we would expect for the full year, and of course, those that come in as part of the rate case those new expenses would not go into effect until January of \u201813 when the revenue accompanied them.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And I think you said about that you would see some of that trend go into \u201813 is that should we see roughly same percentage basis or would it\u2026.","Jimmy Addison","Yeah, I think something in the 1% to 2% range would be the best ballpark. Of course that can change a lot, just based on this earlier discussion we had about these amortization periods.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay, great. Thanks so much.","Jimmy Addison","But there will be no margin impact from that once you\u2019ve shorter period, more revenue, longer period and less revenue.","David Paz \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right, right, alright. Thanks again.","Jimmy Addison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Addison for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer","Well, thank you. And just to summarize, we are pleased with our results for the third quarter.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2015. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update of our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions.

The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under Webcasts & Presentations.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.69 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The decrease in earnings in the fourth quarter is mainly attributable to the negative impact of weather on electric margins, as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business. Lower gas margins also reflect $0.07 per share of lost margins due to the sale of CGT early in the year.","These losses were partially offset by higher electric margins, due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense as a result of a new depreciation study. And lower O&M expense due primarily to labor savings and the impact of the sales of CGT during the first quarter of 2015. Note, too, that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.14 per share and $0.02 per share versus normal in the fourth quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.","Please turn to Slide 4. Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $5.22 versus $3.79 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense and O&M, as described earlier.","These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins -- primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.23 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and the impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business. And normal increases in CapEx related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution. Although electric margins reflected a negative $0.13 per share due to weather year over year, abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years, accounting for $0.08 per share in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014.","Slide 5 shows earnings on a GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized basis. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2015 were $0.83 per share compared to $0.75 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Full-year earnings were $3.73 per share in 2015 compared to $3.58 per share in the prior year. As a reminder, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins, and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015.","Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure, as gas margins are weather-normalized for the North and South Carolina businesses. And the direct impact of abnormal weather on the Georgia business is generally insignificant. However, the extremely mild weather in the fourth quarter of 2015 was seen in that business as standalone results, as I'll discuss later.","Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's fourth-quarter 2015 earnings were down $0.01 per share compared to the same period of 2014. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins due to abnormal weather, and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense and property taxes.","These decreases more than offset increases due to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas businesses, the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates, and lower O&M due primarily to labor savings. For the full-year 2015, earnings were higher by $0.12 per share due to increased electric margins, primarily from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, and customer growth, improved gas margins due to customer growth, and the application of new depreciation rates.","These items were partially offset by the effective abnormal weather on electric margins and higher expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, dilution, and continued increases in depreciation exclusive of the impact of the depreciation study. Although weather in both years contributed favorably to electric margins versus normal, 2015 was milder than 2014, with weather contributing $0.08 of margin versus normal in 2015 compared to $0.21 in 2014. PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.17 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.16 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth. For the year ended December 2015, earnings are $0.38 per share compared to $0.39 per share in the prior year.","SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in fourth-quarter earnings of $0.06 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year. Primarily due to lower throughput and margins attributable to the extremely warm weather during the fourth quarter of 2015 as compared to 2014, partially offset by lower bad debt expense. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2015, earnings were down $0.05 per share compared to the same period of 2014, due to the same drivers as the quarter.","On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins at our marketing business were primarily offset by foregone earnings contributions from the subsidiaries that were sold during the fourth quarter of this year. For the 12 month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.36 in 2015 compared to $0.01 loss in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS was down $0.04 from the prior year, due primarily to foregone earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year. Offset by lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business.","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 7. In 2015, companies announced plans to invest over $2 billion with the expectation of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.7%.","At the top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina employment statistics as of December 2015 and 2014. Over the course of 2015, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped over a percentage point from its level at the end of 2014. December of 2015 also marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. Of particular interest, and attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 80,000 or 3.8% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Said another way, had the labor force not increased during 2015, the unemployment rate would be approximately 3%. The expansion of the labor force is simply evidence of the confidence of some of the workforce to re-enter the market, and the positive migration to the State of South Carolina.","As depicted on the bottom of the slide, United Van Lines recently released its annual mover study for 2015, which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the third consecutive year, South Carolina finished ranked second in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth statistics. North Carolina has also been ranked in the Top 5 for the last three years.","Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis. In conjunction with the continued improvement of economic conditions in South Carolina, the past two quarters have shown an accelerating improvement in usage in the residential market.","And now please turn to Slide 10, which recaps our regulator rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.6 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2015 in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.","As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% and 10.6% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina, respectively. In response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in our North Carolina business, yesterday PSNC notified the North Carolina Utilities Commission of its intention to file a rate case. We plan to file the detailed case within the next 60 days, where more clarity will be provided. As you will recall, in South Carolina, if the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending in March falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June.","Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of New Nuclear spending through 2018, and has been updated to reflect what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC that was announced in October 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated New Nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. Slide 12 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan.","And now please turn to Slide 13 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open rocket purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. And again, the election of the fixed price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continued to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50\/50 debt and equity basis.","On Slide 14, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view, and are increasing the lower band of our long-term growth rate from 3% to 4%. We are also resetting our base year to 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73.","Therefore, our new GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized annual growth guidance target will be to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over the three to five years using a base of 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum, driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage base retail electric returns, and our view of the economy, balanced with our continued assumption of the impacts of energy conservation and efficiency standards. I also wanted to mention that earlier today we announced an increase of $0.12 in our annual dividend rate for 2016, to $2.30 per share, a 5.5% increase. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with earnings, while staying within our stated pay-out policy of 55% to 60%.","And finally, on Slide 15, we are very pleased to report that in late December, we successfully completed the syndication of an expanded and extended credit facility. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction project and accelerated CapEx spending at PSNC. The committed lines of credit now total $2 billion. I would like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs, and therefore, the support of our nuclear expansion plans.","We are pleased that we continue to receive an excellent response for our nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors, as well as our banks. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the Consortium. Slide 16 presents the outline we have shown in previous discussions, as a recap. As you may be aware, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager at the New Nuclear construction-site on January 4.","We continue our analysis of the fixed price option, and will include input from Fluor as they progress. As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option or not. And we plan to take as much time as needed to insure that we make the most prudent decision. Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. As Jimmy said earlier, we expect to reach a conclusion in the second quarter.","Moving on to some of the activities at the New Nuclear construction-site, Slide 17 presents an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. I've provided this photo to give you a view of the layout of the site. And I've labeled both Units 2 & 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call the table top. On Slide 18, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. In this picture you can see Module CA20 on the right hand side of the slide along the containment vessel Ring Number 1, which was placed on and welded to the lower bowl. Several of the large structural modules have now been placed inside the Unit 2 containment vessel. As we will discuss shortly, you can also see the beginnings of the shield building, as three courses have now been placed.","Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Module CA04 was placed inside the containment vessel lower bowl back in June, and the auxiliary building walls continue to go further. As you'll see shortly, we are making progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessel structural modules on both units. Slide 20 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. I've shown this schematic numerous times before because this expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA01 through CA05 fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As we you may know, we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit 2, and CA04 for Unit 3.","Slide 21 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned last quarter, CA02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation. Slide 22 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03, which is the west wall of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. 15 of CA03s 17 sub-modules are on-site, and 12 are now on their assembly platform. Slide 23 shows a picture of the Unit 3 module CA05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication on the Unit 3 CA05 has been completed, and it has been staged outside the modular assembly building, or MAB.","Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit 3 CA20, which is the auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. 68 of the 72 sub-modules are on-site, and 20 of those sub-modules have been upended on the construction platform or flattened for fabrication in the MAB. Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit 3 module CA01. Module CA01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 15 of the 47 sub-modules on-site, and three of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together in the MAB.","Slide 26 shows the progress of the placement of the Unit 2 shield building panels. The first six-panel course was placed during the first half of 2015. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the second six-panel course was set on top of the first course. And at the beginning of this month, we placed the third six-panel course. As the shield building panels are placed and welded together, concrete is poured inside the panels to create the shield building. Concrete has been placed in the first two courses. Slide 27 shows a couple of pictures from the Unit 2 turbine pedestal concrete placement from December of 2015. Overall, more than 2,300 cubic yards of concrete was placed over the course of about 20 hours.","Slide 28 shows a picture of the single phase for the 230-ton Unit 2 main transformers. There are four such transformers for each unit. And here you can see one of the four being rigged for placement adjacent to the Unit 2 turbine building. Each unit will have these four, plus six other transformers. All 10 of them in place for Unit 2, and all 10 have been received for Unit 3. On Slide 29, you'll see the New Nuclear CapEx, actual and projected, over the life of the construction. This chart shows CWIP during the years 2008 to 2020, reflecting the Q4 of 2015 BLRA quarterly report that we filed in February. As a reminder, the BLRA report now reflects the cost from the October 2015 amended EPC. As you can see, we're currently in the middle of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right-hand axis.","Please now turn to Slide 30. As we mentioned during our third-quarter call in September, the PSC approved a rate increase of $64.5 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2016 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter, and our next quarterly update will be filed in mid May. Not depicted here, but in the update filing I addressed earlier, the timing of that petition isn't yet known.","Finally, I wanted to mention the results of an analysis performed at the direction of the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. As you may be aware, the ORS contracted an independent accounting firm to determine whether the revised rate provision under the Base Load Review Act is cost-beneficial to SCE&G customers, consistent with our claims. This independent attestation, and concluded in January, and reaffirmed the significant cost advantage of the BLRA as envisioned when the law was originally passed. This report is available on the ORS's Web site, and a link to the independent accounting firm's report can be found in the regulatory document section of the Nuclear Development area of SCANA's Investor Web site. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","A couple questions on the 4% to 6% growth rate, can you just elaborate again on how that's calculated? How we should think about the out years? Because if somebody were to do a linear analysis, 2016 would be less than the 4%, if you are just growing 2016 versus 2015, did I make sense, or have I been on too many conference calls today?","Jimmy Addison","The first part of your question made sense. So how we calculate it is, the average of the annual increases over that three- to five-year period. So we're comfortable that, that average growth in our plan today is at that 4% to 6% level. Now, the second part I'm not sure I followed.","Jim von Riesemann","Yes, I don't think I followed it either. But it's just really to get to 2016 versus 2015, because you're not on a 4% plain year over year, especially with your guidance of $4.","Jimmy Addison","You are saying it\u2019s above it right?","Jim von Riesemann","Yes.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, and so -- but that's why we consider it over the entire period, not just any one year. So every year wouldn't necessarily be within that cone, but overall, the average would be.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay that I understand. So the question then becomes, with the fixed price option and your updated CapEx on the slides, how much of that is reflective -- is anything reflected in, I guess, either your growth rate or for the fixed price option in your CapEx, or even your earnings growth rate?","Jimmy Addison","So the CapEx is based upon the amended agreement. It does not include the fixed price option. And that's what our growth rate is based upon. I'm not sure that, if we were to adopt that option, that it would have a material impact on the earnings growth rate. But if we do later this year, and if it's approved, we will certainly consider that.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And then I guess I have a question on bonus depreciation.","Jimmy Addison","Sure.","Jim von Riesemann","Previously, that was about 75 million a year. Have you updated those numbers given the tax extenders from December?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, that still is a good reference, the 75 million a year in the base business. And of course, what's different now is the five-year view; so we have not had that in the past. So there's obviously the potential for the New Nuclear units themselves to qualify for bonus depreciation. Although not at the 50% level, because it phases down to 40% and 30% in 2018 and 2019, respectively, so that's the only thing that's outside that $75 million estimate.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And then I guess the last question, really, maybe is for Steve. How -- if you think about all of the components to build the two summer units, how much of them are still, say, overseas and still need to be shipped to the place? Or are most of the components on-site at this point in time?","Steve Byrne","A majority of the major components are on-site. I would say about 85%, and the remainder would be either overseas or domestic production. Of the major components left outstanding that would be overseas -- let's see, one of the -- we've got two steam generators in Tucson. One of those is being shipped; the other one is nearing completion. I think all of the turbine generator stuff is on-site, condenser stuff is on-site, containment is on-site. We've got a couple of passive heat exchangers that are being reworked in Italy. Those should be finished shortly. We had cone pumps; those are domestic, but those won't show up until 2017. That's most of the major stuff.","Now, when we get into sub-modules, we still have some of the sub-modules for the structural modules, particularly for the trailing unit, Unit 3. They are still in fabrication. And so for example, CA01 is being fabricated between Toshiba in Japan and IHI in Japan. There are 47 different sub-modules that are associated with the unit. 15 have been delivered, 15 of the 47. Seven have shipped. It just takes awhile for them to get here. And so the 25 are yet to be shipped. So we've got almost half of those are either on-site or on the ocean. So I think if I were to categorize it, 85% of the major equipment is on-site. And of the remaining stuff, a lot of it is physically complete. Some of it is waiting to be shipped; some is on the ocean now, on its way to our site.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein","Hi, this is Mike Weinstein, a couple of questions. One, did you say what was causing the drop-off in industrial growth, weather-adjusted?","Jimmy Addison","No, I really didn't address that. It's not a significant change, just showing down there about 0.5%. The one thing that makes it difficult to really address this quarter is, as you'll probably remember from the national news is, we had a historic flood in central South Carolina. And there was an extensive impact on our industrial customers -- everything from as simple as logistics of workers not being able to get to plants, to industrial intakes malfunctioning because of the extremely high water, to impacts on rail. So it's really difficult to quantify that, so I'm not too alarmed by one period here of slightly down.","Mike Weinstein","Okay. And what's causing the steep drop in SCE&G's on the gas side, on its ROE versus PSNC. Which, when you look at the September numbers, there's almost no change in North Carolina, but South Carolina really seems to have come off.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, it's a function of obviously the rate base additions, as well as the operating cost, et cetera, involved in the units, and as well as the timing. I believe the South Carolina number is as of September 30, and the PSNC number is, I believe, at December 31. We just haven't filed the South Carolina report yet, so we haven't updated that one.","Mike Weinstein","All right, that makes sense. And on the nuclear side, the CapEx looks like it's about $200 million higher in the peak spending years, 2017 and 2018. And it seems to flow through right into the CWIP. And I'm just wondering, does that mean that -- does that result in higher BLRA rate increases going forward? And is that a result of the new -- that's all as a result of the settlement, right?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, so the CapEx numbers haven't changed at all from what we presented in the third quarter. And this assumes just the amended agreement, not the fixed price option. All that's changed is the timing of when they occur in this presentation, Michael, so that's really the only adjustment.","Mike Weinstein","Okay, it's just a timing issue.","Jimmy Addison","Yes.","Mike Weinstein","Okay all right and I guess thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","You mentioned the second quarter, wanted to make the decision then on the fixed price option. Wondered if you could give me a timeline and thoughts on why you wouldn't wait until November? And then secondly, if you do make that decision in the second quarter, what's the regulatory schedule look like from that point?","Jimmy Addison","Let me start and then let Steve jump in. So we said that it's likely to be Q2. That's our best judgment. But Steve also said in the opening comments that we have until November. And if we think we need all that time, we will take all that time. So we're just giving you our most likely estimate of when we think we'll have a good assessment of Fluor's input, et cetera, to make that call. And at the point that we feel like we have that and have our information together, we'll make a filing with the Public Service Commission. And then they have their statutory six months to rule on that. And ballpark, sometime in the middle of that six months, we would be before them to present our information to ask for their support.","Steve Byrne","Travis, this is Steve. One train of thought would be, take as long as you've got to make the decision, which we fully understand. But we did in an ex parte fashion, brief our Public Service Commission on the two options that we would have going forward. And what we told them was as soon as we were complete with our evaluation we would come back to them with the option that we selected. So we intend to do that. One complicator that you might not see that makes my life a little more difficult is that in the interim, I have to sort of keep two sets of books. So I have to base assumptions on both where we're exercising the fixed price option and we're not exercising the fixed price option. And if we're going to exercise one or the other, it's a lot simpler for me -- I can drop the other set of the books. So it takes all kinds of commercial issues off the table and just makes our lives a lot easier.","Travis Miller","So you briefed the regulators. Has there been any conversation or interaction with interveners or other groups that you think might have opposition to, say, the fixed price option, or at least a preference to one or the other?","Steve Byrne","Yes, we've done a number of briefings, some of which were public. We did a briefing for the legislature, for example. We've done briefings with the governor's Nuclear Advisory Council. And some of the interveners were present during the ex parte briefing we had last November with the Public Service Commission. But there was no interaction with them at that point in time. So we have and will continue to have some interactions, but we don't know who all of the interveners might be until we file something. And then they're given the opportunity to intervene. So it's not a surprise, but we won't have any more conversation with our Public Service Commission until we make a filing. We aren't allowed to have any conversation with them about the topic.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Steven Byrd","I wanted to just talk about Toshiba for a moment. Toshiba has been in the press of late. And at a high level, just wanted to understand, as you think about their credit position and safeguards and protections for you, how should we think about ways that you can receive protection against potential deterioration in credit quality at Toshiba?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, well, let me just talk briefly about some contract provisions in a conceptual form, and then I'll let Steve talk some operationally about the project. So we do have some security provisions in the contract if their ratings fall below a certain grade, and they have triggered those now. And we have initiated that security. And for confidentiality reasons, I'm just not going to get into the details of what that is, how much it is, et cetera. But it's essentially meant to handle any kind of payment obligations were they not to be able to pay subcontractors, things of that nature. As well as performance obligations if they don't live up to their terms of the contract, so that's kind of the financial construct that's in the contract that we have pulled the trigger on. And I'll just let Steve talk a little about the project itself.","Steve Byrne","Yes, we've been tracking the situation at Toshiba. Obviously a very large company, I think the Japanese government would be loath to see them fail. But they have submitted obviously a restructuring plan. We were heartened to see in their restructuring plan that they intend to stay in the energy business. While they do intend to shed some of their business lines, they are going to stay in the energy business, which would include nuclear, so that's a good thing for us. Also we are glad to see that, with the significant changes in leadership and the board at Toshiba, that the person that we have been largely dealing with in the nuclear arena survived that turmoil. And again, we think that's a good thing.","I do believe that Toshiba has been successful at securing some debt from some large Japanese banks just recently. Bankruptcy also doesn't necessarily mean that things would stop. There are various kinds of bankruptcies. Not that we think it will get to that point, but it doesn't necessarily mean things at the site will stop. And in addition to the sort of the financial protections that Jimmy just alluded to, we did actually forecast a situation like this back when we were negotiating the EPC contract. Not necessarily that we thought that the larger corporation, Toshiba, might have financial difficulties. But we were really focusing on perhaps the smaller corporations like Westinghouse and\/or Shaw might have some financial difficulties. So we do have in the contract some provisions to escrow intellectual properties, such that if there were to be a succession of operations by the contractor, that we could finish the plant on our own.","Steven Byrd","And just shifting over to the Sanmen project in China, just wondered if you had any update there in terms of the status of Sanmen?","Steve Byrne","I don't have any recent updates on Sanmen. We have a team that's supposed to go over there, I think it's in the April or May timeframe. So we'll get more firsthand information then. My understanding is that we still anticipate that Sanmen 1 will come online sometime this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Weisel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Two questions, first one is about the new long-term growth rate. Could you maybe talk outside of whether a major pick-up in the economy, what are some factors that could potentially take you to or above the high-end of that 6% level?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I think the largest kind of at-risk variable from a positive or a negative standpoint, Andrew, is probably what happens with usage on electric, on the electric side, unrelated to weather. So what goes on in that area I mean, it's obviously related to the economy, but what do people do with everyday electric consumption? And that's been very difficult for our industry to model the last several years. It flattened out and was slightly up for us in 2015. That surprised us in a good way, a little. But that continues to be the most difficult thing for us to model.","Andrew Weisel","Anything on the capital side, obviously the nuclear CapEx estimates are constantly being adjusted. But anything in the base business that might get you, like I said, toward or above the high-end? Or potentially anything that can go wrong that would take you below that low-end?","Jimmy Addison","We feel pretty good about our CapEx plan. I mean, setting aside the New Nuclear, as you said in your question, which has the dynamic adjustment due to the project. We are doing in the base business the things we need to do to have safe, reliable power. But we aren't doing a great deal of things beyond that in order to maintain no base rate increases during this period, or pressure on returns, if we were not to have increases. PSNC is probably the biggest story outside of that, with the growth in that area, particularly in the transmission area. And of course, we said earlier that we filed yesterday a notice of a pending rate increase there. But that is fairly well laid out. That could change some, based upon price of steel, and compression, and that kind of thing, over time. But I don't expect it to vary a great deal.","Andrew Weisel","And then my other question is about the dividend. Obviously a bigger increase today than what we've seen in the past few years. And that takes you right to the midpoint of your targeted pay-out ratio, if we assume the midpoint of the EPS guidance. Going forward, should we expect the dividend to grow more of that kind of 5% range, which is the midpoint of the EPS growth? Or would it be more likely to revert back to the 3% or 4% range like what we've seen in the past several years?","Jimmy Addison","Yes if you'll bear with me, let me give you 30 seconds of history here. When the recession hit and earnings slowed a great deal, we got outside of our pay-out policy of 55% to 60%. We got up close to 65% -- 63% to 65%. We continued to grow dividends during those next few years, but we grew them at about half the rate of earnings growth, so that we could get back within the policy. And now we're comfortably back within the policy, and our position at this point is, we expect to grow those dividends fairly consistent with earnings growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Jenkins with The State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","So first of all, I was just curious, on your financing plan for 2016, you show about $1 billion for SCE&G. I was wondering if you could give any insight as to the timing, would that be like throughout the year, or first half, second half?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, so today, we would model in roughly half of it about mid-year and half of it near the end of the year. That is definitely going to need to be dynamically adjusted to which option we end up electing, and the payment schedule that goes along with that, that we've talked about on the last call, as well as briefly on this one. So that's really going to cause adjustments in that schedule. So I'm fairly sure it will adjust from this, but today's best guess is about half mid-year and about half near the end of the year.","Dan Jenkins","Going to the nuclear unit, and in particular, I looked through the report you just filed for the fourth-quarter report. And in particular, it mentioned how the shield building is one of the primary critical path of things -- items that's potentially could, I guess -- some of those modules you're having trouble with, or whatever. So I was wondering if you could expand on that, and what the timing is, you think, when that item will be able to be resolved?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I think the shield building items -- when you say resolved I think we resolved most of our shield building issues there. The biggest issue that we had really was, they anticipated that the fit-up of this first-of-a-kind items, taking these individual panels that come from Newport News Industrial, or NNI, and then putting them together at the site, welding them up within the tolerances, and then filling them with concrete -- was going to be very difficult. We've done a lot of mock-ups. We've received probably half the panels for the first unit and maybe 25% for the second unit. The placement so far ought to be categorized as going a little better than we had anticipated. So we've got 16 courses of steel panels that go in a ring that we eventually will fill with concrete. We've placed the first three of those courses already. The first two have been welded, fit and we poured concrete in. And the third course, we recently placed, so we're welding that. But again, that's going, I think, better than we had anticipated.","So now our focus, since that is the critical path, is insuring that we get the sub-modules, the pieces, the panels, from NNI in a timely fashion. So Westinghouse has taken over the contract that CB&I used to have, so that's now exclusively a Westinghouse-to-NNI deal, which we think is good. And then the delivery schedule looks to be good. And they're negotiating a mitigation strategy. And in effect I'll be going to NNI tomorrow to talk through the mitigation strategy that will accelerate some of those panel deliveries to the site. So I think the shield building, right now it's going pretty well. But it is our focus area, because it is critical path.","Dan Jenkins","And then similarly, it talks a little bit about secondary critical paths being the CA20 and CA01 for Unit 3. Are those like parallel paths to the shield building issues, or are they dependent on the shield building path?","Jimmy Addison","No, Dan, not necessarily dependent on the shield building. But they would come in right in line after the shield building. So once we demonstrate proficiency with shield building, then you focus on whatever is next. So we're always looking at primary, secondary, tertiary critical paths. So the secondary critical path is, as you mentioned, that CA20 module for the trailing Unit 3. We've already set CA20 for Unit 2 obviously. And we did come up with an interesting mitigation strategy for the CA20 module, whereas, on the first unit, on Unit 2, we set it as one piece. On the second one, we're going to set it in two halves. And so that will save us probably a couple of months in the fabrication. And that's important, because it actually forms a part of the concrete form work for the rest of the plant. So it's important that we set that half of that, and use it as a form concrete while we're working on the second half, and then set the second half. So as of right now, I thought that, that was -- that the team on-site came up with that plan, we're executing on that plan, and we ought to set that first half, CA20, for the second unit, in Q1, late Q1. And then we should set the second half of CA20 for Unit 3 probably early in Q2.","Dan Jenkins","And somewhat related to that, it mentions on -- I don't know if you have the report in front of you -- on page 15 of it, in the middle of it, kind of related to the CA01 and CA20. That on the current schedule, the date doesn't support the construction schedule for the units, so how is that being impacted in the overall schedule? How should we think about that? How much can that be mitigated?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I think a good example of mitigation is the plan that we came up with to split the CA20 module into two halves. And CA01, we're looking at similar things there. We're looking to expedite the delivery of the sub-modules from IHI and Toshiba in Japan. Toshiba obviously has all the incentive in the world under the agreement that we negotiated in October to expedite whatever they can. So they both have -- since they're the parent company of Westinghouse, there are both penalties if they don't do things on time, and there are significant bonus incentives if they do finish on time. So they've got as much incentive as we could possibly put into an agreement. So we'll look to accelerate the schedule for the modules coming out of Japan for CA01. And we're implementing a strategy to split CA20, set it in two halves instead of one large piece [indiscernible] CA20 portion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reeder","One quick point of clarity, so if Fluor's assessment of the schedule comes back that the current schedule isn't kind of feasible, how does that work then? Do you have to then negotiate another amended EPC contract before you would file that with the Commission so that the benchmarks, the milestones, are set appropriately in the next kind of approved BLRA?","Jimmy Addison","Jonathan, I think the short answer is, it depends on how far out they are. If you'll remember with our last order from the Public Service Commission, we had a plus 18 months for each of the milestones. So as long as we stay within that 18 months, we don't need to go back in on the schedule. So really, it's going to depend on how far. But what I more envision is that Fluor might come back and say -- in order to get the schedule on time, you have to accelerate this, you might have to bring in more resources than we have in the current plan. So where we think we're going to peak at, say, 4,000 craft employees, they might come back and say -- you need to get 4,500 craft employees. And that kind of an input might drive us towards opting for the fixed price, because more people mean more dollars.","Jonathan Reeder","Right, so that would impact, I guess, the non-fixed price option, and probably lend more credibility towards selecting the fixed price. That's the way to think about it?","Jimmy Addison","Correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","A couple of nuts and bolts questions on the gas side of the business. First of all, at PSNC, if you filed later this Spring, when would rates go into effect? I forget, is that a 6- or a 12-month process in North Carolina?","Jimmy Addison","6.","Michael Lapides","Okay. So rates would go in no later than like January 1 next year. And that's a historical-looking rate case there, or can you do a forward or a big known immeasurable?","Jimmy Addison","It's a bit of both. It's a base historical test year, but you can kind of update for CWIP, as well as cap structure, kind of concurrent with the information being presented and any settlement being discussed or hearing before the Commission.","Michael Lapides","And on the gas side at SCE&G, when would you file under the Rate Stabilization Act to get a revenue increase? When does that normally happen, and when would that go into effect?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, so that runs through the end of the heating season, the measurement period through the end of March, and we make the filing in May of each year. And any adjustment either way, if we're 50 basis points out, would be effective the first of November for the implementation of the typical heating season in the fall although that did not happen this past year.","Michael Lapides","And then, Steve, one question I just want to make sure I understood that your comments about Toshiba and some of the financial and credit metric issues Toshiba has. And you've mentioned that you already started the process with Toshiba to kind of recover some of the security-related funds. Did you do that because of their downgrades? Did you do that because Toshiba is having issues paying some of the local subcontractors, or some of the vendors or suppliers? What was the main driver for starting the process now?","Jimmy Addison","Hi Michael this is Jimmy, I commented on that earlier, so I'll clean it up here. No, that's just procedural. It's just an option afforded us under the contract. We've had no issues that we're aware of at all with any subs being paid, or anything like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Claire Tse of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","David Paz","Hi this is actually David Paz. Sorry if I missed this earlier. Does your 4% to 6% EPS growth rate assume any bonus depreciation impact on the New Nuclear units when they come into service in 2019 and 2020?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, the guidance assumes the bonus depreciation on the base business. We've really not contemplated yet or modeled exactly what might happen with the bonus depreciation on the new units themselves. There's a lot of consideration has to go into that, along with the production tax credits, et cetera, to make sure we maximize the value for the customer.","David Paz","I see. So it's not -- it essentially hasn't been modeled in the 4% to 6%?","Jimmy Addison","Right.","David Paz","Okay. Do you happen to know, or can I find somewhere in the BLRA filings what the cumulative costs for Unit 2 would be through 2019, as you currently stand today?","Jimmy Addison","Well, on the amended contract, it's about -- the total price of the units is about $7.1 billion, so you can roughly estimate 50% of that.","David Paz","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","David, are you looking for what\u2019s been spent to-date?","David Paz","Well, not just to-date, but obviously you have the BLRAs by year. But if I knew just what Unit 2's portion was through that 2019, that's what I was trying to get a more exact number. But obviously I can ballpark it.","Jimmy Addison","Yes. We\u2019ve not broken it out between Unit 2 and Unit 3 so yes you\u2019d have to ballpark it.","David Paz","And then just can you go through the process for how each unit goes into rate base? Like is there a formal filing with the PSC when each unit is completed? How is that process?","Jimmy Addison","So what we do is, we have to prepare a projected operating cost-year, if you will, so an implementation year. The first phase of the BLRA is to get the plans approved. The second phase happens each year, are the revised rates. And the third is the operating cost going in. And so we'll have to project what the depreciation and the operating costs, et cetera, are. And that does not require a hearing. It just requires us to present it to the Office of Regulatory Staff and to the Commission like we do the revised rates each year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","I wanted to touch base with you on the last question there, on the BLRA and the bonus depreciation. It sounds like you guys were trying to -- that you were analyzing the PTC and the impact of taking bonus, and what have you. And I'm just trying to get a sense as to what that process is kind of like, and sort of some of the factors that sort of go around that, if you follow me? And how that might change the 4% to 6% potentially?","Jimmy Addison","Well, the only real impact is likely to be just on financing itself, and any temporary benefits on financing. I mean, bonus depreciation is simply accelerating a deduction that you're going to get at some point in the future, to an earlier point in time. So you aren't going to change your total taxes per books, because you're going to change your deferred taxes. So if you end up with a larger deferred tax credit because of the bonus depreciation, you're going to end up with lower rate base there in the short run. But in the very short run, it's just going to have some financing benefits to it, just like the bonus depreciation does on the base business.","Paul Patterson","Well, that's what I was wondering. I'm just wondering whether or not -- I mean, I understand that. I guess what I'm wondering is, is there any potential impact in the near term if the bonus depreciation was factored into it? In other words, how should we think about the potential sensitivity in the near term if bonus depreciation, which my understanding, is not being factored in now, if it were to come in, can you give us any rule of thumb or thought process as to if there would be impact, and what that impact might be?","Jimmy Addison","No, we're talking about something that would potentially be a cash impact in the second half of 2019, so I don't really see any near-term impact on it.","Paul Patterson","Okay. So in other words, if the bonus depreciation, there's no potential for it to take -- it would happen then regardless, it wouldn't be happening any time earlier in terms of your analysis?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right. That\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson","Okay, thanks so much for the clarity. And then just finally on the sales growth, I believe you guys, in your last IRP, were around 1.4% for retail sales growth, I think, just over the long period. Is that still pretty much what you guys are looking at?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, we\u2019re going to be filing a new IRP, what in the next few weeks Steve?","Steve Byrne","Yes. Within the next two weeks.","Jimmy Addison","And we were just reviewing a draft of that earlier this week, and I don't think where we are at, at this point is materially different. But we'll be filing that in the next few weeks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett. Please go ahead.","Jimmy Addison","Mitchell, we can\u2019t hear you.","Mitchell Moss","Sorry about that.","Jimmy Addison","Okay.","Mitchell Moss","Okay, good. Just to follow-up on some of the questions on Toshiba's credit ratings and downgrades. In terms of next steps, if there are further downgrades for Toshiba, is there a -- is it kind of like incremental steps of, if there's a single -- if Toshiba's rating moves down one more notch, there's sort of one or two more steps? Or is there sort of Toshiba has to fall several rating notches from here before you guys would need to, I guess, do further action regarding taking any security actions?","Jimmy Addison","Right, so the contractual security provisions I mentioned earlier are binary. Their ratings meet the criteria for us to elect those, or they don't. And they've met those, so there's no further impacts, there's no graded scale or anything.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. So the ratings, where they're at now, you haven't needed to take any -- there haven't been any security provisions activated, or there have been?","Jimmy Addison","There have not been in the past, we recently initiated those and they have 60 days for those to be fulfilled.","Mitchell Moss","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","And those are all of the provisions once fulfilled.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. And just on a more of a technical question, your Slide 13 I believe yes Slide 13 shows debt refinancings at SCANA in 2018 are 170 million utility is 550. Last quarter you had combined it at about 720 all that SCANA and so I just wanted to find out to better understand I see the 550 in terms of just that at the utility I just want those understand 170 million of SCANA debt is?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, that relates to the South Carolina Generating Company. But it's one plant that operates solely for SCE&G. All the power goes to SCE&G. So it's a separately financed plant, but it's solely related to -- we call it GenCo -- South Carolina Generating Company.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. So, it's not really a holding company debt.","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right but it technically is a subsidiary of SCANA and that\u2019s the reason we presented it that way.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well. Thank you so far this has been a very eventful and productive year and we're excited about the new arrangement with Westinghouse and Fleur. We continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. We thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA. Have a good afternoon.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"19256":["SCANA (NYSE:SCG) Q2 2013 Earnings Call August  1, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Byron W. Hinson - Director of Investor Relations","Jimmy E.

Weisel - Macquarie Research","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Ashar Khan","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, August 1, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic development in our service territory, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides in the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. And the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3.","Basic earnings in the second quarter of 2013 were $0.60 per share compared to $0.55 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were principally offset by increases in CapEx-related costs, including interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.","Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 6 months ended June 30, 2013, were $1.73 versus $1.48 in 2012. Similar to the quarter, increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses related to our capital program.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's second quarter basic earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2012, driven largely by base rate increases along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.17 due primarily to higher electric margin.","PSNC Energy recorded seasonally flat earnings for the second quarter of 2013, comparable to the same period of last year. For the 6-month period ended June 30, shown in red, basic earnings were $0.24 per share, in line with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, shown in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 cents per share for the second quarter, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are up $0.08, primarily due to a return to normal weather during the first quarter of 2013. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in 2012. For the 6-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013, consistent with 2012.","I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service territory as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. Through the second quarter of this year, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $1.5 billion with expectations of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're pleased that this year is shaping up to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our region. Driven by prior economic announcements, unemployment rates continue to improve. Announcements of new businesses, as well as business expansions, have translated into job creation. The unemployment rate in SCE&G's electric territory, denoted in blue, of 7% is 200 basis points better than during the peak of the recession and continues to be favorable compared to the national rate. Additionally, the U.S. Commerce Department released a survey in June noting that South Carolina led the Southeast in economic growth during 2012 with real GDP growth of 2.7%. Manufacturing is clearly playing a key role in South Carolina's economic growth.","Slide 7 presents weather-normalized sales and customer growth. The top left outlines our weather-normalized sales for the 12 months ended June, which you can see have increased slightly. From the bottom of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. In addition to the aforementioned electric growth, our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina grew at 2%. SCE&G gas hit the 2% growth mark for the first time since the third quarter of 2007. As you will note on the top right, these results are in line with our expectations.","Now I would like to speak about our operational and maintenance expenses for the year. As we've previously mentioned, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond would be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We originally estimated during the year-end call that O&M expenses would be approximately 5% higher in 2013, with about half of that increase driven by a specific rate case-related expense amortization of previously deferred items. While these amortizations are occurring as projected, the other projected expense growth has been mitigated by cost-control efforts, such as lower labor cost and the delay of certain items. We constantly scrutinize the organization for efficiencies, which has principally been accomplished through attrition to mitigate other external cost increases.","Now, please turn to Slide 8. Another factor is lower-than-planned vegetation management during the significant rainfall of the second quarter. Our crews have been able to trim approximately 300 fewer miles of transmission and distribution right of ways than they had at this point in 2012. South Carolina received substantial rainfall during the past quarter, as you can see in this picture from one of our transmission right of ways. While this photo is an extreme example, on average Colombia and Charleston, comprising the majority of our service area in SCE&G, had 15 inches of rain during the second quarter, which is approximately 50% above normal. This has kept our crews from being able to trim some of the right of ways, which has resulted in lower O&M compared to our plan. We expect most of this O&M will be spent during the balance of the year, assuming normal rainfall.","Also, outages and projects at some of our coal-fired plants have shifted from the spring of 2013 to the fall, which have caused some timing variances compared to our plan. Considering the cost-control efforts and these type of timing items, we now project full year O&M expenses to grow approximately 3.5% over 2012 levels.","Now, please turn to Slide 9, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As you can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is composed of SCE&G Electric. In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return as of the end of the second quarter of 2013 was approximately 9.9%, virtually unchanged from Q1. Again, the strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and nonnuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, is essential to achieving this goal.","Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. We've had incremental CWIP in the last year of approximately $570 million, and we expect to implement a rate increase in November of just under 2.9%. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North Carolina and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to run those businesses close to those returns. Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule outside of any Base Load Review Act or BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.","Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated with our high-level estimates of the changes in the construction cost timing due to the schedule delay we announced on June 5. These preliminary estimates reflect a delay in the in-service dates by up to 12 months for Unit 2 and a similar delay for Unit 3. The consortium, consisting of Westinghouse and CB&I, provided their preliminary estimates of the cash flow changes for Unit 2, but have yet to revise their estimates for Unit 3. We have prepared our own estimate internally to evaluate the impact of a similar deferral on Unit 3. To be clear, this is our current best estimate of the impact of the delay, and the numbers may shift intra-period as they are refined. These numbers do not include the potential increased costs of up to $200 million as we have not reached any further conclusions on those matters. Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Please turn to Slide 11 to review the net change. This reflects the shift in construction cash flows due to the change in in-service dates. You will note that incremental CWIP from 2013 to 2015 is lower than filed in the last quarterly BLRA report and is higher beginning in 2016 for the duration of the construction. Steve will address nuclear construction in a few minutes.","Please turn to Slide 12 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. We don't anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013 other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. Also in June, SCE&G issued $400 million in First Mortgage Bonds. $150 million of this issuance was used to refinance maturing First Mortgage Bonds, with the remainder used to repay short-term debt primarily incurred for construction of the new nuclear units. We've not made any changes in our financing plan at this point due to the shift in the in-service dates, as we do not expect the total cost of the project to change significantly. Once CB&I finalizes its analysis on the construction schedule and related costs, we will provide an update on our financing plans.","Now, please turn to Slide 13. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide #14. Let me start by addressing the topic we discussed at our Analyst Day event as it pertains to the new nuclear in-service dates and the associated costs.","As we stated in New York, we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018, which is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. Although we have provided you with a high-level estimate to show the shift in CapEx spend, we continue to work with the Chicago Bridge & Iron to finalize how the construction cost will shift, as well as determine what the additional costs might be for this delay along with the associated responsibility. I want to reiterate that our estimated upper bound of the additional cost to SCE&G is approximately $200 million. We hope to get more definitive information later this year.","I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 15. As I have mentioned previously, in March, we completed an over 50 hour continuous pour of nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, for our first new unit, which can be seen in the picture at the top of the slide. The basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat, which you can see at the bottom left of the slide. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted into place using a heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. As you can see at the bottom right, the containment vessel bottom head, which was also assembled on-site, was lifted into place by the heavy lift derrick in May. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as a reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer.","On the top left of Slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel lower bowl as it begins to take shape on-site. The top right of that same slide, you will see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated. On the bottom left, you'll see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Placement of the Unit 2 Turbine Building basemat and associated walls has been completed.","At the bottom right, you'll see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. We have completed the placement of the dental concrete, the leveling concrete, a lower mudmat, the vapor barrier and the upper mudmat. Currently, the reinforcing bar cage is being assembled, and we are on schedule for the first nuclear concrete Unit 3 some time around October of this year.","Early this month, we set the first condenser section in the Unit 2 Turbine Building, which you can see on Slide 17. On the top is the lift from the condenser assembly area. On the bottom left is a mid-air shot. And on the bottom right is the placement in the Turbine Building basement.","On Slide 18, you'll some components that have arrived on-site. Across the top, you'll see a photo of the Deaerator. I included this photo to show you the scale of this enormous item. It's about 140 feet long, 18 feet in diameter, and its purpose is to strip oxygen from the feedwater system. On the bottom left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel on-site. As I'm sure you're aware, the Reactor Vessel will house the fuel assemblies. On the bottom right, you'll see the low pressure turbine rotors, 2 Alpha and 2 Bravo as they arrive via railcars. There are 3 low pressure and 1 high pressure turbine rotors for each unit.","Please now turn to Slide 19. As discussed at Analyst Day, in May we filed our Base Load Review Act or BLRA quarterly status update for this first quarter of 2013 with the Public Service Commission, as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $67.2 million revenue increase or a rate increase of 2.87%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the requested increase in rates by November 1.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","One general question here. If you look out over the next 3 to 6 months, say the second half of the year, where do you see the biggest risk? Is it earnings or the operations in general? Is there something at the nuclear plant? Is it something back on just core operations at the utility, O&M? Are we just talking about weather? Where is the biggest risk, you think, to the performance in the second half?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, so this is Jimmy. I'll start off, and then let Steve jump in here later. I would say that I feel pretty good about the economy. We continue to see a lot of announcements, but the large industrials are really mixed. We are seeing some sectors, those related to housing and those related to automotive that are doing pretty well, and then some of the other sectors are really mixed. So that's a little bit uncertain, kind of like the national news on that front. O&M, I feel like we really got our hands around that and doing a really good job with that. As I said in the comments a few minutes earlier, I think we're in much better position there than we thought we would be 6 months ago. And then as it relates to weather, other than our Georgia business, all of our operations are weather-normalized, so that's really not an issue for us. And I'll let Steve speak to more about operations and the project.","Stephen A. Byrne","I think from the nuclear project perspective, the module deliveries out of the CB&I Lake Charles facility is probably our biggest concern. And when we had in Analyst Day in June in New York, we had just received the new schedule from the CB&I Lake Charles facility for some modules delivery to site. And that prompted us to reevaluate the in-service date for the units. Since that timeframe, they have been beating that schedule. So that's good news, but it's not a real long trend. So we're still watching the module facility very closely.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. That's helpful. And then just one clarification question. Over the last few months here you shifted the spending from the nuclear plant, but no additional spending. And then you gave a the guidance around the potential for the $200 million. I'm just -- am I getting that very simply correct?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, that's right. And remember, the estimate of the $200 million was our estimate, not the consortium's estimate, of what we think the additional charges could be. But we haven't yet sorted out, let's say, responsibility for some of those charges. So we anticipate that we're going to be doing that over the remainder of this year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Just on the O&M, could we just go over that again, just so I understand? I mean, you were pretty clear on it, but just -- so originally, you were expecting a 5% increase in O&M, which half of that was from things that you're getting back from rate cases, right?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right. And those are, if you will, fixed -- on fixed amortization. So that hasn't changed.","Andrew Levi","And then you expected another 2.5% kind of base O&M growth on top of that, but now you're saying that's going to be 1% for a total of 3.5%. Is that kind of the way to think of it?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right. And largely, that delta from our earlier projection to kind of our projection as to where we are today, has really been driven off of labor and labor-related costs. We're, I don't know, 100, 125 or so full-time equivalents down from where we were a year ago aside from the new nuclear project, which those costs are being capitalized as part of the project. But we continue to just look for opportunities through attrition and the operations for efficiency.","Andrew Levi","Okay, so that's something that's sustainable and doesn't have to do with the weather or tree trimming or planned outages...","Stephen A. Byrne","Absolutely.","Andrew Levi","All that stuff. Okay. So we should carry that through?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes.","Andrew Levi","Okay, great. That sounds good. And then on the sales side. I know you don't have it in your slides. But do you have any quarterly data for the second quarter, residential, commercial, industrial, weather-normalized sales?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Andy, we really don't present that. It's just, it doesn't have a full cyclical nature of the business in it. So we tend to just report the 12-month weather-adjusted.","Andrew Levi","Any flavor you can give us without being specific?","Jimmy E. Addison","Not really.","Andrew Levi","Okay, fair enough.","Jimmy E. Addison","I mean other than comments I made earlier about industrials, et cetera -- I mean look, overall, the RNC market continues to be very conscious of usage. So we grew customers at 0.8% percent, but overall usage is up 0.2% or so. So you can tell that, although you're adding new customers at a higher rate than your overall consumption's growing, then the rest of the base is using less on average. Part of that is just good news from the effectiveness of some of the demands on management programs that we're promoting, the CFL light bulbs, et cetera. Some of those are really taking effect.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then the last question I have is just on the timing\/method of new equity. Any color you can -- I mean, obviously, you said no new equity this year. Does that include a possible forward sale? If we should assume that there's no activity this year? Or is that just on the share count type of thing?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, we really haven't made any decisions around that, Andy, so I can't be absolutely definitive on it. But I'll tell you that we really don't see any need until the second half of '14 at the earliest for the actual cash. And these recent delays in the cash flow that both Stephen and I spoke about only kind of take additional pressure off of that need. So we're not anxious about doing anything in the near term.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So the last thing -- but on top of that, as far as on the equity, kind of looking at that earnings are coming in a little bit better, O&M, a little bit better. Is it possible that the amount of equity that's needed in the future could change, or are we kind of set in stone at this point?","Jimmy E. Addison","Certainly not set in stone. It could be impacted by the factors you mentioned. It could be impacted by the actual inflation that occurs as we build out the projects. So one of the most significant variables is the escalation, and we have to project that. And you may recall that we're roughly, today, projecting the total project, SCE&G's share, to cost about $0.5 billion less than when we started the project. And that's largely driven by lower inflation. Now, that could go lower, that could go higher. And if it did, generally, it would impact equity $0.50 on the dollar and debt, $0.50 on the dollar.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And obviously, debt expenses have been lowered because of lower interest rates in general, so...","Jimmy E. Addison","Absolutely. And those benefits will anew for 30 years, because we're doing 30-year fixed-rate debt.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","First question, I just want to clarify, maybe if you can repeat what you said about any changes to the CapEx. It's changes of timing related to the delays, but that does not include your estimate of up to $200 million of additional cost, did I hear that right?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's correct. All we've done is shift the cost for where we think it will occur now. But as Steve said, we've not done anything to incorporate the $200 million because, one, it's just our internal estimate, we've not got it from the consortium. And two, when we do get something from them, there will be a lot of discussion and negotiation around whose responsibility that is.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. And you said that, that's the fundamental plan over the rest of the year. Is your expectation that say, by the end of the calendar year, you'll have a better sense of that, of the sharing in the total costs?","Jimmy E. Addison","We would anticipate that by end of the calendar year, we certainly would have a better understanding of both the cost and the cash flows of those costs. But again, if we get into the negotiation process, that could be protracted based on our previous history. It's not to say that it's overly contentious. It just takes a long time to work through who we think is responsible for what portions of the cost.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. Then on the changes to the CapEx, they're a bit bigger than I was expecting since the Analyst Day. Can you maybe talk a little bit about why the numbers are 3 digits or 3 -- or almost 200 million for this year?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, I think you need to keep that in perspective. Let me just start off with this and see if Steve wants to add anything. But if you look at that net change at the bottom on the 12 months ended June here, down in the blue bar, that's what's going to drive the BLRA proceedings. The $141 million shift, we estimate at June of '14 is just slightly more than 10% of the CWIP we expect that occur -- incur during that period. So while they look significant outside of context, you put them in context, it's really about 10%, which doesn't surprise me when you're looking at moving the delivery data, the project by 9 to 12 months, and you've got 4 or 5 years left to build on it. That's not surprising to me.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's pretty helpful. Then just want to go back to the question on the weather-normalized sales growth. I understand you don't want to get too specific on the quarterly moves, but these are some pretty dramatic changes from the 12 months ended in March. Residential, in particular, was 2.5%, now it's barely over 0. I noticed you kind of took out the commentary about the industrial customer that was down, and you added this comment that it was adjusted for the leap year. Is this change mostly a change in the actual trends or in your presentation and accounting for it?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, it's not really a change in the accounting. We're dropping the industrial customer that has been down in the past because most of this tail period now has the industrial customer back in that production that they were in before, so it's not -- it's more of an apple and apple now without any type of adjustment. And then we talked about the leap year last year when it was a positive, so we'll talk about it now as it's a negative. We're just trying to be consistent. And if you really put these -- if you look on that Slide 7, up in that box on the top right, they're really fairly consistent with what we expected when we put our plan together. So yes, sales growth is slightly less than we had expected. Customer growth is about what we expected. But O&M costs are less than we had expected. So we try to really balance that 3-legged stool, and those are the key 3 levers for us.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. So if I can ask it a different way then, even though it looks like the second quarter growth really, really collapsed, you're still confident that, that was not a new normal, and that the second half, we'll see a somewhat meaningful recovery back toward the trend lines that you had expected?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, I can't predict the future, that's for sure. But I still feel confident about our overall plan for the year and our ability to monitor and adjust to the customer margins. And look, we still have growth. I mean the electric new customers are as high as they've been since prerecession. The SCE&G gas business hit 2% growth this year in new customers for the first time since 2007 in the housing boom. So we're adding a lot of new customers. And PSNC was similar to North Carolina, about 2% growth. The issue is, I think, just general, folks' general uncertainty with the economy. And is that going to be better in the second half of the year? I don't know. I mean, we've got a lot of discussion that's going to fill up the TV and the Internet. And in the third quarter with Congress bickering over debt ceilings and budgets and tax reform and things of that nature, I'm not sure how that makes folks feel a lot better about their pocketbook.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. I'm try one different way to ask the same question then. If the second quarter trend of slowing growth is continued, you've already announced these cost controls in lower O&Ms. Are there more bullets you could throw at this problem, or if -- or is that kind of it? And at this point, you're hoping for a recovery in sales growth to hit your internal target for the year.","Jimmy E. Addison","We do not need sales growth to \"recover\" to hit any internal targets. We were confident of our plan for the year based on the actions we've taken today, because as our early -- earlier question that asked me, I said really, these cuts that you have made, these attrition and labor retirements, I mean those folks aren't coming back to work. Those cost reductions are there and in place.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- and I hate to be the dead horse here, my apologies. I just want to make sure I understand O&M. When you're talking about O&M, you're talking company-wide, not just SCE&G?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So company wide year-over-year, 3.5% increase from the 2012 GAAP reported nonfuel O&M.","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right, and a little over 2\/3 of the related to those fixed amortizations at SCE&G from the rate case.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And those fixed amortizations, so that's not a cash -- that's a noncash O&M cost?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right. Well, at least, noncash in '13. It was cash at some point in the past and just deferred until the rate proceeding last year.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Since you're moving nuclear capital spending down, why not -- before '13 and '14, why not revise down financing needs?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, as I think I said in the comments, Michael, if I didn't, let me be clearer now. We're constantly monitoring that plan. What you see here in the CapEx shift is our internal estimates, largely. So we need to get these refined from the consortium and have more concrete numbers. And if those warrant shifting to capital plans some, we will. The good news is we're not -- we don't have anything in the immediate headlights that we're about to pull the trigger on that's irreversible. As I said earlier, I don't see us doing anything in the equity markets until the second half of '14 at the earliest. So there's nothing in the near term that says, let's make a decision today that's going to impact '14 or '15 before you get all the information you'd like. I'd rather have more information over the next 6 months and make a better decision.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Completely agree. Last items, and these are both nuclear related. When you think about the move out of the $224 million from the '13 to '15 timeframe, into '16 and beyond, and the potential for some cost inflation up to $200 million, what is that -- which year then becomes the peak CapEx year? It was supposed to be kind of '14, '15-ish timeframe. Does that change, and is the peak year a different year now going forward?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think Slide 10 really is our best estimate today to answer your question. That's where we've estimated the changes. And you can see down at the bottom -- we stick on our corporate-wide CapEx to the 3 years that's in the K. That's why you see '13, '14, '15 presented. But if you look down below, you'll see how we've recapped this for you on June 30 year-end basis related to the project. So you can still see that June of '14, we still project to be the peak capital year, and then it starts to taper down from there.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. I want to make sure, so the blue bar down there, that's the June to June nuclear CapEx?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the data you're showing in the table above, that's the new adjusted nuclear CapEx or...","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right, on a calendar basis. And down below is also adjusted, but on a mid-year basis because that's how the BLRA is driven.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. But neither of which include the potential for any cost increases, whether it's $10 million or $200 million or whatever you guys in the consortium wind up negotiating?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","Jimmy, I was just trying to -- sorry I joined a little bit late coming in from another call. I mean the first half, you did 50% of earnings. And as you've done so well, did you mention that you can be in the top end of the range for the year, or why not?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, I didn't mention that. I did mention, though, in my earlier comments that there were certain items that we had expected to expend in the first half of the year that we were not able to because of the weather. We were specifically, we've trimmed about 300 miles less of right of ways than we had hoped to and planned to at this point during the year and than we had last year, just because it's been so wet in the area. Our rainfall's up 50% above normal just in the first 6 months of the year. So the short of that is we expect some of that to turn around in the latter half of the year, unless we continue to have incredibly high rainfall.","Ashar Khan","But isn't there been higher rainfall, that's what Southern told us, in the whole month of July as well and continuing into August?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, we're only $0.5 billion in August. I wouldn't get too far into predicting August right now, but there has been more into July.","Ashar Khan","Okay, okay. So you don't think -- so you're above plans for the year or no? That's my basic question right now.","Jimmy E. Addison","We still feel confident about our internal target. And we'll reevaluate that as we get through the third quarter. The second quarter's only 15% of our operating plan for the year just because of the cyclical nature of our businesses. So really, you really need to get through to Q3 before we size up where we are and make any tight estimates for the year.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And can we still expect guidance as you've gone back for '14 on the third quarter call?","Jimmy E. Addison","Now, that's our plan.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, thank you very much. And to summarize, we're pleased with the results through midyear. We remain on track to meet our internal target and continue to focus on providing safe and reliable energy, while also staying focused on the execution of the PC summer construction project. I want to thank you, all, for us today, and thank you for your interest in SCANA.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"19164":["SCANA Corporation (NYSE:SCG) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call April 27, 2017  3:00 PM ET","Executives","Iris Griffin - Vice President, Finance","Jimmy Addison - Chief Financial Officer","Steve Byrne - Chief Operating Officer, SCE&G","Analysts","Nick Campanella - UBS","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley","Ashar Khan - Visium","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities","Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi - Castleton Investment Management","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 27, 2017. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Iris Griffin, Vice President of Finance. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Iris Griffin","Thank you and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2017. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA\u2019s homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we post directly to our website maybe deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign up for e-mail alerts under the Investors section of scana.com to notify you when there are new postings in the nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today\u2019s call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found either in the Investors section of our website under Webcast and Presentations or in the slides for this presentation.","I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Iris and thank you all for joining us today. I will begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the first quarter of 2017 were $1.19 per share compared to $1.23 per share in the same quarter of 2016. Increased electric margins primarily from a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth as well as higher gas margins due to customer growth and rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC were more than offset by the impact of significantly milder weather when compared to the same quarter of last year. Additionally, positive variances in O&M and other income were offset by CapEx-related items, including depreciation and property taxes. In the footnote, you will notice that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.24 per share in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016, resulting in a negative $0.19 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter.","Now on Slide 4, I would like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G\u2019s first quarter of 2017 earnings decreased versus the same quarter of 2016 due primarily to the aforementioned significantly milder weather, which was partially offset by increases in electric margins from the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA. Additionally, gas margins at SCE&G increased as a result of a rate increase and customer growth. PSNC\u2019s earnings saw increases versus the same period of the prior year due principally to customer growth and the rate increase. SCANA Energy\u2019s earnings decreased due to significantly milder weather in the first quarter of 2017 versus the same quarter of 2016.","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 5. Through the first quarter of 2017, company\u2019s announced plans to invest approximately $200 million, with the expectation of creating over 1,700 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories. At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of March 2017 and 2016. South Carolina\u2019s unemployment rate is 4.4%. Attesting to our state\u2019s strong economic growth, over 50,000 or 2.5% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia, continue to see stable unemployment rates of 4.9% and 5.1%, respectively. The Carolinas, and especially South Carolina, continue to be seen as a favorable place to do business. As businesses have grown and expanded, they have nearly saturated our state\u2019s workforce, giving way to all-time highs in workforce and employment numbers with little change to unemployment levels. This continued success in turn has been a key factor in our strong customer growth.","On Slide 6, we present customer growth and electric sales statistics. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G\u2019s electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in South Carolina and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.6% respectively. We are pleased to continue to see strong customer growth in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017. Sales were up over the previous 12-month period due to the abnormally hot summer, which offset the recent abnormally mild winter. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis, consistent with our planned expectations.","Please now look to Slide 7, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the box on the right, you will see SCE&G\u2019s base electric business in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2017 and the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher. This mitigates the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. With the approval of our 2015 petition, the allowed ROE was revised down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates, which applied to the requests that went into effect at the end of November 2016. Under the terms of our most recent order, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for prospective requests for revised rates.","As a reminder, we are allowed a return on equity of 9.7% and 10.25% on our gas LDCs in North and South Carolina respectively. As you will recall, in South Carolina, the rates for our gas business are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act. Under that mechanism, the ROE is evaluated annually. If the earned ROE for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside of a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, we file to adjust rates in June, with the updated rates, if approved, becoming effective in November. On the slide, we present the ROE as of December 31, 2016 as we prepare the information as of the end of this quarter for the RSA filing. For this 12-month period, the earned return for SCE&G Gas was 8.47%. In North Carolina, we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for an annual $19 million revenue increase at PSNC Energy, which was effective on November 1, 2016. As of March 31, 2017, the 12-month earned return for PSNC Energy was 9.44%.","Slide 8 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the company\u2019s CapEx projections through 2019 and is consistent with last quarter\u2019s call. This forecast shows projected spending under the fixed price contract and does not include any revisions from our ongoing review of the new nuclear schedule and cost estimates. At the bottom of the slide, we have recapped the estimated new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.","Now please turn to Slide 9 to review our estimated financing plan through 2019. This plan includes the expected impact of the Section 174 income tax deductions as well as debt and equity issuances and is also consistent with last quarter\u2019s call. As a reminder, during the interim transition and evaluation period for the new nuclear project, we are making weekly payments. The projected spend on the project during the interim period is relatively consistent with what has been forecasted in this financing plan. It is unlikely that these debt and equity issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes on our funding needs for planned project expenses. We will update this financing plan and the CapEx plan shown on the prior slide once we complete our evaluation of the path forward for the new nuclear construction project.","On Slide 10, we are reaffirming our 2017 GAAP adjusted weather normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target of $4.25 per share. Our long-term GAAP adjusted weather normalized annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 years to 5 years using a base of 2016\u2019s GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.97 per share.","I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our new nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I would like to start with a training program update. Last week, our maintenance, chemistry, radiological protection and engineering training programs gained initial accreditation from the National Academy for Nuclear Training. This is a multi-year endeavor and a significant achievement for the project. These training programs now join our operator programs which were previously accredited. I would now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 11 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from the first quarter of 2017. From this view, you can gain perspective on the proximity of the units two and three to our operating unit one near the top of the picture. Unit one is currently in a routine maintenance and refueling outage and is on schedule.","Slide 12 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that are located inside the containment vessel. We have placed all of the major CA modules for unit two and have placed CA01, 04 and 05 for unit three. Slide 13 shows an aerial view of the unit two and unit three nuclear islands. The left side of the slide shows unit two. With the addition of the second containment vessel ring in February, you can no longer clearly see all of the large CA structural modules, which as I previously mentioned, have all been placed. Additionally, you can see the shield building and the containment vessel as well as CA20. Unit three is on the right side of the slide. You can see CA01, CA04 and CA05. Outside of the containment vessel, you can also see the CA20 and the shield building beginning to take shape.","Slide 14 shows an example of the installation of a mechanical module. In this case, it is safety related Q223 module being lowered into the unit two containment vessel. This is a direct vessel injection or DVI wall skid, which is a part of the passive core cooling system. Slide 15 shows a picture of the unit three CA02 module inside of the module assembly building or MAB from earlier this year. This module has been completed and is awaiting placement. Slide 16 shows the unit three CA03 module in the MAB, where it is being fabricated. Currently, all 17 sub-modules have been assembled and the last few are being welded together.","Slide 17 shows pictures of the placement of panels that make up the fifth course of the shield building for unit two. As you may recall, these panels are placed, welded together and filled with concrete. We currently have 150 of the 167 panels needed to complete the unit two shield building. Slide 18 shows the progress of the unit three shield building. We have placed, welded and filled the second course of the panels and 82 of the needed 167 panels of unit three shield building are on site.","Slide 19 shows the placement of one of the nine roof trusses for the unit two turbine building. All nine have been installed and you can see in this picture the yellow overhead bridge crane that was placed last quarter and the progress that had been made since then. Slide 20 is a photo of the high pressure turbine lower casing being placed in the unit two turbine building. Each unit has three low pressure and one high pressure turbine. All lower outer casings have been placed for the three low pressure turbines. Final torquing and adjustments are being made before installing the lower inner casings for the low pressure turbines. Slide 21 shows the arrival of one of the two unit three steam generators that were received on-site in March. We now have all four of the steam generators for units two and three. Steam generators transfer heat from the reactor that convert water to steam needed to spin the turbine.","Slide 22, before we open the call for questions from analysts, I would like to provide an update on the ongoing work that has been taking place during the interim transition and evaluation period. This slide outlines some of our options, but any path forward would need to satisfy the growing generation needs of our customers. Our goal is to reach a decision that balances the needs of our customers, our stakeholders and our company. We will continue to provide information and updates whenever possible about the decision.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Nick Campanella","Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Nick Campanella on for Julien.","Jimmy Addison","Hello Nick.","Nick Campanella","Hi, I was curious if we could talk about the frontal guaranteed for a moment, based on where to be triggered, do we have any sense the cadence for those payments, i.e., would it lump-sum or rather spread out over a period of time?","Jimmy Addison","We really don\u2019t yet, that\u2019s yet to be determined. Of course first, we got to determine what the damages would be and then have some discussions around the timing.","Nick Campanella","Thanks. That\u2019s all I have for now.","Jimmy Addison","Okay.","Operator","The next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good afternoon. Thank you. I was wondering if you could update us on the 30-day versus 60-day decision whether or not try to get the 60-day review period?","Steve Byrne","Yes. Travis, this is Steve. We are attempting to extend that interim assessment agreement that we have that expires at 30 days, which I think is tomorrow. As of right now and there is always a lot of last minute details to be taken care of, but we don\u2019t see any impediments at this point to having an agreement in place sometime by either later today or tomorrow.","Travis Miller","Okay. Any idea, would 60 days be enough, would another 30 or would you try another 60 days or\u2026?","Steve Byrne","Yes. I think our goal is to extend it for another 60 days.","Travis Miller","So a total of 90 days then?","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s correct.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then one other question related, the weather impact, how much of that\u2019s either $0.19 year-over-year or $0.24 versus normal, how much of that you get back or will get back through your various clauses that you have?","Jimmy Addison","Really none of that Travis, so that\u2019s just related to the electric business. The weather impact in the two LDCs in the Carolinas is really captured already within the quarter in the accounting. So the cash of it may be a little later but that\u2019s all captured in the accounting, so that $0.24 versus normal is all related to the electric business.","Travis Miller","Okay, very good. I appreciate it.","Operator","The next question will come from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman","Good afternoon. Couple of questions. So, the \u2013 you presented an update to the commission a week or two ago and did talk a little bit about some productivity issues. Now over time, I think there were some issues with people not showing up for training, could you maybe give more color on how that\u2019s going, productivity overall?","Steve Byrne","Yes, productivity is largely unchanged. The issue with folks not showing up for training, that we did see a spike in that the first week that has ameliorated somewhat. So right now, we would typically get, I want to say, 20% of the folks that we would recruit not showing up for training. That\u2019s a fairly normal number. I think we reported that it had spiked to 50%. It\u2019s back down to 30%, so perhaps a bit higher but nothing to be alarmed about any longer. So that\u2019s going well. Fluor is committed to stay on as the construction manager. So, they are still responsible for construction. So, the issue of attracting the craft will go through some bumps in the road with that, but we are pretty confident in Fluor\u2019s ability to staff the project.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And when you say productivity has largely unchanged, is that from when you gave the update two weeks ago or is that from going back to kind of pre-bankruptcy?","Steve Byrne","Yes, if I take a look at this year, I would say it is largely unchanged for the year.","Steve Fleishman","Okay.","Steve Byrne","So if we take a look at March\u2019s numbers, we generally get report outs from the contractor that are lagging by month, so sometime in mid-April, I get March\u2019s number. So in reality, I wouldn\u2019t have a good gauge today as to what the productivity numbers are as they have been impacted by the bankruptcy process or not since bankruptcy was what March 29, I think it was.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then when you gave the update to the Commission and to us before that, you did say that based on the data you had at that time that the cost was within the level of the value to guarantee. Is there any update that you can provide on that?","Steve Byrne","Yes, I think what we said, Steve, was that the estimate from Westinghouse, their estimate to us of what it would cost to complete above what our current fixed price contract amount is would be within the amount that is the parental guarantee from Toshiba. Now whether we recoup that money through the Westinghouse bankruptcy process or through the Toshiba parental guarantee, we are ambivalent to where it comes from. It\u2019s just that we believe that the increase, I think, we have advertised that as about $1.5 billion and the parental guarantee is a little larger than that. So, we feel that right now that based on the numbers we\u2019ve received from Westinghouse that it\u2019s captured. Now what we are doing in this interim assessment period is our own evaluation as to what the duration is going to be and what those costs are going to be. So, we have to assess the commodity\u2019s unit rates. We have to assess how much labor hours are involved in completing the project. So, we are in the middle of that evaluation now and we will come up with our own schedule and our own cost estimate and then we will see how close we were to the Westinghouse estimate.","Steve Fleishman","Okay. And then lastly, just in terms of the site, is everybody basically getting paid through either you or Westinghouse at this point in terms of the contractors?","Steve Byrne","Yes. Now, this is the post-petition amount, so from the time we declared bankruptcy on, the agreement that was struck with the bankruptcy and approved by the bankruptcy court was that we would prepay Westinghouse for those amounts and then Westinghouse would make those disbursements to the vendors and subcontractors which they have the contracts with.","Steve Fleishman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just when you think about the parent guarantee from Toshiba, what is the process if you and Santee Cooper and Toshiba don\u2019t agree on what the amount due under that is? I mean, if you say it\u2019s $2 and Toshiba says it\u2019s $1.50, is there something in the contract that says how that will get resolved whether it\u2019s through a formal arbitration process or some kind of litigation process? We are talking about billions of dollars here, so the potential for one side taking the numbers is different does exist I would believe?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Jimmy. I am sure that, that could be and in fact, it would surprise me if it doesn\u2019t start out that way. But I would say that we have got a pretty good track record of being able to come to reasonable conclusions. And you can just look at how the history of the project over almost a decade now when we have had differences, so not to say that we will at this time, but that would certainly be our approach, but it takes reasonable people on both sides.","Michael Lapides","But is there \u2013 in the contract, is there a formal mediation or arbitration process to hammer out the details or you will have to setup a new process and come do an agreement that way?","Steve Byrne","Yes, Michael, this is Steve. I am not certain because the parental guarantee is actually captured in a separate agreement, because this survives the EPC contract. Certainly, in the EPC contract, we have arbitration and mediation type provisions. I am just not sure as we sit here today if that separate agreement on the parental guarantee contains some kind of a clause. We can look and get back to you on that.","Michael Lapides","That would be great. And then just one question, I mean, every quarter you guys \u2013 and these are great filings and we really appreciate it, the quarterly BLRA filings. I noticed the first 4 to 6 months of 2017 had a host of milestones or target milestones in them, lots of them in the April, May timeframe. Can you just talk about your \u2013 where you sit in terms of kind of hitting a lot of those milestones? Steve, you went through a few of them on the call, but just kind of curious whether you think in general the milestones you\u2019ve provided the commission that you would hit in the first 4 to 6 months of the year? Are there any that are still outstanding whether it\u2019s getting reactor coolant pump equipment onsite or the concrete fill of the nuclear island or some of the others related to the containment vessels?","Steve Byrne","Yes. Michael, there are lot of puts and takes on the schedule and on the milestones. And as you maybe aware, in the last settlement we had with our Public Service Commission, we had agreed that we are going to stop updating the milestones and there really are only two milestones left that we owe the commission and that is completion of the two units. Now that said, we will look at those BLRA milestones and report to the Office of Regulatory Staff on their completion. Of course, they are onsite daily. So, it\u2019s pretty obvious there. From a milestone perspective, I would say that Westinghouse is still lagging behind where they had hoped to be and that\u2019s one of the things that we are going to take a look at going forward as we transition \u2013 if we decide to continue the project, as we transition to an owner-directed model, we will look at removing some of the impediments that Westinghouse is seeing to completing these milestones and getting them done. They do have a number, you are correct, that are due up this quarter and next quarter. So, if we look at the near future, we should set the second of the two-steam generators for Unit 2 in the second quarter. We should set the third ring section on Unit 2, the containment vessel ring section in the third quarter. And we should also set the pressurizer, which is a large component in the reactor cooling system again late second quarter, early third quarter. The shield building courses, they are going very well. So, most of the milestones you see in the second quarter are going to be Unit 2 milestones. Most of the things that we are doing on Unit 3 involve concrete pours as people don\u2019t have a lot of insight into. And so if I report those out that will be very boring to people. So, those generally are not targeted milestones.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you, Steve. Much appreciated. Very helpful.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","Hi. I also had a question related to something in your last status report and that was your comment there related to the I-tax submittal rates and you mentioned those needed to increase significantly. And I was wondering if you could update us on the status of that progress?","Steve Byrne","Yes, we are starting to become more and more comfortable with the I-tax. I think we have got a little under 100 submitted so far. There is 873 per unit, but they are the same, so they are duplicates between unit two and unit three. So the completions, while the rate is not probably up to where we would like to see it, the process is getting smoothed out. So Westinghouse is getting faster and giving the information to us. We are getting a little bit better at turning them around. And then once they get submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it\u2019s a relatively short timeframe before they get them posted in the Federal Register. So that process is going pretty well. We are also working pretty closely with Southern on these, because as you might guess, majority of the I-tax are the same for their units and for our units. It\u2019s just the site-specific stuff that would be different. So the I-tax process in my mind is going better than we had anticipated. That said, there is still by a way of coming that we have tried to prepare the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for and I think they are ready from a staffing perspective to handle those.","Dan Jenkins","Okay, that\u2019s all I have. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions.","Jimmy Addison","Sure, go ahead Steve.","Stephen Byrd","I wanted to just touch on Sanmen in China and just checking with you to see if \u2013 how the status and progress is going at the Sanmen site?","Steve Byrne","Yes. Stephen, this is Steve. We don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t have a latest update on Sanmen. I don\u2019t know that I have got anything beyond what we updated last quarter, which was that they were through their hot functional testing. They had a couple of issues that they had to resolve, which would be normal during a test like that. Once they make the corrections to those issues, some of which are wall trim replacements. They have got some installation that didn\u2019t stand up to high temperatures that they have got to replace. And they have got a heat exchanger issue, I think that we would not have to deal with. But once they get those corrections made, then they will redo that portion of the test and then they would go into fuel load and start up. My understanding is that the first Haiyang unit is also waiting those same corrections. So even though they didn\u2019t get to the point where like the installation melted, they know they have got to change that as well. So they are making the changes on both the Sanmen and the Haiyang unit. So the Haiyang unit won\u2019t finish their hot functional test until after those Sanmen corrections are made. But both \u2013 we anticipate that both units will load fuel this year and start up this year.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, thank you. And then just shifting over to \u2013 I guess I am thinking about Federal support for your project, should we be thinking there is some chance or possibility that there could be some degree of Federal support, whether it will be from the Department of Energy or some other agency in terms of wanting to support base load clean power, is that at least a possibility or should we be thinking that\u2019s relatively unlikely?","Steve Byrne","Well, I think the most objective thing to say about that is they certainly are \u2013 seem to be supportive of trying to get the production tax credit date extended, which is if you think about it that was what those credits originally put out there for us with new projects like this, they know they are going to be challenges and the credits are put out there to entice some to go out and be the first movers. And so just with these delays, it put us close to those deadlines. So that would be the most tangible objective thing that can be done. And I know the Department of Energy understands that very clearly from personal conversations with them recently. And certainly, South Carolina\u2019s delegation does as in both the House and the Senate bills have been introduced to provide for that and with over 20 co-sponsors only to one. So we are hopeful that, that gets traction.","Stephen Byrd","Great. Thank you very much.","Steve Byrne","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium [ph]. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan","Thank you for your time. I just wanted to check in Jimmy, so right we had this tax agreement that you talked about, I thought that helped us to maintain our ROE at the rate that is as I guess somewhat un-great, so couldn\u2019t we have utilized more of those tax credits in this quarter to offset this weather, I am just trying to get a sense of how that works, do you wait till the end of the year to apply those credits or are you using some assumptions throughout the year or could you just walk me through how that works?","Jimmy Addison","Sure. And I think you just about answered your question, which is we really expect to wait over in probably in Q4, so the idea is to use these credits to mitigate each annual BLRA revised rate increase and to use part of it to ensure that the business stays \u2013 the base business stays in a reasonable return of that 9% and 10% in a quarter. As you can see, what we filed there on the \u2013 what we have on the slide there is we estimate it\u2019s a little higher than 9.75%. So it\u2019s still well within that range that we suggest as a reasonable return on the base business and that\u2019s despite some historically mild weather in the first quarter.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So if you want to make some \u2013 those earnings will show off if you want to do something in all that in the fourth quarter then, right, is that correct?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right. And Ashar, it would really \u2013 what we would do is any adjustment we will make would really impact it in the fourth quarter and forward.","Ashar Khan","Fourth quarter and forward, okay, fair point. And then Jimmy, can you give us a little bit sense of \u2013 you highlighted to the commission doing completing both plants, completing one plant and of course, the other option was walking away, I am assuming you are continuing the work on both plants right now, I am just trying to make a sense, did you get some feedback from them or no or anything you can share from the commissioners?","Steve Byrne","Ashar, this is Steve. The update that we gave was an Ex Parte Briefing, so we didn\u2019t really get a feel other than from the questions. It\u2019s clear that the commission is very interested in this and they want to update as soon as we get some more information, which we have committed that we will go back and get to them. But the \u2013 I think they are well aware of \u2013 they sort of view that provisions on abandonment and they know, because we told them that we are going to be evaluating and completing both units, which obviously will be our preference. But from a prudency perspective, we have to evaluate whether or not mothballing one, abandoning one would be in our best interest. Now, from a load perspective, we still have growth in our service territory and we still have a need for the power. So more unlikely we couldn\u2019t just abandon one and then forget about it, we would have to build something else and more unlikely, that would be gas. So we will be evaluating all those scenarios against a gas going forward scenario.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And if I can end up with as this review period is going to get extended, you usually file an update report after every quarter, right, so March, I guess you filed one, which will show up and after 45 days, right, in May 15?","Jimmy Addison","Yes. BLRA quarterly report, that\u2019s correct.","Ashar Khan","So are we going to see any...?","Jimmy Addison","I am sorry our plan is to file that end of next week.","Ashar Khan","End of next week. So Jimmy, are we going to see any new numbers or all those reports are still going to report old numbers, because you are going through this review process, which might take another 60 days, so are we going to get any new data in terms of your filing and your BLRA application which goes in, in May for next year, are we going to get any new data or do we have to really wait for the end of the 60-day period, new 60-day period, which would be, by technicality, end of June?","Jimmy Addison","Yes. So we are going to file the report as we should update what we know at the end of March, but we are not going to have any conclusions of this analysis at that point.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So then really all those reports are basically kind of right, no value, then right, so we have to wait for the conclusion of the analysis to get the real numbers?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say that. I think they have a lot of value in that they point out areas of concern and that kind of thing. We are complying with the regulatory orders, but you have to form your own opinion about the value of them.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Thank you so much. You are so kind.","Jimmy Addison","Certainly.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good afternoon.","Jimmy Addison","Good afternoon Paul.","Paul Patterson","A few quick ones, the \u2013 with Vogtle, there was a DIP financing motion filed by Georgia Power and others regarding intellectual property, have you guys made a similar filling and if not, why not?","Steve Byrne","We have not made a similar finding and the reason is that we have escrowed intellectual property, so we have access to intellectual property. I think the Vogtle concern was that some of the perhaps filing a lien or that person providing that line of credit or the credit funds for Westinghouse might decide to try to take title to the intellectual property as well as some of the real property. So we don\u2019t have the same issue.","Paul Patterson","Okay, great. And then with respect to the 60-day extension on the evaluation, was that \u2013 what caused that, is that because you guys have gotten more of a sense of the \u2013 of what you guys have to do now after the first 30 days or was it kind of always what was contemplated or sort of \u2013 what\u2019s causing, I guess the extension of the evaluation period?","Jimmy Addison","Yes. I will tell you, Paul that we had always looked at a longer period than 30 days to do the evaluation. But going back to when we were putting this in place, a very, very short timeframe leading up to an impending bankruptcy. And we want to get everything prepackaged such that it could be filed easily with the bankruptcy court and that made coordination not just between ourselves and Westinghouse, but also Southern Company. So we got that finished. Going forward however, there is \u2013 we don\u2019t view there to be necessarily a link between a Southern agreement and our agreement so that we can really do our own thing in the next 60-day period. So we had sort of a vision a 60-day to 90-day period all along, but we had to get the thing done initially in order to get the time \u2013 filing timeframe for this bankruptcy proceeding. So that 30 days was the agreed upon amount, so we are doing exactly what we anticipated we would do.","Paul Patterson","Okay, that makes sense. And then finally, just the safe harbor, it did \u2013 I did note that there seem to be a mention, which I hadn\u2019t seen before about new joint owners, possible joint owners, with respect to the plants. And is there \u2013 I guess, what was the reason for the cause of putting that in there, is there any potential for new owners?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I just think as we go through this evaluation, I don\u2019t know how significant a risk is, but there is some risk that the two current partners in the arrangement could end up at different evaluations of the different options that Steve outlined earlier. So again, not putting any \u2013 not suggesting that will happen, but it\u2019s just cautionary.","Paul Patterson","Okay, thanks so much. I appreciate it.","Jimmy Addison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And the next question will come from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Neil Kalton","Hi guys. On the tax credit extensions that you are looking for, any sense as to how fast those bills might progress through Congress. And then also how important are the PTCs for you to really move forward with this project, would you move forward if you didn\u2019t have clarity?","Jimmy Addison","Neil, it\u2019s Jimmy. So there is at least three different routes as how they might move through. There is \u2013 in the very near-term, there is going to be in the next week or two weeks, likely a continuing resolution to continue to fund the Federal government. There is some possibility that they are a part of that. If not, there is a possibility that they are part of a more comprehensive tax reform. And then a third channel at least is just the bills get introduced on the floor standalone, so any of those three might happen. And then as far as your question about criticality, I mean there is three large influencers over the viability of these projects. One is the validation of the estimated cost. The second is the recovery of the response of \u2013 financial responsibility from Westinghouse\/Toshiba. And then third are these tax credits. And all three of those are in the billions of dollars, so they are all critically important. And we have impressed upon everyone that has a vested interest in South Carolina and in nuclear and in America that listen to us that the timeliness of this is very, very important to this evaluation. So I can\u2019t say absolutely that absent those, part or all of the unit would go forward. But it is very, very, important to the viability.","Neil Kalton","Right. Thank you.","Jimmy Addison","Certainly.","Operator","The next question will come from Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi of Castleton Investment Management. Please go ahead.","Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi","Hi guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.","Jimmy Addison","Sure.","Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi","I just had a follow-up on Ashar\u2019s question, my understanding of the rate background rider was not that it provided incremental earnings, I think you are saying that it could be used to offset weather, but rather that it would be used as a credit to rate base, which would in turn increase your earned ROE, all things considered, so can you just walk through that, would it give you incremental earnings in the fourth quarter or is it just lower your rate base, so your earned ROE looks optically higher?","Jimmy Addison","No, it\u2019s the latter. It just affects the lower rate base, so the ROE is higher.","Stephen D\u2019Ambrisi","Okay, alright. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks very much guys.","Jimmy Addison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well, thank you.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our Analyst Call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2015. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other Investor Relations information directly to our Web site at scana.com.

You can sign up for e-mail alerts under the investor relations section of scana.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and or other investor information section of the Web site.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information can be found in the investor relations section of our Web site under Web casts and presentations. ","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan. And thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $2.80 per share compared to $1.37 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the first quarter are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, and higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth. Also O&M presented a favorable variance, which is primarily attributable to CGT only operating as part of the SCANA family for one month.","These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather, lower gas margins and expected increases in CapEx-related items, including interest, property taxes, and share dilution. Note that even though weather had a negative impact on earnings year over year, it was still abnormally cold and earnings increased by $0.05 per share in the first quarter 2015 compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2014.","Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the first quarter of 2015 were $1.34 per share compared to $1.27 per share in the same quarter of 2014. This excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI in the first quarter of 2015 of $1.41 per share.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's first-quarter 2015 earnings were relatively flat when compared to the same quarter of 2014. However, exclusive of the previously mentioned impacts of weather, earnings per share were up $0.05 in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014. Increases in earnings were due primarily to the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, customer growth, and a decrease in operation and maintenance expenses. ","These items were offset by a decrease in gas margins, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense, property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. PSNC Energy's earnings were $0.24 per share for the first quarter of 2015, consistent with the prior year. SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed an increase in first quarter earnings of $0.03 per share in 2015 over last year. This improvement was primarily attributable to increased margins. On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $1.48 per share in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $0.08 per share in the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, GAAP-adjusted EPS was down $0.01 over the prior year. This is mainly attributable to lower interest expense at the Holding Company being more than offset by the foregone earnings contribution from the subsidiaries that were sold. I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory, on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over $600 million with the expectation of creating over 1,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories. Most significantly, Mercedes Benz announced plans last month to invest about $500 million to build a new commercial van assembly plant in Charleston, creating approximately 1,300 jobs. South Carolina continues to be seen as a favorable place to start and\/or expand existing businesses. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G Electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.7% and the rate in SCE&G's Electric territory, is estimated at 5.6%.","While the South Carolina unemployment rate has slightly increased over the past few quarters, March marked the 64th consecutive month of employment growth and the 14th consecutive month of labor force expansion, as the number of people entering the workforce is at an all-time high. Approximately 50,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Slide 7 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slides are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.6% and 2.9%, respectively. Of particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated over rates a year ago. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended March 31, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were flat on a 12 month ended basis. We continue to see slightly lower weather normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies, which are offset by increases in industrial demand.","Now please turn to Slide 8 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31 in the base electric business is approximately 9.6%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business we're allowed an 11% return on equity. Last year the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $561 million to our rate base, and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new revised request for rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively. And we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reflected in the petition filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12, 2015. At the bottom of the slide we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. As a reminder, in January we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401(k) and DRIP plans before turning the plans off to new shares. By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plans, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and currently expect we could satisfy future needs without follow-on offerings. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented, as they are subject to changes in funding needs for the planned project expenses. And we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Finally, on slide 11, we are reaffirming our GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share, along with our internal target of $3.70 per share. Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next three to five years using a base of 2014's GAAP-adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. ","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to slide 12. I'd like to begin by discussing the petition that SCE&G filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on March 12. The petition is seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. The construction schedule, without consideration of all mitigating strategies, includes a substantial completion date of June of 2019 for Unit 2, and June of 2020 for Unit 3. The new capital cost schedule includes incremental capital costs that total $698 million, of which $539 million are associated with the delay and other contestant costs. As previously noted, negotiations continue with the Consortium and neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted responsibility for any contested and or delay-associated costs. Further, we cannot predict when these negotiations will be resolved.","I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 13 presents an aerial photo of the site from last December. Here, you can see the layout of the site.","I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up the construction table top. The site changes daily, and for those of you that have been tracking the project for some time, you can see that progress continues to take place.","On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture you can see module CA20 along with containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. Also visible in this photo are the personnel and equipment hatches which are located in the first ring section. Work continues on the containment vessel prepared for placement of CA01, which we will discuss shortly. Progress continues on achieving what we term elevation 100, as auxiliary building walls are being built up. Once elevation 100 has been reached, work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for the plant, as well as placing of the shield building panels.","Slide 15 presents a schematic of the large structural modules that will be located inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA01, 02, 03, and 05, which we will further discuss shortly.","Slide 16 is another schematic view of the modules inside of the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA01 through 05 gives you a better feel of how they fit spatially inside said containment vessel.","Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA01. CA01 houses the steam generators, the","pressurizer, and forms a refueling canal inside of the containment vessel. On the right-hand side of the photo you can see an arc flash from the automatic process that's seam welding the sub-modules together. This seam welding on all sub-modules in preparation for lifting has been completed in the module assembly building or MAB. Once support concrete has been placed and","cured, the CA01 module will be moved outside of the MAB, rigged to the heavy lift derrick and set in the Unit 2 containment vessel. After the placement of CA01 for Unit 2, the next module to be placed will be module CA02. ","Slide 18 shows a picture of CA02 as it is currently being fabricated. We now have all five sub-modules on site with three standing upright for assembly in the MAB. Module CA02 has a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling water storage tank located inside that containment vessel.","Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. The containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and the auxiliary building walls continue to take form. On the left side of slide 20, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. And I've added an arrow showing where the construction is taking place for the turbine pedestal. On the right, you can see a picture from the top of the turbine building of the turbine pedestal. The turbine pedestal will be concrete 10 feet thick, and will support the Unit 2 turbine when completed.","Slide 21 shows some of the shield building panels that have arrived on site for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create the shield building. On the left, you can see one of these panels up close. On the right, you can see the lay-down yard where we have been receiving these panels. We currently have received about 60 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that were manufactured by Newport News Industries.","On Slide 22, you can see where we have begun assembly of the shield building panels. Once joined and welded together, panel sections will be placed starting at elevation 100. ","On Slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of the construction. This chart reflects our company's current, actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020; reflecting petition filed March 12 with the Public Service Commission. As you can see, the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA, and is associated with the right hand axis. Please now turn to slide 24. We have two BLRA filings coming up in May. In mid May we will file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And as mentioned earlier, on May 29 we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. ","Finally, please turn to slide 25 to briefly discuss our solar initiative in South Carolina. Our customers and other South Carolina stakeholders have expressed a desire for solar energy, and we've been looking for ways to economically integrate additional solar into our generation portfolio. As a part of the Distributed Energy Resource Program, which was filed with the Public Service Commission in February, SCE&G plans to add approximately 95 megawatts of renewable energy by the end of 2020. In 2015, we plan to install approximately 10 megawatts of solar generation to our system. As you can see from the slide, the first two solar farms will be a 3.8-megawatt solar farm in Cayce, South Carolina, adjacent to our corporate headquarters, and a 500-kilowatt solar farm that will be constructed in North Charleston, South Carolina. That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] The first question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller","Good afternoon, thank you. I'm going back to the previous CapEx estimate for the 2015, 2017 from the previous quarter. Looks like the delta there is about a $250 million or so on the new nuclear?","Jimmy Addison ","Right.","Travis Miller","Is that part of that $698 million such that the balance of the $698 million would be post 2017? Am I getting that timing right there?","Jimmy Addison","That's correct.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then how much cash did you get from the CGT and SCI sales that could go into offsetting that equity?","Jimmy Addison ","It was a little over $425 million, Travis.","Travis Miller","And now, like you said, you plan to use as an equity investment to fund the CapEx?","Jimmy Addison ","Right, over time. It will take us the next couple of years to fully utilize that through displacing otherwise planned equity.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Weinstein of UBS.","Michael Weinstein","Just wondering if you could give us any update or color on how the negotiations are going with the Consortium?","Steve Byrne ","Michael, this is Steve. I think the only color I can put around it is they are ongoing. The positive aspects are they haven't completely broken down yet. And we always would reserve the right or the opportunity for other dispute resolutions down the road, whether that be arbitration or litigation. But as of right now, we're still in the discussion phase with the Consortium. Obviously arranging schedules with our executives has been challenging, but we haven't given up on the negotiation discussions. And we feel that there's an opportunity for a settlement in the future.","Michael Weinstein","If there is no settlement, what is the other alternative? Is it litigation?","Steve Byrne ","The contract has in it a variety of dispute resolution provisions. Arbitration is one of those, but litigation would be the ultimate one.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. I was wondering if you could go over a little bit more about your strategic plan for solar. How much rate base potential is there going forward? Are there new initiatives, new legislative initiatives, that might expand that even further? Are you going to be going outside of the state at all, expand beyond your borders?","Steve Byrne ","Michael, this is Steve again. As of right now, the legislation in South Carolina is through Act 236 and that will be restricted to the state. Our current plans do not take us outside of the state borders. As of right now what we're looking at is -- it works out to be like 2% of peak load, and so that works out to somewhere in the 50-megawatt range of industrial-scale solar. And roughly 50 megawatts of nonindustrial or residential commercial scale solar. So that's what our goals are from between now and about 2020. What we've outlined here are the first of the projects that we have planned. Now, whether we own those up front or not will be a question, and right now we're not thinking that we will own those necessarily up front. Other entities can take advantage of things like tax credits that we are not able to take advantage of. I think eventually we will probably own them. We also have about 300 or so customers on our system right now with solar, all relatively small commercial and residential scale, in addition to about a 2.3-megawatt facility we have down at Boeing . Now we do anticipate that we'll end up with somewhere in the range of 5,000 commercial and residential customers after 2020 through this state-approved program.","Michael Weinstein ","And when you say that eventually you think you'll own them, you mean after the five-year period after the ITC?","Steve Byrne","Yes, I think so. We'll have to see how the tax legislation plays out, but that's our current thinking anyway.","Operator","The next question comes from Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Good afternoon, guys.","Jimmy Addison","Hello, Jim.","Jim von Riesemann","How are you?","Jimmy Addison","Great, how are you?","Jim von Riesemann","I'm okay. I've got three questions, if you don't mind, so one question three parts. First one is, your trailing 12-month earnings on a weather-normalized basis of $3.62. How do you get to the midpoint of your range of $3.60 to $3.70, so you guys hit your $3.70 target?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, $3.60 to $3.80 with a $3.70 target, right. So the way we get there is through customer growth and through the growth in rate base, which is driving the BLRA increases. So those are the two main contributors.","Jim von Riesemann","Can you explain it's okay thank you. Second question is can you explain why the nuclear rate base has stayed flat for the last three consecutive quarters at $2.667 billion? I'm looking at your pie chart on page 8.","Jimmy Addison","No, I can't off the cuff, Jim. That doesn't sound rational. I'll have to check on that and follow-up.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And then my last question is, with this petition that you're supposed to put in later this month and at the end of the month, will you ask specifically for the special petition and then normal the BLRA filing to be consolidated? Or is that something that the regulators will have to do? And part B of that question, is that a function of the status in negotiations?","Steve Byrne ","Jim, this is Steve. The two proceedings before the Commission will stay separate. Remember that what we file for in May is a trailing 12-month, so it's what we've actually spent and really does not have anything to do with what we're proposing going forward. In large measure, what we're asking for with the update petition, and again we expect a hearing in the July time frame and an order in the September time frame, will be on forward-looking. So that's money we","haven't yet spent. But it's our best projection to date as to what we will end up spending on the project. So those two will stay distinct and separate.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And then I guess the last question is related to PTCs and what you might think might happen with nuclear PTCs. I know you're coming up against the time clock and I noticed today that DTE press release was a little bit skittish, but they're putting in for a new nuclear plant. Is that part of the PTCs network? Would that take away from the PTCs that you guys have applied for?","Jimmy Addison","I think DTE applied for a combined operating license for another nuclear facility some time ago. And I think the press release today is around successful culmination of that process for them.","They will not qualify for production tax credits, because you had to have your license issued by a date certain. We're past that date certain, so that will not change the production tax credit basis for us. We believe that, I think it was outlined in our filings, that we will actually be qualifying for more production tax credits than we had originally anticipated in our original filing. So that's a positive aspect. We fully anticipate that the Consortium will be able to bring the plants in by June of 2019, and June of 2020 for the second unit. So the production tax credits, you qualify for them by having the plan in service before the end of 2020. So while I'm not satisfied with only having about six months' margin, we do believe that there are some opportunities, particularly on that trailing unit, or Unit 3 for us, to bring that in a little bit earlier.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys, congrats on a good quarter. A couple of nuts and bolts questions. Jimmy, can you give a little more clarity about what happened year over year in O&M? Was it at one of the utilities? Or was it just losing the O&M related to the businesses you sold?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, well there's a little fluctuation in all of the business. There have been pay increases earlier in the year for the employee base across all of the businesses, et cetera, some minor inflationary increases with outside vendors. But the most significant change would be the two months of CGT O&M not being in there. That's the most significant one.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And also, when you look at O&M for the year relative to last year at both SCE&G and","PSCNC, what are you expecting in terms of growth or kind of growth rates?","Jimmy Addison","If you look at it on the face of the financials with the GAAP O&M as reported last year to include the two businesses we've sold, we would expect them to be down for the face of the financials of 2015 compared to 2014, in the 1% to 2% range, because you don't have the O&M for those two businesses for the majority of 2015. If you strip those out from the prior year related to those two small businesses, then we would expect it to be up maybe 1%, something like that, but fairly close to flat. Apples to apples.","Michael Lapides ","Got it. So traditional utility O&M, flat to up 1%?","Jimmy Addison ","Yes, that's our expectation.","Michael Weinstein","Understood. Last question, just real quick. When do you think -- I know you're trying to avoid it -- when do you think you'll have to come in on either the SCE&G gas or electric side? Maybe looking more a little bit at the gas side, given the earned ROE there is a little lower than what it is on the electric?","Jimmy Addison ","On the electric side, our strategy continues to be to do everything we can possibly do to stay out of a base rate increase, other than the BLRA increases each year, during these peak nuclear construction years. So that hasn't changed, and we've defined our internal goal of staying above a 9% return to be able to achieve that. On the gas side, we've got the Rate Stabilization Act in South Carolina which measures it each year, so at the end of the heating season, at the end of the first quarter. And of course the numbers we disclosed there for the gas business were at 12\/31. But once they settle out that and make the pro forma adjustments, the Office of Regulatory Staff will review it. And if it's more than 50 basis points either way off of the 10.25% allowed return, there will be a recommendation to the Public Service Commission that rates be adjusted. For example, last year, we were above the allowed return by more than 50 basis points, so there was a small rate decrease of ballpark $3 million. And that same measurement will happen this year.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. One other item, real quick. SCANA Energy. Anything unusual on the positive side in the quarter? Or is this more of a return to normal and last year was a bit of abnormal?","Jimmy Addison ","Well, the main difference is in 2014 we worked very hard to work on the costs of our storage gas that's there. With the weather that had been there the last few years and the embedded price of that, we weren't able to use a lot of that storage to fully respond to the current market price. And we were able to move through a lot of that higher-cost gas in 2014. That's put us in a better position to use that storage to be able to compete in 2015. So we're in a much better position now.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett.","Mitchell Moss ","Hey, guys. I just wanted to get your views on the importance of being investment-grade at all three rating agencies for your Holding Company, for SCANA Hold Co. And particularly having an investment grade rating at Moody's.","Jimmy Addison ","Well, it's critically important at the Operating Company, where we expect to issue a substantial amount of debt the next few years. Most of the organizations have a linking methodology, so that they are going to ratchet down the HoldCo slightly less. It's clear that, especially with the extended period of construction for the new nuclear plants, that it's going to be difficult on some of the metrics to maintain some of the current ratings at the Operating Companies. And that's likely going to put more pressure on those. If those were to change, then by methodology it's probable that the HoldCo ratings could change as well. So it's possible those could slip slightly below investment-grade at the HoldCo, but we expect that the OpCo would be able to maintain the investment-grade ratings.","Mitchell Moss ","So in other words, you don't see any need to be investment-grade at the Holding Company?","Jimmy Addison","I wouldn't say we don't see any need to. It's a matter of juggling everything we have to juggle, and running the Operating Company at reasonable equity levels that the regulators will endorse. There's only so much we can do with that. The real strain on the metrics is the longer -- although the BLRA is a very effective mechanism, all it allows us to do is to recover the financing costs during the construction period. We're not recovering the actual construction cost of the plants until they start depreciation. That's when we get the recovery of the actual cost of the plants. So the longer that period is drawn out with increased cost of the plants, it's going to put more pressure on the cash flow ratio. So I wouldn't say we don't think it's important. It just may be very, very difficult to do with juggling all of the factors we have to juggle.","Mitchell Moss ","So in other words, when Moody's has discussed that FFO to debt needs to improve above 13%, and RCF needs to improve above 8% or 9%, you don't see that likely happening over the next two years, based on how the BLRA recoveries are designed. Is that effectively what you're saying?","Jimmy Addison ","It's going to be a challenge, that's fair.","Operator","The next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andy Levi","Hi, good afternoon. I actually wasn't going to ask a question, but just interesting, the last question, so back to the question for me. Just to understand because SCANA Corp's BBB. So obviously you wouldn't defend that BBB rating, is that what you're saying if need be?","Jimmy Addison","I don't understand what.","Andy Levi ","I don't mean defend it verbally, I mean defend it financially. So if the BBB rating at SCANA Corp was in jeopardy, you wouldn't issue equity or come up with some equity to defend that BBB?","Jimmy Addison","We would have to look at the situation as we get there. But in the short run here, we've strengthened the balance sheet a great deal in one quarter with the $400 million-plus of cash we brought in. So it's significantly stronger today than it was 90 days ago. What we've got to do is move through the project, see how these negotiations go, see what the schedule looks like, and respond dynamically during the situation. But I can't say that in every case, we would issue additional equity just to keep that bond rating at investment-grade at the HoldCo.","Andy Levi","Okay. And just to understand, because I guess I had a different impression. Maybe I'm just misinterpreting, but the sale of the pipe, was that to defend the rating? Or was that done because it made the most economic sense? Or a combination of the two?","Jimmy Addison","It was actually done for strategic focus on our retail businesses. The by-product was what I was","mentioning earlier, in the short run here has strengthened the balance sheet substantially. But it was really about focusing on retail business, which is core at what we do. So everything that's left in the portfolio is about being focused on those retail businesses in these three states.","Andy Levi","Okay I'll discuss it with you next time I meet with you. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Winter of Gabelli & Company. please go ahead.","Tim Winter","Good afternoon, guys. I was wondering if you could update us on the development of the Sanmen units over in China. What the target completion dates are there and if there's any issues that we should be aware of as it relates to summer.","Steve Byrne","Tim, this is Steve again. I can only give you what our understanding is of the schedule at Sanmen. I can't speak for Sanmen, either the utility, the construction company or even Westinghouse. But our understanding is that they have made good progress, the plant physically looks like a complete plant. They would plan to go into production or be operational at the end of 2016. So they continue to be about two and a half years ahead of us and they are making good progress. The latest holdups for them, the reactor coolant pumps are probably two-thirds to three-quarters of the way through an extended engineering and endurance run, with no problems noted to date. So with that behind them, that should allow them to get into high drilling the primary side or the reactor cooling system side, which they hope to get to late this year. But I believe they've made very good progress there. I know they've been into flushing the secondary side of the plant, or the turbine building side. I think they've started the flush of the primary side of the plant, or the reactor side. We're heartened by good progress there. And our team will be making another trip to China, I guess in next week. So we'll be visiting China next week with a team that includes some members of SCE&G and Santee Cooper.","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Jenkins of the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","I just wanted to make sure that I understand correctly. I'm looking at your Exhibit 1 that you filed in March, related to the construction schedule at the nuclear plant, along with your slide 16. Just want to make sure I understand kind of the order here. So CA04 is already set, right? And then is the next thing going to be CA03 followed by CA01 and CA02? Am I looking at that properly?","Steve Byrne","We have set CA04. We've also set CA05. And then not inside of the containment vessel itself, but just outside forming most of the auxiliary building, is a module called CA20, which we set.","So the CA01 is actually being fabricated. The weld-out is finished to the point where we could lift it. So we're just waiting for some concrete to be prepped and poured and cured inside of that containment vessel to set CA01. And then after 01, I think it's 02. So 03 is actually one of the later ones to set.","Dan Jenkins","So CA01, CA02 and then CA03?","Steve Byrne","Right, 04 and 05 are already set.","Dan Jenkins","Right. And then are those critical paths so that 02 can't go in until after 01 has been set? And 03 can't go in until after 01 and 02? Is that true or not?","Steve Byrne ","Yes, Dan, there is a definite sequence to it and 01 has to be next.","Dan Jenkins","Okay.","Steve Byrne ","One is also constraining the lift of the second containment vessel ring section, just because of the height of that module.","Dan Jenkins","Okay, that's the only question I had, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from David Paz from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. ","David Paz ","A question, is the settlement with the ORS and other parties in your pending new nuclear petition, possible absent a resolution with the Consortium on the costs and schedule?","Jimmy Addison ","Dave, I think we're certainly going to pursue that option, because right now we don't know when the negotiations might be concluded with the Consortium. We are going to pursue that with the Office of Regulatory Staff and other interveners to be settled, as in enter into a settlement agreement prior to the conclusion of the negotiations. Now, if the negotiations take a very positive turn and they're concluded, obviously that will impact how we proceed. But as of right now we're proceeding assuming that we will not have a settlement of the negotiations. And we'll be pursuing a settlement agreement with the Office of Regulatory Staff.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho.","Jim von Riesemann ","Hi there again, sorry about this. I'm just listening to the call. I'm getting a little confused, maybe you can help me out. So what's more important for SCE&G, is my question. Is it fixing the variable component, cost component of the contract? Or is it having the plants come online ahead of the construction timeline that the Consortium has proposed?","Steve Byrne ","Jim, I'm not sure that I would say either is necessarily more important than the other. We believe that getting the costs right is very important, but it's also critical to us to have the plants come online no later than when the Consortium says they can deliver them to us, which, from our perspective, is already late. So I don't know that I would say one is necessarily more important than the other.","Jim von Riesemann ","Okay, I'll follow-up off-line with you, thank you.","Steve Byrne ","Thanks.","Jimmy Addison ","Jim, let me follow-up on your earlier question that I did not know the answer to at the time, about why the $2.667 billion on the chart number eight hasn't changed. That chart reflects the amount of NND CapEx that's included in rates, in cash rates. So as we don't get new rates except once a year, the additional CWIP that's been incurred since the middle of 2014 that's earning AFUDC is not included in that chart.","Jim von Riesemann ","That's right, I should have known that. Sorry for asking that question.","Jimmy Addison ","I should have known too, sorry.","Operator","We have a follow-up from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Hey, guys. Heard all of the commentary regarding the Holding Company credit rating. Just want to make sure, and I may have missed this. Have you guys either gotten commentary from the rating agencies but been put on some kind of watch? Have they made any proactive steps that would result in a downward change to the rating? And can you talk about if any covenant issues that would create or any cross entity-related issues something like that would create? Or even if it would have a material impact on your cost to borrow it?","Jimmy Addison ","Yes, Michael, at the HoldCo, we've had negative outlook with S&P and Fitch at BBB and BBB+. So there's room for a notch or two, respectively, in both of those and still remain investment-grade, obviously. And we're currently stable at Moody's. The only thing I was mentioning is that some of them, and frankly I don't remember which one right now, have -- and maybe most all of them even -- have these methodologies so that if the OpCo moves, the","HoldCo has to move by methodology, by definition. We don't have anything other than that.","I think they're all watching the outcome for the HoldCo just like they are on the OpCo of this very, very important filing before the PSC and BLRA update. So I think that is the key issue. Not aware of any covenant issue or anything like that would cause any additional concerns.","Michael Lapides ","But what about cost to borrow? Meaning, how do you think about what it does to either short-term debt or borrowing costs in general? You've got a lot of capital to spend. You've got a lot of debt coming to help fund that capital.","Jimmy Addison ","We do, and this whole conversation has been about the HoldCo debt. We don't have any additional new debt that we plan to issue at the HoldCo. I think there's maybe $500 million that would need to be refinanced at some point out 2019, 2020. That's well beyond the critical period where these ratios are going to be stressed. So we don't expect any incremental impact on borrowing costs at the HoldCo because, frankly, we don't plan to do anything for the next four to five years there.","Michael Lapides ","Got it. Thank you, Jimmy, much appreciated.","Jimmy Addison ","You're welcome. I appreciate the clarifying question.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison, Executive Vice President and CFO, for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison ","Thank you, Andrew. The first quarter of 2015 has certainly been an eventful one from the successful closings of the sales of the two subsidiaries, to the petition filed with the PSC seeking approval of schedule and cost changes to our new nuclear project.

I apologize for the technical issues and delay experienced earlier. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 30, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that further contains a link to project news and updates. In connection with this process, we have discontinued our practice of furnishing on Form 8-K the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports on the SCANA website.","Please note that we have recently added an other investment information link to the yellow box. The new other investor information section of the website contains a link to recent investor-related information that cannot be found at other areas of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that is not otherwise become public.","In addition, I want to remind you that you can sign up under the Investor Relations section of scana.com for e-mail alerts for financial reports and press releases.

The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3.","Basic earnings in the third quarter of 2014 were $1.01 per share compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Please note that the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the company's financial results are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.","Accordingly, the improved results in the third quarter are attributable to increases in electric margins due to abnormal weather, continued recovery of financing costs through the Base Load Review Act or BLRA and customer growth. We estimate the impact of abnormal weather added $0.07 per share in electric margins for the quarter. These increases were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including property taxes, depreciation, interest expense and share dilution.","Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2014, were $3.06 per share versus $2.67 in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. We estimate abnormal weather added $0.23 per share to electric margins on a year-to-date basis.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter 2014 earnings denoted in blue were up $0.11 compared to 2013. This was driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to abnormal weather, continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses as well as expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.39 due primarily to higher electric and gas margins.","PSNC Energy shown in red reported a seasonal loss of $0.02 for the third quarter of 2014 compared to a loss of $0.03 for the same quarter of 2013. For the 9-month period ended September 30, 2014, basic earnings were up $0.02 per share over the same period of 2013.","SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, reported a seasonal loss for the third quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.03 for the third quarter of 2013. Year-to-date earnings were $0.11 per share, consistent with the prior year.","SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported the loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2014 compared to flat earnings for the third quarter of the prior year. This is primarily the result of lower margin in the Energy Marketing business and higher interest expense at the holding company. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings of $0.02 in 2014 compared to $0.04 in 2013.","I'd like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $630 million, with expectations of creating over 6,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories.","Obviously, one of the largest economic development activities currently ongoing in the state of South Carolina is the building of 2 new nuclear units at V.C. Summer station. The construction workforce now numbers over 3,000, along with the addition of over 500 full-time employees hired directly by SCE&G to begin preparation to operate the plants once construction is complete.","To meet the demands for these new nuclear workforce, programs have been created at various colleges and universities, creating further economic expansion. The majority of contract employees are from the state of South Carolina or from the region. So the project is significantly impacting the local and state economy. Its operation will enable South Carolina to support continued economic growth, while producing clean, efficient energy for decades to come.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with rates for 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.6%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 6.1%. Impacting the state's unemployment rate is the introduction of approximately 17,000 people to the workforce since last quarter. However, the employment outlook still remains positive as over 21,000 South Carolinians have found work and the state unemployment rate has dropped by 7\/10 of a point since September of 2013.","Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric rates. On the top of the slide, our customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.3%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an identical 2.5% rate.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized, total retail sales were up 7\/10 of a percent on a 12 months ended basis driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continued to see slightly lower weather-normalized consumption at the residential level, reflecting anticipated efficiencies.","Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.8 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30 in the electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. The Public Service Commission of South Carolina recently approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $561 million to our rate base. And we will implement a rate increase in November of approximately 2.8%.","Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.","SCE&G's gas business returns are measured each year through the rate stabilization act. We recently received approval for a small decrease effective with the first billing cycle in November, which equates to a $2.6 million reduction on an annual basis.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed in August and does not include any additional cost or scheduled delays estimated by the Consortium as we are in the midst of the negotiation process at this time. At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes and funding needs for planned project expenses. On May 27 of this year, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we've issued approximately $75 million from our 401(k) matching and DRIP plans and continue to target 52% to 54% equity levels at the operating company, SCE&G. However, based upon cash flows and the planned construction payments to date, we have pushed $100 million of additional equity issuances from 2014 to 2015 to meet our targeted cap structure, as I suggested was a possibility on our previous call. We currently estimate we will not require any of this deferred equity until the latter half of 2015.","Similarly, we are deferring the planned $300 million debt issuance from Q4 2014 to Q1 2015. Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously, the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower-than-anticipated escalation as well.","The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings.","We're very pleased to report that earlier this month, we successfully extended our largest credit facility by 1 year. The facility totaled $1.6 billion and covers 5 years, and now will expire in October of 2019. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction. We also have an additional $200 million for peak construction liquidity at SCE&G, which will expire in October 2016.","I would like to thank our banks for their support of our liquidity needs and therefore, our nuclear project.","Now on Slide 11. Remaining unchanged is our long-term outlook of 3% to 6% growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on the 2013 weather-normalized base of $3.40 of basic earnings per share. We're adjusting our guidance for 2014 to reflect our results to date through the third quarter. Our previous range of $3.45 to $3.65 is adjusted to $3.70 to $3.90. This reflects the $0.23 of weather experienced year-to-date in the electric business and the expectation of normal weather in Q4.","We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 32%.","And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. I want to begin by discussing the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule on cost information we received from the Consortium. As previously discussed, the Consortium began a full free baselining of V.C. Summer Unit 2 and Unit 3 construction schedules to incorporate project delays associated with engineering completion, construction lessons learned and component procurement and fabrication. In August, we received preliminary information relative to this rebaselining in which the Consortium indicated that the substantial completion of Unit 2 is expected to occur in late 2018 or the first half of 2019 and that the substantial completion of Unit 3 would be approximately 12 months later.","As indicated in our website, in the new nuclear deployment or NND yellow box update, the Consortium has provided preliminary EPC cost estimates, principally related to these delays to achieve the late 2018 substantial completion date for Unit 2. SCE&G's 55% portion of this preliminary estimate has approximately $660 million, which is in 2007 dollars and would be subject to escalation.","It also excludes any owner's cost amounts associated with the delays. The $200 million that we referred to in previous disclosures starting at our June 2013 Annual Analyst Meeting regarding potential cost increases associated with prior schedule delays included escalations on owner's costs. So excluding the amounts attributable to those items, the balance of the $200 million is included in the $660 million and would not be an addition to it.","The EPC costs fall roughly into 3 buckets: fixed; firm; or target costs. The target costs are impacted by changes in the construction schedule as major -- a major component of this bucket is labor. Other non-EPC cost components impacted by the delays in the construction schedule and not included in the $660 million estimate are owner's costs and escalation costs. It is too early to determine owner's costs as we are in the midst of negotiation processing with the Consortium. while the preliminary schedule on cost estimates are under review by SCE&G in Santee Cooper and it is anticipated that further study evaluation and negations associations will occur, we cannot predict when the revised schedule on cost estimates will be finalized.","The preliminary cost estimates and preliminary substantial completion dates do not reflect consideration of the liquidated damages provision of the EPC contract, which would partly mitigate any such delays. They also do not reflect all of the possible efforts to mitigate the delay on a schedule.","Further, neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or finance responsibility associated with these delays. Once the final revised schedule on cost estimate has been negotiated, we will be able to quantify owner's costs and escalation based upon the revised in-service dates.","Filing for a new order under the Base Load Review Act will be required if the scheduled in-service date exceeds the current 18-month contingency, which would be September 2018 for Unit 2 and\/or as a change in the project costs. Once we have negotiated a finalized revised schedule and cost estimate, SCE&G if required will file a petition requesting a new order with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Should SCE&G file a petition, Public Service Commission would have 6 months to issue its order.","SCE&G provided its annual update on the progress of new nuclear units to the Public Service Commission and allow ex parte briefing held on October 15. I also wanna mention that last week, the South Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion unanimously affirming the November 2012 decision of the Public Service Commission, which authorized SCE&G to modify its construction schedule and include $273 million of cost when it's capital cost under the Base Load Review Act.","I'd now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Please turn to Slide 12. On this slide, you can see an aerial photo of the new nuclear construction site from about 18 months ago, just prior to the first nuclear concrete for Unit 2. I've circled the Unit 2, Unit 3, Cooling Tower 2 Alpha and the containment vessel fabrication area. These are areas we see significant progress by going to Slide 13.","Slide 13 is an aerial photo from May of this year. You've seen this photo a few times now, but in comparison to where things stood about 18 months ago, you can really see how the project is progressing. Clearly, Cooling Tower 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are structurally complete with work progressing on the other 2. You also see the lower bowl and structural module CA-20 in place in the Unit 2 nuclear island along with significantly more work in the containment vessel assembly area.","On Slide 14, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture, you can see CA-20, along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is not covered by the auxiliary building and they are coming up to elevation 100. Elevation 100 must be achieved in order to begin work on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for plant.","On Slide 15, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2. This ring is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA-01 and CA-05.","Slide 16 shows a schematic of the modules inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of the previously mentioned module CA-01 and CA-05, which we will further discuss shortly.","Slide 17 shows a recent picture of Unit 2 module CA-01. Module CA-01 houses the steam generators, the pressurizer, and forms our fueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 46 of 47 submodules on-site and 18 of those submodules are upright and being assembled in the Module Assembly Building or MAB.","Slide 18 and 19 show pictures of the Unit 2 module CA-05. This module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On Slide 18, you can see module CA-05 being moved outside of the MAB to attempt for the addition of the final wall panel submodules.","Slide 19 shows module CA-05 inside the tent with the final submodules have been placed and final wells were completed. This module is ready for hook, and we anticipate placing it in the Unit 2 containment vessel by the end of the year.","Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Here, you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed, and the auxiliary building walls are beginning to take shape.","Turning to Slide 21, you can see a picture of the unit 2 turbine building. All of the modules have been completed and placed on the turbine building base map and progress has been made on the structural steel for the surrounding turbine building itself. The turbine building is now getting prepared for placement of the turbine rotors and generator, which will go on top of these structural steel modules.","Slide 22 shows a picture of the turbine building module CH-80 and CH-82 for Unit 3, as they're being assembled outside of the turbine building excavation.","Slide 23 may look familiar, as you probably remember pictures we have previously shown of the massive Unit 2 Deaerator component being transported to the site. However, this is a new picture of the unit 3 Deaerator, as it crosses interstate 95. This component is now on site.","Slide 24 shows a Unit 2 shield building panel. We have now received 26 of the 167 panels that will be provided by Newport News Industries for the project. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside of the panels to create a shield building.","Slide 25 shows a 3 Unit 2 main transformers and a spare. This component is sometimes referred to as generator step-up transformer or GSU.","I also want to take a moment to mention Westinghouse's recent acquisition of Mangiarotti in Italy. As you may recall, Mangiarotti manufactures various tanks and heat exchanges that make up parts of the passive cooling design for the AP1000. We believe this acquisition is positive for our project as it gives the Mangiarotti facilities the financial support they need to continue to provide high-quality nuclear components.","On slide 26, you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual line projected over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 as reflected in the August 2014 BLRA quarterly report and does not reflect any of the Consortium's estimated additional costs or scheduled delays.","As you can see, the next several years of the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right-hand axis. As we stated before, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.","Please now turn to Slide 27. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission approved an increase of $66.2 million. The new rates are effective for bills rendered on or after October 30.","Our BLRA filings for 2014 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the Commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter 2014. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2014 in November.","On Slide 28. You'll see a breakout of the total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see the product costs as filed in the August 2014 BLRA report. Project costs are currently underrunning the original approval received from the Public Service Commission. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation. This, of course, does not include consideration for the negotiations ongoing relative to the new schedule and cost information.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I have one question in 3 parts, so I won't violate the 2 or more question rule. The first question centers on, is there any update -- I may have missed this, but is there any update with expectations as to when the timing of this negotiation with the construction Consortium may end? You guys have any idea?","Stephen A. Byrne","Jim, this is Steve. What we've said a few minutes ago was that we can't predict when those negotiations will be concluded. So we started the negotiation process. It's been fruitful to date, and we can't yet determine when they will conclude.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Do you think this is going to be a '14 event or an '15 event? And your best guess.","Stephen A. Byrne","My best guess is it could be either.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Turning -- then I think this -- it will be a question now for Jimmy. I was a little bit confused on the earnings release. And I just need some refresher on the marketing businesses. You had a -- what's at the Georgia retail? And what's at the corporation?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. So we've got 2 different divisions of the same legal entity, SCANA Energy. We've got SCANA Energy Marketing, which is the kind of industrial marketing arm that markets to industrial customers across all 3 states of our footprint. Some of their capability is for marketing unused capacity of the Georgia retail marketing business. The other division of that company is the Georgia retail marketing business.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Right. So what drove the that loss in the third quarter? Or the higher loss from this?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. So Jim, it was an intentional kind of a strategic move. They've had a real good year early in the year. The industrial marketing company on the retail marketing side, the other division we've had some gas inventories that were higher than current gas market prices for a while, not higher than our sales price, but higher than the current gas market price. So we took that opportunity to move some of that storage gas out and directed from a cost standpoint to some of the industrial sales. Obviously, not charging those industrial customers at higher costs, but absorbing those losses now, refilling that storage with current market prices to get us in a better position headed into the winter heating season in the retail side.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I totally understand what's going on there. And the last one, I'm also confused, can you walk me through the revised earning guidance? But more specifically, it's not so much the $3.73, $3.90. If i back out the weather and if I assume the midpoint, that means you're at $3.57 and that would be $0.02 above your internal target, your previous internal targets, so I backed out all the weather. What are we going -- how should we think about earnings growth going forward? Are we going to redefine a base to say 2014 as the year concludes? Or do you think we're going to still keep with this '13 base?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, what our intention each year is to move to a weather normal new year. So last year it was of '13 weather normal in our plan. When we released guidance for '15 in February would be to move to a '14 weather normal.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. so if you go 3 to 6, I guess off that '14, I would've implied $3.62 on the low-end, maybe up to $3.80, $3.90. So we're going to actually look on weather-normalized basis probably as still some good year-over-year comps, is that correct?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I mean I think you had it pretty accurate before when you say if you take the weather off the midpoint of the $3.70 to $3.90.","Operator","The next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","I just want to get a little bit -- I don't know if you can help me out, Southern and you guys started at the same time and they -- and if I'm right, when you guys started, some people thought that you might be the first one to complete. And they, on their call yesterday said that they're still hoping and expect to be done on their original timeline, which is end of 2017. And that their costs estimates have not changed as they've recorded. In the same -- and I'm just trying to understand, as the same projects, same technology, same kind of thing. I guess the contract is different. But why is there such a huge delta between one party and the other? I'm sure you have also done some analysis, you have to have done analysis where you -- we are getting off by nearly 18 months, 24 months. They are still on timeline and our costs on the total project for 18 months, ours is only 55% is like $1 billion higher, I think. So I just want to understand, Jimmy, is what is so different that we are having 2 different results for a project of a similar scope, type, in the same region being built by the same kind of subcontractors and things?","Stephen A. Byrne","Ashar, this is Steve. Let me try to tackle the question. You said that we started about the same time. We certainly applied for our licenses at the same time, and we're within a couple of months of receiving licenses with Southern getting theirs first. Southern got an early site permit. So some of the on-site construction on the Southern Company project did start before ours did. We did not see the need to apply for the early site permit, so we went straight this -- to the combined operating license route, which we both ended up getting. So they did some preliminary work that we did not do. So there are some minor differences on-site. One, because of the early start they got and two, because the sites are slightly differently hard rock site versus a soft soil site. That being said, they are -- the projects are the same project, building the same things with the same vendors and the same constructor. I can't speak to what they would say relative to their schedule or cost. We know that from the original cost projections, Southern company was higher than us by some 40%, and their contract -- though I haven't seen their contract, my understanding is it is different than ours and different than in ours and as much as it may be more fixed than ours is. So what Southern says is what they've said, and you can glean that from their earnings calls. We're dealing with same Consortium that they're dealing with and we've gotten information on cost and schedule that we've updated you on. So that's about as much as we can say on the Southern project.","Ashar Khan","Okay, okay. And then, Jimmy, I guess what is being, I guess troubling to the stock and I guess the sell-side is not getting recovery or I guess that's what the stock kind of envisions is that we will have some hard time getting recovery for this overspend. So if I'm correct, what you said is that in -- by the time this agreement is done and over with, I guess the best time frame we have is end of the year. You will then file immediately with the commission the new cost estimates and timelines. And then the commission would have 6 months from that date. So if you get the January 1, you filed January 1 say. So you will know by June 30 what they have allowed you that increase. And I guess the positive thing to rule is that the Supreme Court in their decision earlier basically verified an earlier commission decision to be allowed to recover that. So it seems like they can go ahead and do that. And if they do that, that should not be then appealed to the courts because I guess we have another precedence where the Supreme Court has reaffirmed the commission's decision. Am I thinking through this correctly?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Ashar. I think your example of the time frame there is technically accurate. I think a couple times before, when we've been in for revisions in the cost and schedule, I think going from memory, they've actually ruled sooner than their 6 months fairly quickly. So they've not necessarily taken that entire 6 months. They do usually take that 6 months on a regular base rate case, just so that they have the maximum statutory allowance before the new rates go in. But I think what you said there is accurate. I don't see any real issues with that. The Supreme Court did rule in favor of us on the interveners appeal. It was a 5-0 decision by the court. And I think everything else you summarized there is pretty accurate.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of UBS.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","About the owner's cost that you were -- you haven't provided an estimate for. Most of that is labor, am I correct in understanding that?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, I would say the majority of it is probably labor and that's our labor, so these are the folks that we've hired that would now be on the project for a longer period of time because the Consortium was extending it. Some of the other costs would be things like insurance. We have to have builders' risk insurance on the project and if the project is extending, then you have to extend that policy. That will come on the policy. So there are some things that are not labor, but I would say the majority of it is probably labor.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I mean, you haven't provided an estimate of it. Is it because you might file for liquidated damages and you don't want to give away your hand on that or ...","Stephen A. Byrne","There are some things in the negotiation process that we don't necessarily want to tip our hand on. Other things would be that you have a hiring plan for your staff and you might adjust that hiring plan if you've got a new plan now that to deal with. So that could impact the owner's costs. So there are some things that we can have an impact on an owner's costs.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The moving target. And is there a kind of a rule of thumb? I mean, is it a sort of a similar magnitude to what their costs are? Is it maybe 30% of it, 20% of it? I don't know.","Stephen A. Byrne","I've never done a ratio on the costs. So what we'll do is, we'll -- when we negotiate the schedule, we'll evaluate the owner's costs based on the new schedule and then we'll put that information out.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And one other question I had is about the escalation. You said their numbers are based on 2007 without escalation. And is -- just looking at the way escalation is already affected the project, it hasn't really been much of the problem, right? Especially coming a lot less than expected, so is that sort of...","Stephen A. Byrne","To date, it's certainly the escalation has come in much less than anticipated because we had to forecast what the escalation was under that Base Load Review Act at the beginning of the process, and it has been very favorable for a large capital-intensive project. I don't know that I would want to predict what that's going to do going forward, but we didn't apply the escalation just because escalation numbers can swing fairly widely. And they've given us a relatively large range for completion. So obviously, we're trying to negotiate towards the front end of their range. And but where we end up will have an impact on the escalation. That's one reason why we're waiting on the escalation calculations.","Jimmy E. Addison","And let me just add, process wise, the escalation is allowed for in the wall, and the escalation kind of is what is up or down it's -- so that's not a separate application if that changes.","Michael Weinstein - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Is there any way to estimate what the number would be with escalation I guess in 2014 dollars?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, we've got to know all the details of what year and quarters, et cetera, those buckets fall in and we're not to that point yet.","Operator","The next question will come from Travis Miller of MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Question on the weather benefit that you got in this year. Is that going to impact at all the need for the equity? I know you guys kept it the same or shifted a little bit. It's been a -- the weather has been a pretty nice benefit for you guys. Is that going to affect next year's equity plan at all?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Travis, on the margin, it fact, that affects just a little. But more than that, it's just the timing of the construction on the project. So the weather, year-to-date, has been ballpark $50 million pretax, ballpark $30 million after tax or so. So it's not a huge driver of timing of equity. When you got a $1.8 billion liquidity line, $30 million is not a huge swing in there.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And then on the $0.29 year-to-date you've gotten on that electric margin, can you break that down in terms of nuclear project, customer growth, other stuff?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Just a minute, I may have some more on that. Yes, so we talked about -- see, $0.23 is weather, and then the BLRA has added about $0.20, I believe it is. Isn't?","Susan Wright","$0.29.","Jimmy E. Addison","$0.29, excuse me. The BLRA is added about $0.20 and then residential and commercial customer growth is about $0.06 is the other driver where we're got 1.3% customer growth.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And then the other would be, then the other 3 would just be other stuff?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Just the miscellaneous. Usage, et cetera.","Operator","The next question will come Andrew Weisel of Macquarie.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","My first question is, I just want to clarify, I think one of the thing that Ashar was asking about, you're clearly in the process of negotiating who's going to shoulder what portion of the cost overruns between the Consortium and SCANA. But whatever that number ends up being for the SCANA portion, should we think of that as entirely being borne by rate payers or would investors somehow have to share that costs overrun?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. Under the Base Load Review Act, for it not to be the responsibility of the ratepayers, they would have to be able to prove imprudence on the part of the utility. And certainly, we don't think that there's any imprudence on our part. So we don't think that, that would be any different.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Second question about the updated schedule. Again, I know that there are certain negotiations you're doing in terms of ways to shorten the delay. But the way that the Consortium has proposed the updated schedule on cost estimates to you is more the increase coming in the near term like '15 or so? Or is it more -- is the additional costs coming more in the other years like 2018 or potentially 2019?","Stephen A. Byrne","The additional costs that the Consortium would propose would really be spread out over the project. Now the project is going to spread out for a little bit longer. But I don't think the bulk of the costs will be in '14. I think the bulk of the costs, as you can see from one of the slides we presented it's going to be in '15, '16 range. But it's spread out over the entire contract period.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then just to clarify, you were talking earlier about some of those expenses being in labor and insurance type of buckets. Would those ultimately be added to the rate base once the project is done?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, they'd be a part of the capital project and would go in the rate base when the project is finished.","Jimmy E. Addison","So they get layered in each year as we would file the BLRA increases just like they do today. Steve has, I don't know, 500 or so SCE&G employees on site now, that he's already hired ramping up for training once the plant comes online. And they go into the BLRA through CWIP each May when we make the filing and into new rates each November.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Great. And my last question is, in light of the favorable trends in terms of weather help this year, your account growth remained strong, what are your latest thoughts on when you might next need to file for a general rate case in South Carolina?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. Well, our strategy remains to stay out of any kind of general rate increase during this peak nuclear construction years. And the key to that, obviously, is maintaining a reasonable return on the base electric business. We continue to do that. We continue to run it at about a 10% return on equity, as it was in our prepared comments earlier. So we're comfortable with that for the near term.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","I had a little -- some questions around the schedule, in particular, the CA -- Unit 2 CA-01 unit. I just wondered if you give a little more color. I know you mentioned you have 46 or 47 submodules on-site. Do you need to have -- what's the anticipated, for the last submodule, is that necessary before you can move forward? Or how should we think about the timing of that CA-01 since it seems like that's critical path item that's holding up a lot of other steps. Is that correct?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, Dan, the CA-01 is a critical module. The 47 submodules that comprise that come in from the Lake Charles facility by truck. And then we will make any kind of inspections from repairs on them on site, infield, then we erect them on a platform inside our Module Assembly Building. And as I think I said a while ago, we got about 16 of those or 18 of those standing on the plant, what the craft are doing now is there's fitting them up, making sure they're intolerant and they're stating the welding process. So as of right now, we have a backlog in the Module Assembly Building, which means they've got more modules that they could stand up. So that's good, they're not waiting on anything. So the absence of that one module isn't holding us up from doing the work. And we anticipate getting that last module sometime in the next couple of weeks. So it in and of itself is not going to be a holdup. And then they -- we -- they ought to progress towards completing that module. And our term is ready for hook, which means it's ready to be placed on the hook of Heavy Lift Derrick. So it basically means that the module is finished to that point where it can be picked up. We're anticipating that sometime in the first half of next year.","Dan Jenkins","The first half of '15 for CA-01 to go into the unit, is that what you're saying? Just to be clear.","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, into the containment vessel. So we basically -- we've got, on the structural module site, there are really 6 large structural modules, CA-01 through 05, and they all go inside of the containment vessel, and then the CA-20 goes outside the containment vessel, but still on the nuclear island on the base mat and forms a portion of auxillary building. The CA-20 module has been set. The CA-04 module has been set. The CA-05 module is complete, ready to be set. And so we'll do that shortly before the end of this year. CA-01 is in progress, inside the Module Assembly Building and we anticipate setting that sometime first half of next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Wondered if you could give an update of what you're seeing at the Sanmen project in China in terms of the overall progress, lessons learned, sort of key execution risks that you see at that site?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. I think the progress at the Sanmen site has been very good. If you haven't seen pictures of it, I know they've got a photo on Westinghouse's website of Sanmen unit from, I think, it was May of this year. From our look at it, they continue to be about 2 to 2.5 years ahead of us. We've said that from the start. That continues to hold. If you look at the pictures of the Sanmen site, both Unit 1 and unit 2 are coming along. Unit 1 looks like it's about finished. We -- their issues or their holes are probably the same kind of things that we're following. The reactor coolant pumps, squib valves, and we've gotten some good news from the Consortium on both of those fronts just recently. But they've got testing to go through, which they're into now. But they anticipate that they will be starting up those units. I think their goal was to try to do it by the end of '15, first part of '16. So they continue to be 2 to 2.5 years ahead of us.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And from an overall sort of standards of engineering and sort of quality control as you look at that and what you're seeing there, what's your general assessment of that?","Stephen A. Byrne","Our general assessment of their quality is good. They are building it to Western standards. They don't have the same kind of regulatory oversight that we would have from our Nuclear Regulatory Commission. But that aside, we think that the quality of construction over there is good. They are using some indigenous suppliers, particularly on the secondary side of the plant or the turbine building side of the plant. So that's where they're going to vary from us. So whereas we would you use Toshiba for the turbine and generator, for example, they might use somebody else. Some of the cabling and things are going to try and use indigenous Chinese suppliers that we wouldn't necessarily want to use. So there are going to be some differences particularly on the secondary side of the plant. But the plant is coming right along.","Operator","Our next question will be from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just coming back to the summer project. I want to make sure I understand somethings and I'm trying to get my arm around on something. So the $660 million, that's in '07 dollars that I could use a very low inflation number or escalation number to think about what that -- 1% or 2% if I want to just back of the envelope to think about what that is in terms of 2014 dollars. Is there a back of the envelope we can use for the owner's cost? Meaning, when you first did the budget for the project and you first talked about it, what percent of total cost did owner's cost make up? I'm just trying to think about back of the envelope way to prorate this.","Stephen A. Byrne","Michael, off the top of my head, I don't remember what the total amount of the project cost was owner's cost. It was probably less than 10% of the total cost. We can probably got some refinements for you and give you a call back with that number. But I don't have it at my fingertips. But it was not a huge portion of the total cost.","Jimmy E. Addison","Steve, let me just interject. That's available from the public data mine or is on website and the PSCs in our filing, it shows up broken down.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the latest BLRA or in the original one?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, it's in the original. I'm not sure if it's in each quarter or not. But we'll have IR follow up with you on that on where it's available publicly.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And is it just safe to assume that the owner's cost would escalate at kind of the same rate, if I took the $660 million and divided it by the last projected cost and then took whatever the owner's costs was and the escalated at the same amount? Is that kind of a rough way to get to what the potential cost increase would be?","Jimmy E. Addison","I don't know that you can exactly do that. Some of the $660 million that the Consortium has given to us, they are truly rebaselining things. So they're looking at the experience that they've gained to date on things like module fabrication, on-site efficiencies, engineering completion, those kinds of things. So the owner's cost wouldn't follow that necessarily. A good majority of owner's cost is just because the staff that we've hired are going to be on site for a longer period of time. And then there are some other things, like I discussed insurance, we'll have some increased regulatory commission fees, those kind of things. But the bulk of it is going to be with the people that are there for longer periods of time. And we're looking at things that we can do now, perhaps we don't need that staff quite as early with whatever is the new schedule that we negotiate. We may take some actions to kind of delay some of that hiring. So we have -- we will have some impact on the cost.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then 1 or 2 just kind of more modeling related items to me at least you all talked a little bit about, in the corporate, in the gas marketing business description. You also talked about a little bit higher corporate or holding company interest costs. Is there a new debt issuance? Or did you ramp up short-term debt during the quarter at the holding company level?","Stephen A. Byrne","No, that is a very, very minor piece of that variance, Michael, so don't get too hung up on that one.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then lastly, going into the end of the year, what's your expectation for O&M for like the fourth quarter? Like you've talked about O&M being up a good bit in '14 over '13. It hasn't quite been up as much as maybe expected it would be, and you've all done a good job managing that. How do you end the year on the O&M line?","Stephen A. Byrne","I think the run rate you're seeing to date is a pretty good projection for the fourth quarter based on what we know today.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning kind of a similar year-over-year growth rate that we've seen in the other 3 quarters?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. We continue to do a better job than our plan in managing that cost. So we're encouraged by that.","Operator","And the next question will be a follow-up from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","Jimmy, I think, in response to Jim's question, I just wanted to clarify. So the midpoint is right now is $3.80. And if you take $0.20 off it for the abnormal weather, you get to a $3.60 normalized 2014. And that would be the new start point when you give guidance for the 3% to 6% for '15 and onwards going forward?","Jimmy E. Addison","Only if that's where we end up at year end. So I'm sure some things will change between now and the earnings at December 31. But that is based upon today. There will be both weather-related changes in Q4 and non-weather-related changes, but we'll evaluate all of that and come out with a new number. So I'm not giving you $3.60 as a base today. No, we will give you a new number in February.","Ashar Khan","Okay. But you said you base it off normalized earnings, right? Normalized weather earnings, right? Is that correct or there certain other things that you do?","Jimmy E. Addison","That is correct, but some other things could change in Q4 that I don't know of today. There could be something that's abnormal, that's unrelated to weather.","Ashar Khan","Understood, understood. But right now, the $3.70 to $3.90, the new forecast, that is higher just because of the abnormal weather that you have had. Is that correct? Based on what you're giving us today.","Jimmy E. Addison","Not totally, but the majority of it is. So look, we're raising it $0.25 and the weather is $0.23 or so of that. So there's $0.02 or $0.03 in there for things we've experienced year-to-date that we're putting into the revised guidance today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over the Jimmy Addison for his closing comments.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. First of all, I want to say thanks to everyone, for your patience, for bearing with us today with this technical problem we had. Thank you for hanging with us for a couple of hours here to get through this. I want to tell you, we're pleased with our results through the first 3 quarters, with only a quarter left in the year, and we continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our business in a safe and reliable manner.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","","Byron Hinson","Thank you. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2011.","Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. The slides and the earnings release that we\u2019ll refer to in this call are available at scana.com.","Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today\u2019s call, which are not statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties, which are shown on slide two and discussed in the company\u2019s SEC filings. The company does not recognize obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Finally, as noted on slide two, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the slides used in conjunction with this earnings call. ","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","","Jimmy Addison","","Thanks Byron, and thank you all for joining us today. During today\u2019s call, we will discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2011, and provide an update on our outlook for 2012. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project. ","Let\u2019s start on Slide 3, which reflects SCANA\u2019s 2011 full-year basic earnings per share of 3.01 compared to $2.99 per share in 2010. Increases in electric margin from rate increases under the Base Load Review Act, and lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by lower gas margins, higher interest, property tax and depreciation expense and share dilution. ","Our results were within our 2011 guidance of 2.95 to 3.10 per share, and only $0.01 below our internal target of 3.02. The mild weather in Georgia cost us approximately $0.01 in December. ","I\u2019ll remind you that 2010 includes $0.07 of weather prior to the implementation of electric weather normalization, resulting in weather normalized earnings of $2.92. You can reference the appendix on Slide 18 for a reconciliation from GAAP to weather normalized earnings.","Slide 4 shows the basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2011 were $0.76 per share compared to $0.74 per share in the same quarter of 2010. While operation and maintenance expenses were lower in the current quarter, those benefits were offset by the anticipated cost of our capital program, higher interest, property tax, and depreciation expense along with related share dilution.","Now on Slide 5, I\u2019d like to review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company\u2019s full-year 2011 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.04 compared to 2010. Improved margins from increases under the Base Load Review Act offset the increased capital related cost.","For the fourth quarter, SCE&G earnings were $0.02 lower than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned increased capital related cost. PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings for 2011, shown in red, were $0.37 per share compared to $0.36 per share in 2010.","Fourth quarter 2011 earnings were flat over the same period in 2010. Increases in customer growth along with lower operating and maintenance expenses were partially offset by higher depreciation and property tax expense.","SCANA Energy, in green, reported lower earnings for the full year 2011, due principally to milder weather. ","I\u2019m pleased to report that SCANA Energy has again been selected to serve as the regulated provider for the state for the upcoming two-year term, covering September 2012 through August 2014. SCANA Energy has served as a regulated provider since the program\u2019s inception in 2002.","SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a 2011 loss for the year of $0.01 per share and earnings for the quarter of $0.01 per share compared to losses of $0.03 and $0.02 per share respectively for 2010. The improvement is due to improved results in our communications business during 2011.","Slide 6 shows customer growth at our major subsidiaries. We experienced customer growth in our North and South Carolina regulated business, while Georgia, while the Georgia market saw a decrease in customer count over the prior year. We are pleased that our regulated businesses continue to yield organic growth. The reduction in Georgia is due to a loss of customers in our Regulated Provider program, which was partially offset by increased customer count in our deregulated sector.","Several marketers now have offerings such as a prepay service as an alternative to the regulated provider structure. Additionally, our analysis also shows that customers have been slower to connect their gas service this winter, due to the unseasonably mild temperatures. ","Our Electric and Gas sales statistics can be found in the press release we filed earlier today and are available on our website. ","On our weather normalize basis, electric residential sales are up approximately 1%. Industrial sales also saw improvement with an increase of a little more than 1%. Commercial sales continued to lag behind last year with a decrease of approximately 2% when weather normalized. ","As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, industrial growth typically leads, followed by residential, and then commercial. So it appears that some of the industrial activity in our area over the last couple of years has translated into residential consumption, but we\u2019ve yet to see that in the commercial sector. These results were anticipated in our 2011 plan, and we\u2019ve forecast similar patterns in 2012.","While we continue to see customer growth, we expect that customer usage will be slightly lower in 2012 as a result of demand side management programs, new lightbulb standards that are being phased in, more energy efficient air conditioners, and general conservation.","For the year, retail sales of natural gas were lower by 1.6% because of milder weather. The residential and commercial sectors were down approximately 18% and 9% respectively, while industrial sales, which are not significantly impacted by weather increased more than 7%. ","Of course weather is contemplated in our rate mechanisms in both regulated jurisdictions, so there is no margin impact in the residential and commercial sectors. ","Fourth quarter brought more industrial announcements in our service territory. On Slide 7, you can see a update of economic expansion plans in South Carolina. During the fourth quarter alone, announced investment exceeded $500 million with the largest coming from a pharmaceutical company that will be located near our corporate campus here in Central South Carolina. These announcements during the quarter suggest the ultimate creation of over 1,900 additional jobs.","For the full year, total announced investment was over $3.2 billion and more than 7,700 expected jobs. This was the best year for industrial economic announcements in South Carolina in the last decade.","Unemployment continued to show improvement in the areas we serve. As you can see on Slide 8, we continue to see improvement at the national, state, and local level. At December 31, the unemployment rate in South Carolina was the lowest since 2008, and is now lower than that of North Carolina and Georgia, as a surge of economic development activities begin to take hold.","Our service territory of South Carolina is heavily concentrated in the Charleston and Columbia Metro areas where unemployment is lower than the national average as denoted in the green box. ","Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated returns in South Carolina, regulatory calendar for 2012. The chart at the top shows the earned returns as of September 30, the date of our most recent filings. ","Our Electric operations earned 8.74% a slight improvement over our June filing, due to margin improvement and cost containment. This figure is exclusive of any new nuclear equip or associated rate increases as those amounts are handled separately under the Base Load Review Act and earned an 11% ROE.","As noted on the second line, we have $1.1 billion of new nuclear equip currently in rates. This amount covers spending through June 2011. Subsequent to June, we incurred incremental quip of $156 million that will be considered in our next revised rates filing later this year.","Many of you have asked if we expect to follow the base electric case in the near-term. While we have not made a decision of when we would file our next case, we typically file on a two-to-three year cycle. One of the stipulations from our last case was that we could not have another increase in base rates for 24 months, or until after the middle of 2012. ","As we have mentioned previously, our 2012 guidance does not include additional revenue from a base rate increase. We recognize the importance of earning our allowed return, and we will evaluate our position regularly.","As of September 30, our Gas Business at SCE&G was earning approximately 9.5% after annualizing the impact from the most recent $8.5 million rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act, effective in November. ","Our North Carolina Gas Business continues to perform well and is earning it\u2019s allowed return, principally due to the growth in the business and cost control. ","The bottom of the slide includes two time lines depicting our regulatory filings schedule for 2012. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate making our annual gas RSA filing in June, and our annual nuclear BLRA revised rate application in May.","Yesterday, we filed our most recent BLRA status report with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff for the fourth quarter. Steve will address the project fully in a few minutes.","Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast assumes receipt of our COL in early 2012, and incorporates new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA filing. We have also provided a preliminary estimate of additional owner\u2019s cost related to our nuclear project which Steve will discuss. As you can see, new nuclear spending accounts for more than half of our projected CapEx over the next three years.","Please turn to Slide 11. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2014. In January, we completed two of our three planned debt offerings for the year. We issued $250 million in medium term notes at SCANA for a refinancing and $250 million of first mortgage bonds at SCE&G to fund CapEx. We were pleased with the market\u2019s reception to these offerings, with substantial over subscriptions and historically low interest rates, and we remain confident in our ability to raise the funds necessary to complete construction of our nuclear project from public sources.","We expect an additional issuance of approximately $200 million at SCE&G later in the year. ","We continue to anticipate to draw the remaining funds from our equity floor during the fourth quarter of 2012. From the beginning, our strategy has been to finance our nuclear project from public sources with 50% debt and 50% equity, and nothing has changed.","I would also like to touch briefly on our pension assets. I\u2019m pleased to report that our pension plan is adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any until at least 2013. Our plan was recognized as one of the best funded among our peers in a recent study by UBS.","Now I would like to discuss our 2012 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 12. We reaffirm our 2012 guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share with an internal target of $3.17, and our long-term outlook to deliver 3 to 5% earnings growth over the three-to-five year period, based on the 2010 weather normalize base of $2.92 per share. We are pleased that our 2011 earnings per share of $3.01 were within \u2013 were in line with our guidance, and essentially at our announced target of $3.02.","I want to point out that our guidance is based on basic earnings per share. As you have probably noticed, we focus on basic earnings in our discussions with you. In May of 2011, we entered in to an equity forward contract. And to comply with accounting requirements, we present basic and diluted earnings in our financial statements. Basic earnings per share reflect the shares we\u2019ve actually issued during the year. In contrast, diluted earnings per share include the effect of theoretical shares that would have been outstanding if we had issued the shares under the forward contracts, which we didn\u2019t. If our stock price stays above the contract forward price, we expect similar amounts of potential dilution through the fourth quarter of 2012, when we anticipate drawing the remaining funds under the forward.","At that time, those shares will begin to affect our basic earnings, and are considered in our forecasted share price count and earnings guidance. The diluted commutation is required but is a little consequent in this particular situation as the shares were not issued and can only dilute earnings when issued.","We continue to forecast 2012 residential customer growth to be in line with 2011, while we believe average customer usage will be slightly lower as a result of continued efficiency efforts. We plan to keep O&M expenses relatively flat over 2011, with modest growth in CapEx-related cost of property taxes, depreciation, interest and share dilution.","We anticipate weather normalized earnings from our Georgia business will be in the range of $0.22 to $0.24 per share. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was 30.28% and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%. ","Additionally, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and the 2011 gas RSA filing, as well as the effects of additional cash flow from our tax strategies. These tax strategies will enable us to delay drawing the remainder of our equity forward until the fourth quarter of 2012, and should postpone a supplemental equity offering until 2013, thus minimizing the effects of dilution.","I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Steve, to provide a update on our nuclear project.","Steve Bryne","","Thanks, Jimmy. I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing proceedings continue to progress towards a successful conclusion. At the end of the third quarter, we needed a completion of three items in order for the commission to be able to approve our COL. ","The first, was completion of a mandatory hearing before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission commissioners. This was completed in October. The hearing was uncontested and we believe went well.","We also needed a 401 Water Quality permit, and this was received in December. Finally, we needed the NRC\u2019s approval of the AP1000 certified design. As you can see in the green section of the chart, the NRC has approved the AP1000 certified design. This approval came on December 22, and the rule was published in the federal register on December 30. The rule became effective immediately upon it being published in the federal register.","At this point, there are not any remaining steps for us to take in order to receive our license. We were pleased to see the commissions recent affirmation vote to issue southern companies COL. We believe the commission will follow the same process in regards to our license. After the session, the license will be signed and we can proceed with full nuclear construction. We continue to have confidence that our license will be issued early this year. ","Please turn now to Slide 14, which gives you an overview of some of the activity that is underway at the site. Construction of the heavy lift derrick continues and the attachment of the boom and the back mass to the carriage has been completed. Our control room simulators are being installed, and welding of the containment vessel lower bowl continues to progress well. Construction of the cooling towers continues to move forward as plan; we continue to make progress on construction of the switchyard, as you can see by the picture at the bottom of the slide. The switchyard is scheduled to be energized in March of 2013, which fully supports the nuclear project schedule.","On Slide 15, you can see an aerial shot of the site from late 2011, which highlights several of the items I discussed. As Jimmy mentioned early, we filed our quarterly status report with the South Carolina Public Service Commission yesterday. This report provided an overview of our project and a discussion of project cost.","Construction work on the site is proceeding safely and efficiently. The project has met the goal of completing the work necessary to allow the first nuclear safety-related construction to commence onsite, when the COL is issued. The project has compiled a safety record that is unprecedented for a heavy construction site of its size, totalling well over 5 million safe work hours, with only two lost-time instances since construction began over three years ago.","In the quarterly BLRA filing, we also discussed additional costs that are included in our current estimates, which are described at the top of Slide 16. These cost include increased cost being passed on to SCE&G by Shawn Westinghouse, as a result of the new Federal Healthcare Laws, increased cost for cyber security regulation, incremental cost associated with the design modifications of the water discharge system, and additional forecasted transmission costs.","In addition to these cost, currently reflected in the recent BLRA filing, we anticipate an increase in perspective owner\u2019s cost of approximately $150 million, related to accelerated hiring and training of staff, along with the cost of facilities, equipment, and information technology to support the nuclear units and associated personnel.","A portion of these cost expected in 2012 through 2014 was included as a line item on the CapEx forecast Jimmy discussed previously. It is important to note that these cost are preliminary and may change as we refine the estimates by year and cost category. ","In the coming months, we plan to make a updated cost filing with the public service commission to include these cost in our budget. ","As you might recall, this filing\u2019s necessary due to the decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court in 2010, which found that previously-approved general contingency cost could not be included in the forecasts approved for the Basic Review Act. Instead, as the proposed use of contingency funds is identified and itemized to specific cost categories, we must file with the PSC for approval.","I would now like to talk about the COL delay study. When we signed our EPC contract in 2008, it was anticipated that the COL would be issued by the NRC in July of 2011, due primarily to delays in approval of Revision 19 to the certified design, it should now be issued early this year.","As we have previously discussed, in 2011 we asked Shaw and Westinghouse to perform a COL delay impact study, which would provide various cost and timing alternatives arising from this delay in issuance of the COL. ","The first scenario compresses the construction schedule for Unit 2, the first new unit, to retain the original commercial operation date set forth in the EPC contract. The second scenario pushes out commercial operation date for Unit 2 to account for the COL delay, while maintaining the commercial operation date for Unit 3 unchanged.","The third scenario considers delaying the commercial operation date of Unit 2, and accelerating the date for Unit 3, in order to take advantage of economies and efficiencies in the construction schedule. While negotiations are not complete, we have indicated to the consortium that we intend to pursue scenario three.","Included in negotiations of the COL delay study are all the commercial issues currently on the table.  As mentioned in our February 14 BLRA filing, the consortium has asserted the right to addition cost to recovery under the EPC contract for cost associated with design modifications to the shield building and structural modules, delay in NRC licensing and unanticipated rock conditions. We have not accepted the volatility of those claims. ","While the parties have not reached an agreement, the upper bond of our portion of the claims is estimated to be approximately $188 million, valued in 2007 dollars. These cost have not been billed to the project. We are still hopeful these claims will be resolved through negotiations. We know that you are interested in the results of our negotiations and we will certainly communicate that information to you, once it is available.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  And our first question will come from David Paus of Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch, please go ahead.","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Good afternoon.","Jimmy Addison","","Hello, Dave.","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","I just have a few questions on \u201911, but actually before, that I may have missed this, but in your 2012 guidance, what range are you assuming for the earned ROE at SCE&G Electric excluding new nuc? ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, we haven\u2019t published an assumed ROE there, but what I did say in my comments earlier is that, you know, we\u2019ve got moratorium on any new rate cases until the middle of the year, and we\u2019ve not included any new revenue in our earnings guidance for 2012.  So our current, most recent published return on the non-nuc is about 8 \u00be.  ","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it.  All right, and just on 2011, in the 246 that you earned at SCE&G, how much of that is related to your return on your nuclear investments?","Jimmy Addison","","Oh, David, I don\u2019t really have it analyzed that way because you would have to consider, of course, accumulative BLRA increases less the associated debt and equity cost of carrying those increases.  I really haven\u2019t analyzed it that way.  But it will certainly build over the next few years, but it\u2019s not a huge amount at this point.","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, is it fair to say if I just took your average QUIP and I think you\u2019re allowed a 53% equity and 11% return, that should be roughly your earnings from nuclear project?","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, that\u2019s fair.","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","","Okay.  And just on the \u2013 I know it\u2019s only a penny on the pair and another segment, but I know there is some offsetting items in there, could you just give us some color on how that penny breaks out on the CGTC Energy marketing?  I know you mentioned communications was a huge driver in the last year, I believe a lot of that would be offset by I guess just interest at the hold COL level,  Is it \u2013 can you kind of just break those out, break that penny out?  And then\u2026","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, we\u2026","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","What do you expect going forward?","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, I think what you saw this year is a reasonable expectation.  We kind of, you know, we made improvement on it this year.  I expect us to be able to whittle away on that from a net basis and the reason for that being the debt that we renewed is at or below, the existing costs of a debt that is being replaced.  We really don\u2019t have any more debt, refinancing subdued for the next eight or nine years at the hold COL.  So really it\u2019s going to come down to what kind of growth do we see in those smaller subsidiaries and we haven\u2019t in the past broken out the detailed numbers in those subs, but I think they will \u2013 I think it\u2019s reasonable to see that they will grow at least at the level that the major part of the business does.  So I\u2019d expect us to continue to be able to mitigate that interest cost at the holding company through the earnings of other small subs.","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it, okay.  And just on your new \u2013 last question, on \u2013 I may have missed this too, but just when do you expect to make that updated filing that you refer to in your quarterly filing last night?  And then, I guess, if you said, when do you expect the unit two completion date or substantial completion date to be?  Are we talking months, are we talking \u2013 what\u2019s the \u2013 what kind of color can you give us there?","Steve Bryne","","Yes, relative to the completion date for the first new unit, which for us is unit two, we\u2019re looking to accommodate the delay in receiving the license.  So, what we\u2019ve been talking about with our consortium partners is roughly a six-month delay, so, we are looking at late \u201816 as opposed to, what, April of \u201916, which was the originally BC contract date.  ","David Paus \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Thank you so much.","Operator","","And our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of UBS, please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Hi guys, how are you?","Jimmy Addison","","Good, Jim.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Hey, just a follow up on that last question, so, you Unit Two would come on line at the end of 2016, and under scenario three, when would Unit Three come on now?","Jimmy Addison","","Well, we\u2019re still working out what is the optimum, what we\u2019re trying to avoid here is demobilization and remobilization costs, and when we had originally picked the split between those units, it really was not what the contractor, or the vendors, would have ideally liked.  So what we\u2019ve asked them for is what is that ideal split between the units that will save us money, and we think it\u2019s going to come in to be accelerating unit number three by less than a year, but probably somewhere in the 10, 11 month range.  ","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay, super.  And then I guess the second question is on \u2013 you know, I\u2019ve been following on the NRC website closely and I haven\u2019t seen an affirmation meeting posted.  Do you know what the rules are on about how much notice they have to give on that; like 24 hours, 72 hours, a week, or what have you?","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, the short answer is I don\u2019t know what all the rules are; in general, for an affirmation hearing they would give seven day notice, which would be today.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","","","But here are circumstances under which they could give less than a seven day notice.  So for their next meeting on the 22nd, the 15th, or today, would be that seven day notice period.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","","And they follow the seven day period for Southern, right Steve?  ","Steve Bryne","","They did with \u2013 I know they follow that, but there are some circumstances where they can go with less than seven day notice.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","","And honestly, I do not understand all of those rules.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay, I understand.  I don\u2019t think I understand them either.  Last question is could you just talk a little bit about where maybe Santee Cooper stands in the negotiation to sell down it\u2019s stake in the summary units?  ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, what we know is Santee is still in negotiations to sell down some portion of their units, and we have not been involved in those negotiations to date.  So nothing has really changed from what we\u2019ve previously disclosed, which is that they have notified us of their interest in divesting some of their 45% and they are in negotiations, but I don\u2019t know exactly where they stand.","","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Let me ask this question a little bit differently.  Is there anything that you guys see on a 10 or 15 year horizon economically in the state of South Carolina that would make them materially, maybe take out all of their \u2013 have no stake left?","Jimmy Addison","","Well, you\u2019re asking me to read the minds of Santee Cooper, but I will tell you that from me, personally, I would not see anything that would drive them to zero, which I think was your question.  I think they are going to want to have some nuclear portfolio.  I believe they have some stated objectives for a emission-free generation in which they cannot achieve without nuclear.  And then everything else is going to depend on a couple of things.  One, it\u2019s going to be load growth, and secondly, it\u2019s going to be the impacts of EPA rules and regulations on coal facilities.  ","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay, that is all I had today, thanks guys.","Jimmy Addison","","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","","Good afternoon, thanks.","Jimmy Addison","","Good afternoon.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","","Is there anything that we could read into the Chairman\u2019s decision to vote against Vogel that might have any kind of impact on the upcoming vote for you guys?","Jimmy Addison","","No\u2026","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","","Material differences that\u2026","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, we don\u2019t expect any material differences; I would anticipate that when we see our vote, it will be the same as the Vogel vote because there\u2019s really is no reason for it to be any different.  They\u2019re the reference combined offering a license application, and we are the first subsequent.  So at the premise under which he voted against it for Vogel should be the same as his vote for us.  So my anticipation would be that we will still see a four to one vote.  ","His vote really was based on the Fukushima lessons learned and their incorporation and he would like to see a licensed condition.  The other commissioners did not see it that way, and in reality, from my perspective, there is really very little difference whether there was a licensed condition or whether we have to comply with all of the Fukushima-related orders that the NRC will put out once we become a licensee.  So we\u2019re going to have to comply with them anyway whether there was a licensed condition or not, I think really is not really that relevant.  ","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","","Sure, and then on those extra regulations, I assume that if you had to incur extra costs based on whatever the NRC comes out on, you\u2019d have to go back to the South Carolina regulators, get all of that approved, get that into the budget, under the BLRA, is that the plan that you guys would foresee if you needed to make adjustments to the current project?","Jimmy Addison","","If we had to make any adjustments to the project we would see that as additional costs.  They would either be an owner\u2019s cost, or cost that the consortium would pass onto us, but more likely an owner\u2019s cost, and then we would go into the public service commission which we\u2019re roughly planning on doing annually to  update anyway, with an update filing to recover those costs.  ","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar, Inc.","Okay, great.  Thanks a lot.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Thank you. ","Operator","","Our  next question will come from John Ali from Decade Capital.  Please go ahead. ","John Ali - Decade Capital","","Hey guys, nice quarter.  Just a question, I apologize if you answered this, I joined late.  When you filed for the new build schedule what does that do to 12\/13 CapEx?","Jimmy Addison","","Well, we've been delayed by, we're running almost eight months now, Steve, beyond what we expected for the COL delivery, seven months or so.  So we've naturally pushed some of the construction that was expected in 2011 into 2012.  So we're kind of pushing that a little bit into another year.  We really haven't changed it a great deal other than the two items Steve outlined earlier, which we the potential owner\u2019s cost increases that were filed in our BLRA yesterday, referenced.  And also, these challenge costs we're negotiating with the consortium. ","Steve Bryne","","So keep in mind that a lot of the capital expenditures we would not intend to change.  For example, we've got a large component being manufactured overseas, things like reactor vessels or steam generators or piping, turbine generators, all those kinds of things.  We would not anticipate changing the schedule for delivery on those, we would like to keep the pressure on those suppliers to hold their original dates.  I would much prefer to store it onsite then to give them another six months in their delivery schedule.  And then we've got another raft of activities that are going on at the site.  For example, the containment vessel itself, which is a very, very large steel cylinder, we are fabricating that right at the site adjacent to our construction project.  And we would anticipate continuing with the fabrication construction of those kinds of items irregardless of which option we would have chosen in that COL delay study.  ","John Ali - Decade Capital","","So the CapEx in 12\/13 won't be materially different from what's in the slides today?","Jimmy Addison","","That's right, our best estimate today is in the slide.  That slide is updated from what we had previously published.  For example, 2012 went up about $90 million and that's due to that push of items from 11 to 12, not increased cost in 2012.  ","John Ali - Decade Capital","","Right, but there's no slide from pushing the Unit Two back?","Jimmy Addison","","No, at this point, well, of course we, as Steve said earlier, and maybe you missed this part of his comments, but we have indicated a preference for the Option 3, we have not gotten the revised construction cash curve from the consortium back.  And once we have that we will refine the CapEx.","John Ali - Decade Capital","","Okay, but if that were to, if Option 3 were to become official what would you expect the CapEx in \u201911-\u201812 to do?  Or all the changes in kind of like the outer years \u2013 \u201914, \u201815?","Steve Bryne","","Yes, unfortunately I really don't have an answer to that.  That's why we've asked the contractor to give us that answer, we just don't have that.  As Steve gave you some example of things that are going on in parallel with the COL delay, I mean, I wouldn't expect a material change in it, but I would expect some.  ","John Ali - Decade Capital","","Got you.  And today\u2019s guidance assumes normal weather or assumes kind of the weather we've all been having?","Jimmy Addison","","Well, that's irrelevant in all our regulated jurisdictions of the Carolina's because we have weather normalization in our electric and both of our LDC gas businesses, so\u2026","John Ali - Decade Capital","","[Inaudible] Georgia.","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, the only one is Georgia.  It was a little milder in January, but that's based on normal weather.  ","John Ali - Decade Capital","","Got you, thank you very much.   ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Yes, hey, guys, thanks.  I just want to follow on John's questions, I want to make sure I understand.  The CapEx guidance you laid out in that BLRA report last night and that are on the slides do not reflect the feedback you're expecting to get from Westinghouse and Shaw, is that correct?  And that feedback could have a revised schedule.","Steve Bryne","","Yes, that's correct.  It could have a revised CapEx expenditure schedule, but I don't think that we would anticipate that it would be hugely different than what we already have loaded into our CapEx budget for the next three years.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Got it.  It can push it out, you know, move \u201812 CapEx in \u201813 a little bit or \u201813 into \u201814, but the grand total of three year CapEx probably doesn't move around a lot.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, the point we're really trying to get across here is that even if we were to defer the one unit by like six months, not everything stops or is deferred six months.  We've got a lot of things that we're continuing to push towards their original completion date.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Got it, okay.  The other thing, the CapEx guidance laid out on these slides does not include \u2013 I want to make sure I understand this; it does include the incremental $150 million of owner\u2019s cost, but it does not include the $188 million disputed cost between you and the contractors?","Jimmy Addision","","Yes, that's correct.  ","Steve Bryne","","Yes, with one clarification, Michael.  As far as the 150, it includes the parts that we project to fall within \u201812, \u201813, and \u201814 so some of it is in \u201815, \u201816, \u201817.  So we estimate about $85 to $90 million of that 150 is in \u201813 and \u201814 with none of it in \u201812.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Got it, but that's in your numbers already?","Jimmy Addison","","Absolutely.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Okay.  Last thing, in the BRLA report you all talk a little bit about two issues that we had questions on.  One was some of the QA\/QC issues that Shaw Modular Systems in terms of kind of the fabrication of the modules.  And second, the permitting process for some of the water, the NPDEF permits.  Can you just walk us through what some of the issues are and what any concerns you may have and what you're doing to resolve those issues.  ","Steve Bryne","","Let's start first with the modules, Shaw Modular Solution facility in Lake Charles is a facility that has, that Shaw constructed specifically for assembly of these modules or what we would call submodules that will be shipped to our site and then finally assembled at our site.  Now we have a schedule for receipt of those and as is typical of startup type facilities, they're struggling a little bit with getting their quality assurance and quality control up to nuclear standards.  That is something that we're trying to help them with.  They did have one Nuclear Regulatory Commission inspection in 2011 that was suspended basically because they didn't have enough work going for the NRC to evaluate.  They've subsequently finished that inspection in November of last year.  So they're getting their act together at Shaw Modular Solutions, but as we point out in that BLRA a quarterly filing, it is an area of focus for us, and we SCE&G, are spending a lot of time at that facility.  Relative to the other part of your question, remind me again what the question was.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","On the NPEDF permit process.","Steve Bryne","","Yes, we have had, we have a lot of permits that are required for this, the COL is obviously the biggest one, but it's just one.  We have permits that are issued by a lot of different agencies.  The NPEDF is something that should not slow us down.  It\u2019s just that we had anticipated receiving it at one date and we were asked for additional information that really has to do with flows in the Broad River.  And what you do is you evaluate the lowest flow condition over an extended period of time and they wanted us to reevaluate those flows.  So we'll do that and get back to them, but we don't anticipate that's going to have any impact on the project.  ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","","Got it, okay.  I appreciate it guys, thank you.  ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Good afternoon.  I was hoping you could talk a little bit about industrial sales in the fourth quarter, which did seem down a little bit.  And maybe talk about them relative to the industrial gas sales, which actually seem to be pretty strong.  And sort of what you're seeing from an industrial perspective.  ","Jimmy Addisonh","","Well, things continue to go well here from an industrial stand, but as far as new announcements go we had another 1,900 jobs or so that we referenced back on Slide 7 that were announced in the fourth quarter.  So we continue a good trend of industrial announcements.  ","You know, I don't have specifics, couldn't disclose them if I could, but there are more in the hopper here.  So we really see good long-term platform there for restoration.  ","We've got a good distribution in industrial around our service territory.  The largest of any segment is chemicals, which is about a quarter of our base.  But then it's well distributed among metals, paper, rubber, plastics, et cetera.  ","The fourth quarter was a little down.  I'm not too concerned about that now because all of the other announcements we've had.  And as those come on, the short of it is our largest 20 or 25 customers continue to grow as a group and it has been some of the smaller industrials that have been more erratic.  And I think we're showing up there in the fourth quarter kind of year of year.  ","But if you think back to 2010, there was a rapid buildup in industrial sales compared to 2009 coming out of the depth of the recession.  And I think a lot of inventories were beginning to be rebuilt and now some of these smaller industrial customers are kind of finding their point of equilibrium.  And I'm not too concerned about that in the fourth on the electric side.  On the gas side, you're just continuing to see a lot of folks that can convert from alternative fuels run on gas just because of the low price of natural gas compared to other petroleum products is very competitive.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Okay, great, that's helpful.  And in light of your confidence around industrial, do you guys have a forecast for 2012 industrial?","Jimmy Addision","","Well we've not broken it out separately but it's obviously built in and it's a bottom-up build from detailed discussions with our account reps with all the industrials that are our territory based on what we think they're going to do from production, expansion, et cetera, and that's built into our earnings guidance and our internal point estimate of 317.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Okay, great.  And then Jimmy maybe you could talk a little bit about the decision points around the 2012 rate case.  I appreciate that in your prepared comments you mentioned you had not made any decision and obviously has to be a filing in the second half of this year, but just sort of how the decision points must go weighing against your current [Inaudible] earning situation.","Jimmy Addison","","Well, we're going to typically follow that two-to-three year cycle.  The middle of the year will be two years and obviously middle of 2013 will be three years, we're going to stay within that band.  But I think all of you appreciate the importance of communications with the intermediary body, the Office of Regulatory Staff, they serve a critical role here.  We're going to keep them informed of where we are.  We're going to be considerate of the timing of increases under the Base Load Review Act.  We're going to be considerate of items surrounding our potential fuel hearing and adjustments like that.  So we're really going to try to do anything we can to keep from really pancaking those increases in rates.  And so that's a lot of what goes into the strategy.  And we'd like to get a little more feel for what's coming, you know, how the recovery is economically and how much of a potential margin need, that 200 basis points we're looking at there, how much that might be filled by growth in customers and expansion of the economy as opposed to having to raise the rates on the customers to provide it.  So that's a long answer to say somewhere between the middle of \u201812 and the middle of \u201813.","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Got you.  It sounds like it's basically economic and administrative issues.  There's nothing really beyond that.  I appreciate, you know, I'm not asking you to predict when you're going to file and know you have to communicate with your folks there.  But if I'm just to categorize it, it sounds like it's economic issues and then more administrative timing around rate cases.  ","Jimmy Addison","","I would agree.  I mean, it's a matter of when, not if.  And when you have a business like this that's subject to inflationary pressures and you only have increases periodically you've got to go back and you can't just absorb those costs, although we've done a good job of handling the cost over the last five years or so.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Great.  and then last question, I didn't think, maybe I missed it, when do you expect Westinghouse Shaw to come back to you with the re-cut costs as a result of the COL delay study, and your selection, or at least leaning towards scenario three?","Jimmy Addison","","The first thing we need to do is conclude on negotiations with the consortium on the validity of those costs, which we have not accepted.  So I don't know whether it would be a month, six weeks, two months, something along those lines, but I would imagine it's somewhere in the next couple of months we ought to have both a new construction schedule, milestone schedule, and a CapEx forecast.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Got you, but if you're just getting that in sort of a three-month timeframe it might be, is it fair to say that it might be a bit of a stretch to assume it would be in the next BLRA filing and that it might be a second from now?  So not the May, but the August?","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, I really think that depends a lot on the negotiations.  I think the consortium is certainly capable of turning around within a month or two, it just depends on how else they're going to follow that if they know that we're still in negotiating with them.  But at some point they have to give us that new schedule and if we decide to forgo the negotiations and go to some other kind of dispute resolution then they would give it to us based on what they know at the time.  And then they would have to rectify that when the dispute resolution played out.  ","Steve Bryne","","And let me just add, if we are successful in negotiations, which we sure hope everyone can reach a negotiated settlement on all of this, you won't necessarily have to wait until a quarterly BLRA filing to get that information.  If it happened in between those, as it likely will, we might end up just doing a briefing for the commission of having it in a special update filing with them.  ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Okay, fair enough, but just so I understand the cadence, you would get something back from them?  Again, you've finished your negotiations, then you get something back from them, there's some internal analysis that you're doing.  You not, I think you've said several times here, you've not decided on scenario three, you'd be looking at those.  So if you got those costs or got that information from Westinghouse Shaw, you know, two days before BLAA filing it's not going to be in that BLRA filing, I assume it's going to be, again as you pointed out Steve, pushed out into either a special briefing or the following BLRA filing?","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, unless it was, the BLRA, the quarterly BLRA updates are really due 45 days after the end of the quarter.  So if there was something that was that material that happened in that interceding 45 days, again, depending on when those 45 days had transpired we might be able to put it in that previous BLRA quarterly update.     ","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","","Perfect, that's great.  Thanks for the help.","Jimmy Addision","","Yes, sure.  ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Andy Levi of Caris.  Please go ahead. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Hi, good afternoon.  Can you hear me? ","Jimmy Addison","","Sure. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Okay, good.  Just a couple questions.  This one, I think I missed, I think you answered already, but the 188 million, that would just flow through the BLRA or you\u2019d have to actually have \u2013 actually, not the BLRA, that would have to flow through a separate filing, right, is that correct? ","Steve Bryne","","It would be a separate update filing to the public service commission, but again, included under the BLRA. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","But that would be CapEx though, if you know, we ended up incurring an extra charge in that and the commission approves it, that would be CapEx, it wouldn\u2019t be\u2026 ","Steve Bryner","","That\u2019s right. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","\u2026write-off or anything.  And then\u2026 ","Jimmy Addison","","No, we\u2019re not building it for any purpose other than to serve customers. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Right, I understand.  And then of the 188, is there a breakdown, like how much is bedrock, how much are other issues? ","Steve Bryne","","We\u2019d haven\u2019t broken that down just because we\u2019re still in negoiations with the consortium so we wanted \u2013 they had asked to \u2013 for us to include all of these things that were open items on the table at the time we wanted to negotiate the COL Delay study, and so we\u2019re going to respect their \u2013 the negotiating process of both parties.  We put the bond on it, but I don\u2019t want to break it out just yet. ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","And I guess what I\u2019m a little confused about, maybe you guys are too, is I guess part of the delay, I mean, bedrock is bedrock, but wasn\u2019t part of the delay because of the design certification taking longer on Westinghouse\u2019s part? ","Steve Bryne","","Yes.  I guess that\u2019s kind of part of the negotiation.  That\u2019s the reason for the dispute.  ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Okay, I hear you on that one.  Okay, and then on the modules, can you give us any specific, like which pieces or which parts that are being constructed had issues?  ","Steve Bryne","","Well, the modules are largely structural modules that form the buildings of the new plant and these will be modules that generally are going to go in the inside of the containment vessel and outside that form parts of the auxiliary building, fuel handling building, those kinds of things.  They have had to redesign a number of those based on their discussions with the NRC Regulatory Commission around DCD Revision 19.  So it really is \u2013 their claim anyway is that they NCR Regulatory Commission, to satisfy them, they\u2019ve had to make changes to this design.  So that, you know, without getting into specifics, so we\u2019ve got a number of modules; the first one, for example, we expect to show up on site, it\u2019s a module that\u2019s called CA20, which is a relatively large, it weighs about 2 million pounds, it\u2019s about the size of a 7-story building.  We\u2019ll get that in 72 different subassemblies and we will put it together on site.  But it\u2019s those 72 subassemblies to CA20 being fabricated at the SMS facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  They\u2019ve had t make some changes to those structural modules; supports, materials, those kinds of things.  ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Okay, and then I guess as you kind of look at your EPC contract with Shaw, is there any other things that we kind of just need to keep an eye out for over the next couple of years that could arise similar to the claims that were made by Shaw on the 188 million, I mean, whether it\u2019s bedrock or other type of things or is that kind of unpredictable?  ","Steve Bryne","","Well, it\u2019s unpredictable but I think a lot of those are probably bias.  For example, you know, you take core bores to try to characterize what the bedrock looks like underneath, you know, between 20 and 40 feet of earth, and this one depression in the bedrock just happened to be between two core bores.  So you know, that\u2019s something that Shaw could not have known about, so that is probably more legitimate than anything else.  They\u2019re going to take some concrete and fill that in, is really what the issue is there. ","With regard to the change that they\u2019ve had to do, the design changes they\u2019ve had to do to things like the modules, with the approval of the certified design for the AP1000 Revision 19, which came in December, they are past those design issues.  So I would anticipate that those kind of things would be far less significant going forward as a certified design is approved.  ","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Co.","Okay, thank you, guys.

Slide 9, which shows the regulatory returns, rate based numbers are as of September 30, 2011 as well?

The only exception to that, Ashar, would be the new nuclear, the second one.  That\u2019s of the mid-year filing in 2011, that\u2019s more like June 30.  And I mentioned in my script we had 156 million of additional QUIP subsequent to that date. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","So June 30, 2011.  Okay. ","Jimmy Addison","","Right.  And all the others are September 30. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  And then if I can just go to this new CapEx slide that you have kind of given us on Page 10, could you tell us, I know from the last slide that we had, your new nuclear builds CapEx, if I\u2019m right, I\u2019m just \u2013 sorry, I\u2019m going back and forth, was something like 478 in \u201911 and you said you came in shy of that.  Can you tell us what exactly new nuclear spend was in 2011, please? ","Jimmy Addison","","I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips, Ashar, but I can tell you in 2012, we increased $90 million and it\u2019s principally those items that were pushed from \u201911 into \u201912.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay, so all the 90 million increase in \u201912 is all because of the \u2013 from going from \u201911 to \u201912?  ","Jimmy Addison","","Right. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  And then could you just help us, the 60, I guess million increase in \u201913, what is driving that? ","Jimmy Addison","","That\u2019s about 40 million increase and the majority of that, you see the separate line we added for estimated additional owner\u2019s costs, so that\u2019s the portion of the 150 million Steve discussed earlier that falls in \u201913 and \u201914.  So the majority of the increase is driven from those additional owner\u2019s costs that we\u2019ll be filing for.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  And Jimmy, can I just ask you, the \u2013 now, of course, having known where you are in 2011, which you said you came exactly around your target, and with decoupling and with the BLRA and with the, if I\u2019m right, would you tell us on Slide 9, right, there are no regulatory things to do in 2012, right, except for the BLRA filing.  Am I right?  There\u2019s no regulatory rate case going on as part of this process? ","Jimmy Addison","","No, not as in a base-rate case.  I mean, there\u2019s always a variety of matters; there\u2019s our annual fuel review for electric fuel, there\u2019s our demand side management file, we\u2019ve got a variety of items that are more, I\u2019ll call them annual repetitive type things.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  So then this comes by big question.  We don\u2019t \u2013 we are not impacted by weather.  We are not impacted by, I guess, sales of such, right because we have [inaudible].  Why do we \u2013 can you just remind us again why we have such a wide range as part of the process? ","Jimmy Addison","","For our guidance for 2012? ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Yes. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay, but in Georgia Reg, we do have a new contact here, right, so the only exposure in Georgia is, I guess, what, a rate, is that correct? ","Jimmy Addison","Well, that\u2019s kind of over simplifying.  That\u2019s a very dynamic market and that market changes a lot.  Over the last two years it\u2019s moved the majority  of more than half of the customers are moving to fixed-price contracts.  So it\u2019s an over simplification to say the only thing on the margin is weather.  ","But we do estimate and I said earlier in my comments that estimate 22 to $0.24 a share in Georgia.  So you know, we\u2019ll feel pretty good about that.  But if you step back and say, $0.20 a share on $3.17 of earnings, I mean, that\u2019s still 6, 7% range.  To me that\u2019s not that broad. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Understood.  And can you just remind us, I apologize, I probably didn\u2019t go through the thing.  How much did we earn in Georgia in this year, 2011? ","Jimmy Addison","","About $0.19. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","About $0.19.  Okay.  ","Jimmy Addison","","We had a mild early part of the year and the mild December.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  And then just, if I can, just going back to Slide 9, right, I\u2019m just trying to do a theoretical, I can just take the rate base of the new nuclear and multiply it with the equity ratio and the 11% ROE to kind of say, hey, this is what earnings are on a dollar basis coming from the new nuclear?  Right?  Is that a fair thing? ","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, I think that\u2019s fair.  As I said earlier, I mean, that\u2019s really simplifying the calculation.  I had not thought about it like that before, but I think that\u2019s fair.  It should be covering the debt one for one, right?  I mean, that\u2019s the assumption we\u2019re making in that, but we\u2019ll think about that and maybe provide something at maybe our analyst day on that. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","But Jimmy, just one more question if I can end up with.  Would debt cost coming in much lower, does that help us or hurt us? ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, the incremental debt costs that \u2013 the bond deal, for example, that we did in January at SCE&G was new money.  So even though it\u2019s at 4.2, 4.3%, that\u2019s a historically low rate.  It\u2019s still a new 4.3% on 250 million dollars.  So it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s additional interest cost on a weighted average basis it will pull down the debt portfolio, weighted average debt cost somewhat, but there\u2019s still more debt out there, more interest to pay.  ","Steve Bryne","","And it\u2019s covered by the BLRA. ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Right, but this is what I don\u2019t know.  Does the BLRA get updated for capital costs?  That part, it doesn\u2019t.  So the equity rate results are fixed in it and that ratio is also \u2013 debt costs are also fixed in it.  Am I right? ","Jimmy Addison","","No.  The equity rate of 11% of 6, the cap structure is updated each time we file.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","What about the debt cost, the debt rate? ","Jimmy Addison","","It\u2019s updated.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","The debt rate is also updated? ","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, the only thing that\u2019s fixed is the return on equity of 11%.  ","Ashar Khan \u2013 Visium","Okay.  Thank you so much. ","Jimmy Addison","","You\u2019re welcome. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock.  Please go ahead. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good afternoon.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Hello, Paul. ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","How are you doing?  All my questions have been answered except just \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this, when we talk about customer usage, I know there was some weather impacts for the year and stuff, but just what are you seeing there?  How has that been changing?  I know the unemployment rate seems to be getting better and what have you, but what are you \u2013 can you just give us a little bit of a flavor as to what you\u2019re seeing? ","Jimmy Addison","","Yes, for the year as a whole, \u201911 versus \u201910, weather normalized usage for residential and industrial was up less than 1% but commercial was down a couple of percentage.  As I said in my comments earlier, you know, industrial has got to lead, there have to be jobs out there for folks to have confidence to start spending money at home.  And then that\u2019s got to translate ultimately into more commercial business.  So I think we\u2019re seeing that on the industrial and residential side, but it\u2019s not translated to the commercial side yet.  To me, the kind of wild card in this, we saw this impact several years ago, I think for our industry is what happens to gasoline prices this summer.  I heard a report this morning that gasoline prices could hit an all-time high this summer.  And if they do, that\u2019s money straight off of the discretionary income of every household.  And that can have a significant impact, that can cause a concern over demand.  You know, I hope those reports don\u2019t prove to be true, but certainly, as natural gas has come down, we\u2019ve not seen \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the inverse of that in petroleum.  ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, and then just the less than 1%, just to clarify, that is customer usage, that\u2019s not involving customer growth or, that\u2019s usage per customer we\u2019re talking about? ","Jimmy Addison","","That\u2019s right.  We were \u2013 I\u2019m personally \u2013 we had planned a little more pessimistically than that and we were, you know, it\u2019s a little bit of an optimistic message that we\u2019ve now seen a couple of quarters in a row that translated into a full year, year over year of increased usage, weather normalized, net of the growth of additional number of customers.  ","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Right.  Well, all my other questions were answered.  Thanks a lot.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Sure.  ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin.  Please go ahead. ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Hi.  Good afternoon.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Hello. ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","First, I was wondering if you could just update me on a couple of 2011 numbers.  The first, the CapEx and then second the cash from operations?  Do you have those? ","Jimmy Addison","","Dan, I do not have those.  We will \u2013 those will be filed in our 10-K in two weeks.  ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Okay.  And second, I was wondering, you know, you\u2019d mentioned \u2013 someone else asked a little bit about the industrial gas sales in the quarter.  You know, they were up 20%.  I was wondering if you could give a little more color on the particular, you know, is that driven by chemical or new \u2013 a new plant coming on, or you know, that seems like a pretty big jump in the quarter. ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, some of that\u2019s in transportation.  I mean, when customers that buy interrupt gas, if they, you know the price of natural gas coming down like it has, when they had the opportunity to run on alternate fuels, and they can switch to natural gas, they\u2019re switching.  In addition to that, we\u2019ve got customers that are calling us now that do not operate on natural gas that are interested in getting natural gas supply in the future because of the low price compared to their current fuels.  So I just think you\u2019re seeing that really driven off the price of natural gas, you\u2019re just seeing much more driven off that. ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Well, is that something then that going forward, you think we\u2019ll be dependent on the price \u2013 the gas prices as opposed to just based demand in the service territory or how should we think about that? ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, I think it\u2019s both.  I mean, I think certainly the economy as a whole and what they need to produce in their relative businesses, it\u2019s going to drive \u2013 obviously drive their production.  Then the price of gas compared to their other choices of fuel is going to drive which choice they make in their fuel source.  So I really don\u2019t think you can separate the two although they\u2019re \u2013 I don\u2019t think you can say it\u2019s just one over the other, both are included.  ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Okay.  And then I was curious, you know, with the new EPA rules on mercury and all that coming out, if you have any comment on how that will impact?  It doesn\u2019t look like there\u2019s a lot of CapEx related to environmental in your budget.  How should we think about the environmental rules? ","Jimmy Addison","","I think we spent quite a bit of money in the last few years on environmental and getting our largest coal-fired stations, scrubbers, SCRs, baghouses so that about 70% of our coal fleet is now fully scrubbed with SCRs and baghouses.  So from a compliance perspective, we think those larger plants will meet all of the known EPA rules and regulations.  Obviously, we can\u2019t comment on what we don\u2019t yet know.  ","The phase-in period, we were heartened by, particularly with things like the mercury and air toxins rule with three years plus basically.  It has been know that if you ask for an additional year of implementation of a statewide basis, it will likely be granted.  So with the four-year phase-in and most of our plants compliant, we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape on the known rules.  ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Okay, and then the last thing I was curious about was, you know, you saw 6% - I mean, a $0.06 pickup based on the lower O&M in the quarter.  I wonder if you could give a little more color on what drove that and if that\u2019s the way to expect going forward? ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, we\u2019ve had a constant focus on cost control, significantly stepped up during this recession. I think we\u2019ve really got our hands and our culture around that.  I think our \u2013 if you look over the last several years, it\u2019s not just a quarterly trend, but the fourth quarter there was a fairly significant number there.  Frankly, some of that was driven by some of our incentive comp that\u2019s earnings driven.  We did not hit our internal target, so we did not \u2013 we will not be paying out a portion of that related to that incentive.   Some of our incentive comp is driven by the performance of the stock, did not reach targeted levels.  Frankly, after Fukushima, the stock took quite a shot, so we did not hit some of those.  So some of that is related to the accruals or incentive comp, but they\u2019re just a hodgepodge of other items in there too.  ","But what you \u2013 what you can count on in 2012 is a targeted O&M that\u2019s flat with 2011 and that\u2019s our goal. ","Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin ","Okay, thank you and good luck on COL. ","Jimmy Addison","","Thank you. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from (Usman Aragondia of Catopal Capital).  ","(Usman Aragondia \u2013 Catopal Capital)","Hi, guys.  Great call.  My question has already been asked, so I appreciate it.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Sure.  Thank you. ","Operator","","And our final question will come from Tim Winter of Gabelli & Company.  Please go ahead. ","Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Co. ","Good afternoon, guys, and thanks for sticking around a little longer than an hour.  Hopefully, I\u2019ll be quick.  ","I\u2019m just wondering, Jim, can you clarify that 2012 guidance is based on diluted shares versus \u201911 which was basic? ","Jimmy Addison","","No, they\u2019re both based on basic.  We have to do this diluted capitalization to comply with the accounting pronouncements, but we\u2019re not going to pull the equity down until the later part of the year, so we base our guidance on basic earnings. ","Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Co. ","Okay, and then the financing plan, that assumes 50% bonus depreciation, would there be any impact if we \u2013 we\u2019re at another year of 100%? ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, there might be some fine tuning around it, but frankly, we would have to put that in consideration in conjunction with the discussion Steve was having earlier around the COL negotiations, the change orders, that type of things.  So you\u2019ve got to put all that in, you\u2019ve got some things possibly going off different directions.  ","Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Co. ","Okay, and then finally, looking at the Appendage 2 of your BLRA filing, early \u201912 and \u201913 are the heaviest CapEx years.  I assume \u2013 and they decline, you know, pretty significantly in \u201915 and \u201916. I\u2019m assuming those will be the heaviest rate increase years?  And as you\u2019re thinking about \u2013 or as we\u2019re thinking about when you file a base-rate case for the non-nuclear part of the company, what sort of level or rate BLRA increase are we looking at in \u201912 and \u201913?  Are we still under 5% annual rate increase? ","Jimmy Addison","","Yes.  I think that\u2019s in the ballpark.  I mean, of course that\u2019s also dependent upon what kind of change in the CapEx there is as a result of these negotiations, as a result of the COL delay study of delaying the first new unit and accelerating the third new unit.  We\u2019ve got to get all of that information form the consortium before we really understand that and the impact on rates.  ","But overall, we originally, when we originally filed for the approval of the plants and they were approved, we\u2019re projecting about a 2 1\/2% average increase and now it\u2019s less than that, principally because of inflation being less than we expected.  So yeah, it\u2019s going to \u2013 by pushing these out and compacting the period, it\u2019s definitely going to drive up the peak, but the average increase is lower than we originally projected because the overall cost is lower than we originally projected.  ","Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Co. ","Okay, thank, guys.  ","Jimmy Addison","","Sure. ","Operator","","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session.  I would like to turn the question back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing comments. ","Jimmy Addison","","Well, thank you.  And just to summarize, we\u2019re very pleased with our results for 2011, which were in line with our guidance and we\u2019re optimistic about 2012.  Our nuclear strategy continues to move forward as expected in all areas with the progress of construction and licensing to execution of the plant financings and the BLRA increases each year.  We believe 2012 will be an exciting year, as we anticipate receiving the COL and we look forward to further economic recovery in our service territory.  And we thank you for your interest in SCANA.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Susan Wright","","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2014.","Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer for SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic update and information regarding customer growth and usage as well as regulatory activity. Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions.","The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com. Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that contains a further link to project news and updates. In connection with this process we had discontinued our practice of furnishing on Form 8-K, the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports on the SCANA website.","Please note that we have recently added another investor information link to the yellow box.

The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy. ","Jimmy E. Addison","","Thanks, Susan, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide three. Basic earnings in the second quarter of 2014 were $0.68 per share compared to $0.60 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Please note that the electric weather normalization pilot ended in December 2013, and the Company\u2019s financials are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business.","Accordingly, the improved results in the second quarter are attributable to increases in electric margins due to abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase, and customer growth along with higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx related items including property taxes and share dilution.","Now please turn to Slide four. Basic earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2014, were $2.05 versus $1.73 in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program.","Now, I'd like to speak about our operation and maintenance expenses for the year. As we previously mentioned, a strategic goal going forward will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We estimated O&M would grow approximately 3% in 2014, and we continue to have confidence in that estimate. Please note under provisions of a regulatory order related to our DSM programs, we reduced second quarter O&M by $5 million, so year-to-date we're very close to our plan.","Now on Slide five, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's second quarter 2014 earnings denoted in blue were up $0.07 compared to 2013, driven largely by increases in electric margins, which were due primarily to $0.06 of abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase, and customer growth as well as higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses as well as expenses related to our capital program, including property taxes, depreciation, and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.28 due primarily to higher electric margins.","PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings for the second quarter of 2014, shown in red, increased $0.01 per share over the second quarter of 2013 primarily due to increased margins from customer growth. For the six-months period ended June 30, shown in red, basic earnings were also up $0.01 per share consistent with the quarter.","SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green reported a seasonal loss for the second quarter of $0.02 per share consistent with the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date earnings are $0.13 per share compared to $0.14 per share in the prior year. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014 consistent with the second quarter of the prior year. For the six-months period these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.08 in 2014 compared to $0.04 in 2013.","I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide six. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $400 million with expectations of creating over 4,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic and finished its June 2014 fiscal year with container volume up 8% over 2013. As I've mentioned in the past, it's estimated that one in every five jobs in South Carolina is related to port volume. This increased traffic is a very good sign for the local economy.","At the bottom of the slide you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 5.3%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.8%.","Slide seven presents customer growth in electric sales. On top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates as of the end of June are 1.4% and 2.3%, respectively. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina also added customers at a 2.3% rate.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt-hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2014. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were up 0.5% on a 12 month ended basis. Now please turn to slide eight which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of a regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The non-GAAP earned return for the 12 months ended June 30 in the electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% for higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. We have had incremental CWIP in the last year of approximately $595 million, and as Steve will discuss shortly, we filed our latest request for advised rates back in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We are allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns. SCE&G's gas business returns are measured each year through the Rate Stabilization Act. We expect a small decrease effective November 1 to adjust the ROE to 10.25%. This decrease should be approximately $3 million on an annual basis.","Slide nine presents our CapEx forecast which has not changed from what was presented in Analyst Day. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed in May. At the bottom of the slide, is our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Now, please turn to slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018 which has also not changed since our presentation at Analyst Day. On May 27 of this year, SCE&G issued $300 million of 50-year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we continue to target 52% to 54% equity levels that the operating company, SCE&G.","While we estimate incremental equity issuances of $425 million above the 401(k) DRIP proceeds, its unlikely that the issuances will occur exactly as presented in the slide. We have not decided how or when these additional equity financings will occur as they are subject to the changes in the funding needs for planned project expenses. However, based on cash flows to date, and planned construction payments, it is getting less likely that we will need to issue any equity in 2014 to meet our targeted cap structure.","Now on Slide 11, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.45 to $3.65 basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.55 per share. Weather has obviously contributed significantly to earnings year-to-date. We will reevaluate our guidance after the third quarter, our most significant quarter for electric earnings. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next three to five year period. We continue to estimate that our effective tax rate for 2014 will be approximately 32%.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne ","Thanks Jimmy. I\u2019d like to begin by discussing some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Please turn to slide 12, which presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site that was taken back in May. In the middle you can see the Heavy Lift Derrick or HLD and the track that it uses to travel 360 degrees in a circle.","The Unit 2 and Unit 3 excavations can be seen to the left and the right of the HLD. In the upper right hand section of the slide you can see some of the cooling towers. Cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are structure complete and we are working on conduit power cables and other commodities now. Just where the cooling tower is you can see the Module Assembly Building or MAB where the Unit 2 module CA-20 was recently completed and moved out and where assembly of Module CA-01 is currently taking place. Since this photo was taken there have been some significant changes in the nuclear island for both of these units and as we discussed on our analyst day event and I will recap shortly.","On Slide 13, you can see pictures of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. In the upper left hand corner, you can see the containment vessel lower bowl that was placed inside the CR-10 Module or support cradle. In early May, we placed CA-20, at roughly 2 million pound structural Module using the Heavy Lift Derrick.","On the right hand side of the slide, you can see it placed next to the containment vessel lower bowl. On the bottom left of the slide you can see where the first ring section of the containment vessel was set on the lower bowl. This ring section weighs approximately 900 tons and is made of 1.75-inch thick steel. Here, you can also see the large equipment hatch openings. The smaller openings are personal hatches.","On slide 14, you can see pictures of the Unit 3 nuclear island. On the left of the slide, you can see where the CR-10 module was built on the base mat. On the right side of the slide, you can see the containment vessel lower bowl has now been set. Slide 15 shows a schematic of the turbine building that illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when completed. All of these modules have now been placed in their final locations.","Turning to slide 16, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide you can see all the previously mentioned modules have been completed and placed on the turbine building base mat, as well as progress being made on the structural steel for the surrounding turbine building itself. On slide 17, you can see a Feedwater heater being placed inside the condenser. Slide 18 shows the turbine building basement. A condensate pumps, strain coolers, and circling water outlets from the cooling towers are clearly visible.","Slide 19, shows a few of the components that have arrived on site. On the top left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 generator stator [rotationary] component. The generator converts the mechanical energy from the turbine rotation into electrical energy. On the top right, you see the Unit 2 main transformer sometimes referred to as the generator step-up transformer, or GSU. This transformer increases the voltage from the main generator to the 230,000 volts that you find in the switch yard.","On the bottom left, you see the Unit 2 Core Makeup tank which is a part of the passive cooling system. On the bottom right, you see Unit 2 water boxes. Cooling water flows into these water boxes and then through the condenser tubes to cool exhaust steam from the turbine.","Slide 20, shows more components arriving on the site. Left hand side is the integrated reactor head package which allows for rapid removal during refueling. Top right shows auxiliary transformers, and bottom right are the non-safety related diesel generators. These diesel generators are supplied but are not needed to mitigate an accident.","On slide 21, you can see even more arrivals on-site by rail. These are the Unit 3 turbine casings. On slide 22, you can see a picture of the Sanmen plant in China from back in May. At this point they are approximately two years ahead of us in construction. Here you can see both of their AP1000 really starting to take shape.","On slide 23, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 as reflected in the May 2014 Base Load Review Act, or BLRA, quarterly report. As you can see the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases onto the BLRA and are associated with the right hand axis. As we stated during our last call, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.","Please now turn to Slide 24. As discussed at Analyst Day, we filed our BLRA quarterly status update for the first quarter of 2014 in May as well as our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. The Office of Regulatory Staff has completed their review of our request and is recommending to the Commission a $66.2 million revenue increased, or a rate increase of about 2.82%. We concur with their recommendation and anticipate the request in increase in rates effective November 1.","On slide 25 you'll see a breakout of total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see the project costs as filed in the May 2014 BLRA report. Project costs are currently under running the original approval received from the Public Service Commission in South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to the lower escalation. That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","Hi, actually it's Mike Weinstein. How are you doing?","Steve Byrne","Hi, Mike good.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","Hey could you, I noticed that the slide that usually talks about the different modules, their expected [on-hook] dates is not in the slide deck. I'm just wondering if you can provide an update on that.","Stephen A. Byrne","Sure. This is Steve. As we've said before, we're awaiting a new integrated project schedule from the consortium. We anticipate that yet this quarter, and until we get that, I don't want to put out dates that I might have to revise once again. We're waiting for those dates to come back in before we start revising any of those charts.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 UBS","Got it. In terms of the equity, the equity needs and the fact that the possibility that you might not have to issue any equity this year, is that related more to the strong weather-related results this year? Or is it more because of delayed spending? What's the factor there?","Jimmy E. Addison"," ","It's a combination of both, Michael. I'd say it's probably a slightly more related to the construction schedule than it is the weather, but certainly both are big contributors.","Mike Weinstein \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thank you very much. ","Operator","The next question is from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Good, afternoon. Thanks.","Jimmy E. Addison","Sure.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","This is really a follow on to that second question, somewhat, I was wondering if you could quantify the amount of cash that you've gotten from those weather benefits, and how that would play into those equity needs. Is it as simple as taking the incremental earnings there and multiplying it in shares outstanding, or is there some way to quantify the cash?","Jimmy E. Addison","No. It's pretty straightforward like that. It's basically the earnings per share times the shares outstanding, but I'll kind of make that easy for you. It's about $35 million or so year-to-date. And of course you'd have to net it of tax, given the slight difference in timing of when you pay the taxes, but that part of the loan is roughly $20 million.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. That is when you talk about the weather not being a complete reason for the delay in the equity issuance; it's a relatively small amount?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right. I would say, I've been saying for quite a while, that if we didn't need equity in 2014 at the earliest it would be the end of the year. This is not a radical change in the message.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Great. Then on the escalation cost, what's the big driver there that's been taking that down so much relative to the expectation?","Stephen A. Byrne","Our escalation is tied to an index, and when we had our Base Load Review Act hearings back in 2008 we had to specify the index. We picked a Handy-Whitman index, and it just continues to come back lower each six-month update.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Is that an inflation type issue, or is there something else?","Stephen A. Byrne","It's low inflation, but it really looks at costs specifically by sector. Then one of the indices we use is specific to nuclear. It's just a reflection of the fact that the terrible economy or the rebound from that economy has not resulted in high inflation. Early on, it was the impact of the poor economy, and now we're not seeing a rebound in inflation. So far it's been a very positive impact on the project.","Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from Andy Levi of Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Hey guys, how are you?","Jimmy E. Addison","Good, Andy.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Just two quick questions, one is fairly simple. In the first quarter, you had given like quarterly numbers as far as sales. In this quarter, you didn't. Is it possible to get this, on the weather normalized basis, residential, commercial, industrial sales, the actual growth?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. We have traditionally just offered the 12 month moving average because it tends to take some of that volatility out. We did provide that for the first quarter just for the quarter. I would say for just the residential, if we looked at it alone for the just for the quarter, it was down about twice of what the 12 month moving average is, just continuing to show that volatility. So we had a couple of quarters where it's been up. This quarter it's been down a little, and this just continues to show that volatility out there. Overall, it was down about 1% for the quarter, but we prefer and we pay attention internally to the 12 month moving average.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","That's weather normalized that you're talking about?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right. Yes.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","I remember the first quarter you had the weather was so weird in the first quarter, it's hard to figure out what the real weather normalized number is.","Jimmy E. Addison","It's a little weird in the second quarter too. It was over 40% higher than the normal cooling degree days in the quarter. We had cold first quarter and a hot second quarter.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Okay. Here, we didn't experience that. You're not that far away.","Jimmy E. Addison","Right.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Then the second question, I don't know if Steve wants to answer it, and I asked certainly the same question. So I -- as I said, I apologize for the question, but just kind to need to ask anyway. With CBI, we've noticed stock has come down quite a bit on various research reports relative to their finances. And I'm just curious what your thoughts are on that, and not specifically on their finances but just whether we should be concerned, or you have any concerns on the financial health of CBIs. The stock's off like 35% in the last two months, and whether you've had any discussions relative to making sure everything's already, and whether it has affected operations at all.","Jimmy E. Addison","Let me understand, Andy. You're saying I have a choice as to whether or not answer the question?","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","I didn't say choice. You can always have a choice whether to answer the question. I feel bad about asking it, but just feel that I need to.","Stephen A. Byrne","I can only tell you what we see on the project level. I can't really speak to their financing, their stock price. What we see at the project level is a continued commitment to do whatever it is they need to do to rectify the situation that we've gotten into with modular deliveries and including outsourcing of some of those modules for the second unit to other places which obviously is going to increase their costs in those modules. So they're doing the right things from our perspective, and we haven't seen any impact at the site level.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","So operationally, everything is good?","Stephen A. Byrne","That's correct.","Andy Levi - Avon Capital","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Hey Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Hello Jim.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","","How are you?","","Jimmy E. Addison","Just fine.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","I have a couple of questions. First one is there are two softballs, okay? The first one is on this pension legislation that's weaving its way through Congress. For those who are fully funded, there's an ability to take out some cash. Does that affect you if it actually becomes law? Do you know?","Jimmy E. Addison","I do not know the answer to that, but I highly doubt that we would plan to take any cash related to that. We're in a situation where our plan is fully funded as you're alluding to. We've got a strategy to continue to derisk that plan over the next several years by moving more into the fixed over the next several years, so we're satisfied. We're pleased with where we are.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. And the second question relates to the whole schedule with the resolution of this construction consortium dispute. I thought originally you guys might come out with updated timing and how that resolution was on or around September 30. Is that still a good date?","Stephen A. Byrne","I think what we said is that we anticipate the consortium coming to us with the schedule this quarter, and that that would kick off for us a negotiation process, both on the duration of the schedule and their means and methods. So what I think they're going to be looking for from us is, here's how we see it going from here on, out based on all of the factors we've seen so far, modular deliveries, craft productivity, other supply chain issues, weather, whatever you want to factor in, and then say, does this look reasonable? And you know based on your experience, are there things that we could change in order to yet expedite the schedule? I haven't seen it yet. I anticipate seeing it soon, but again that's going to kick off a negotiation base for us, so I wouldn't call it final until we're finished with that negotiation.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","I'm a little confused. So negotiations have not started, right? Steve?","Stephen A. Byrne","That's correct. ","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. Then you're going to be silent until you have a final deal in hand with them? Or are you going to give us some metrics along the way that you're either entering negotiations, or here's what they're proposing and now we're entering negotiations? Just so we can book end this issue.","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. I think, one, it's going to depend on what I see from them. Then we're going to be working on if they give me something I don't like, what could be the possible cost implications of that? Then what mitigation things could they propose, or we propose? That's what I mean by the negotiations, and again, I expect to get it this quarter. Will we go silent? I don't know that I'm going to be discussing it until I see it's going to be more final, but if we have any kind of disclosure issues that might crop out of this, obviously as soon as we think something is solid, even if we don't have something fully negotiated, we'll disclose it.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","I'm just thinking out loud here, but if they come back instead of being a $200 million dispute, pick a number, $400 million, does that change in terms of, is that disclosure issue right away for you guys, that you'd have to say the dispute number is now $400 million or something? Just so we can understand what's going on?","Stephen A. Byrne","From a disclosure perspective I think what we'd have to do is we'd have to evaluate whether we think that's a real number or not. Remember, we put the $200 million number out there, not that was a consortium number. That was just our estimate of the delay that they gave us on the commercial operation dates. I think it was just prior to our Analyst Day last year. That would have been about June on 2013.","So with this new fully integrated project schedule, they're factoring a lot more things in. They're even looking at engineering completion. They're factoring in assistance they might get from outside, parent company like Toshiba for Westinghouse, for example. That's what I anticipate they're going to give me, and when I first see it, I'm just not going to be in a position to say, here it is. I want to, one, digest it, and two, see if we agree. So what I anticipate is, what a contractor will typically do, is they'll give you something that's out of bounds, and anticipating that you'll negotiate something different. I don't think it's going to be any different than that.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay, but do you think it will be, and I hate to use the term, kitchen sink meaning they'll give you everything at this time, instead of piecemeal? Is that what you're expecting, at least, that's your expectation? ","Stephen A. Byrne","I think on the schedule, they'll give me everything. We may have some decisions to make at that point as to paths we may go down, mitigation paths we may go down. Any kind of a cost implication, one, it would have to be negotiated, and two, it might depend on which path we choose.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay.","Stephen A. Byrne","I'm not trying to deliberately avoid answering the question, but it is a dynamic situation. I've got to see what I have to start with. I anticipate that before the end of the quarter, and then we'll have our team evaluate it along with their team, and we'll negotiate to something final. I'd love to be able to say, we'll have that on X date, but I just don't know what X date is.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. Then just \u2013 I guess the last question with all this, sorry to beat this to death, once you get that, what's the process mechanically? Going to the Commission for approval, the new costs, whatever they might be, how does all that work?","Stephen A. Byrne","Under the Base Load Review Act, we can go back in annually just with an update on the project, and that will be on ex [parte] fashion. If we have a change to the approved schedule or cash flows, then we would go in with a filing. We'd make a filing before the Commission, and it would be a full-fledged hearing before our Public Service Commission.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay. Then an expected timeline, how long do you think that would take?","Stephen A. Byrne","Generally, from the time we file, it will be a few months before the hearing. Then I can't remember if, ordinarily let's say if it were a rate case, it's six months from the time we file to the time they have to render an opinion. I'm not certain as we sit here whether that's the case for the Base Load Review Act or not, but generally they don't deviate from that too much.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Will that be a separate proceeding to the BLRA review with the annual cost, to be rolled into the 2015 recovery petition?","Stephen A. Byrne","Remember, that when you say annual cost, we just give an ex parte briefing to the Commission if we're not asking for anything additional.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","Okay.","Stephen A. Byrne","If we were to go in, we might roll our ex parte briefing into that case in which case we wouldn't go back again, but we will make an ex parte briefing at some point this year because we haven't done it yet. If we decide we need to make a filing, and that's this year, we could roll it in. If it rolls into next year, then we'll do the ex parte this year, and we'll do the filing next year.","Jimmy E. Addison","Jim, let me add, if you're asking if it's separate from our annual BLRA rate request and the increase each November, yes, it'd be separate from that.","Jim von Riesemann - CRT Capital","That's the question I was asking. Okay. Thanks, guys. I appreciate the time.","Jimmy E. Addison","Sure.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Hey, good afternoon. Just a couple questions on the near-term trends, first of all, how has the weather in July been shaping up for you down there?","Jimmy E. Addison","It was rather warm the first part of the month, and then abnormally cool the latter part. Overall, just anecdotally, it's been fairly normal, but you wouldn't have thought that if you were here at any one point in time.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay. The reason I ask is because when I look at the year-to-date trend and the rolling 12 months, I'm a little surprised that you're still sticking with the internal target of $3.55 rather than moving that toward the higher end. Are there any specific items in the second half that might be a drag year-over-year, or is that just being conservative?","Jimmy E. Addison","The only thing is that the summer quarter, this third quarter, is the peaking quarter in the electric business. We get that quarter on our belt before we ever consider reevaluating those targets.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Sure. Okay. Then in terms of the equity of $100 million for this year, did the original guidance range assume that would be later in the year as you've described, or would it be the guidance range assuming more of a distribution throughout the year?","Jimmy E. Addison","No. It's the former. It presumed an end-of-year issuance, so it had very little effect if anything on the weighted average shares outstanding and therefore on the EPS.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay. Now, if that doesn't get pulled before the end of the calendar year, should we assume that would be an additional $100 million early next year? Or would that be lowered by the amount of this year benefiting from weather, and whatever else might be driving you towards the higher end of guidance?","Jimmy E. Addison","First, let me say it's all dependent upon all of these questions that have been asked of Steve earlier. So if there's an impact from the construction schedule and timing of construction payments, it will certainly impact the CapEx and therefore the financing. But if it's moved into 2015, and everything else were consistent, it would be probably in addition to $15 million.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Okay.","Jimmy E. Addison","Instead of $125 million in 2015, $225 million.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","Got it. Okay. Then lastly just on the usage, it's been pretty consistent, the 12 months average of about 0.5% weather adjusted versus the account growth of more like 1.25%. Any change in your view about the drag from conservation of energy efficiency?","Jimmy E. Addison","No. Not really. There's a lot of efficiency going on across the board from HVAC to CFL bulbs, etcetera, and our best estimates are that we're past the midpoint on the saturation of the CFL from the latest information I've seen, but those are estimates. We don't have a precise inventory obviously. I'd say we're moving past that point.","Customer growth continues to slowly tick up on new customers added. All the indications are around the economy that it continues to pick up from the industrial recruitment side, continued announcements that translate ultimately into jobs, and 12 to 36 months that translate into customer residential growth. We continue to feel good about those, and I guess no real view change on the efficiency outside of the light bulb standards.","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital","All right. Thanks a lot.","Jimmy E. Addison","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Good afternoon.","Jimmy E. Addison","Hello, Dan.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So I wanted to just follow up on what you were just talking about a little bit, given that you showed year-over-year customer growth in the electric side of 1.4%, yet it looks like per residential commercial the weather adjusted volume was still down like 0.75% to 1%. Is that kind of -- how should we think about that going forward? Is that kind of a new steady state or how will customer growth translate into volume growth?","Jimmy E. Addison","I think difficult to project that. That's why we've spoken consistently the last several quarters that we don't get too hung up when we have a good quarter or two in a row like we did in Q4 and Q1. We don't get too concerned when we see a slight downtick here in Q2 in that residential category specifically.","One other thing I would say is the last couple of quarters in particular have been extreme weather, extreme cold in Q1, extreme warm, over 40% cooling degree days above normal in Q2. That makes it difficult to really determine exactly how much of the margin change is due to weather and how much is due to non-weather-related consumption. I know one of the earlier questions was about, let's get precisely into Q2 numbers, etcetera, as to the margins, non-weather. It's really difficult to get that precise. We can put a number down to the right side of the decimal, but if you start drawing any long-term conclusions about that, all you can assure is that you're probably not going to hit it.","I'd just caution you to step back from that a little bit and try not to project a whole lot around it. What I do know is you look at those unemployment rates, that's real, and that's what usually translates into people's confidence is their personal budgets. We're real encouraged by what's going on with industrial recruitment and ultimately with jobs.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Related to the industrial, given the projects and activity you're seeing, do you expect the 3.7% area to be a reasonable growth rate for second half as well then?","Jimmy E. Addison","3.7%?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Industrial.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, our industrial base is very diverse. We don't have anything at more than 25% in any one sector. There's a lot that goes into that. That's not something you can just model and project it linearly, but each customer is unique, and we put together a plan based upon working with each of those industrials. It's hard to predict that. I wouldn't get that precise, on the 3.7%.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Going back to the nuclear build, so what are the key critical path items that you'll be working on in the third quarter here that we'll see, should anticipate talking about in October? Is it the CA-05 and CA-01, or what are the items we should be focused on?","Stephen A. Byrne","The modular construction of AP1000 units really has about six big, they call them the big six, structural modules, and that's the CA-01, 02, 03, 04, 05, and 20. So 20 was set, so the next big ones are going to be 05 and 01. 04 was set also. So 20 and 04 are behind us. So I think its 05, then 01, then 03. Those are the next things.","We're working on the ring sections for the containment vessel. We've placed one ring on top of the containment vessel, lower bowl for Unit 2, and we're working on ring sections for both Units 2 and 3. We will continue with those. We continue to receive parts and pieces from all over the world, received the Unit 3 and [wish] to separate re-heaters last week. Those parts continue to come in, and we're looking for where we're staging them, where we're storing them.","We continue to work the turbine building for Unit 2, and anticipate that at some point soon we'll pour the basemat for the turbine building for Unit 3. In general the Unit 3 stuff as you might expect is going a little bit better because we learned lessons on 2, and they get faster for 3, but the Unit 2 stuff is the critical modules that you talked about.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, just a couple questions, in your earnings release you don't give a balance sheet or cash flow statement. I'm just curious. If I look at slide 9 and the CapEx forecast for 2014, where are you year-to-date relative to that forecast, meaning that $1.5 billion number? Are you, you've spent almost half of that in the first six months of the year? Are you running north of that, south of that? I'm just trying to think through uses and sources of cash for the year.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Michael, I don't have the exact dollars in front of me, but we are slightly behind that CapEx budget. At this point I'd say probably about 10%. What I don't know right off hand is how it falls out in buckets by month or by quarter, but we're slightly behind that CapEx budget to date but not significantly.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. And that implies that on the nuclear component of it that $805 million, you're running it close to half of that level for the year-to-date?","Jimmy E. Addison","I just don't know that. We made the filing. You see down below, the 2014 number into the blue box at the bottom, says there's $595 million to occur by June 30 of that $805 million. We made our filing with the BLRA, and we ended up slightly less than that I think, so not a great deal of change there.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Very helpful. And just I want to make sure I understand some of the rate changes that are happening, so $66 million revenue increased tied to the BLRA that starts November of this year. Then the $3 million, I think you were talking about on the gas business, that's the SCE&G gas business, and it's a $3 million annualized rate decreased that starts in November?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Got it. Then last question, just trying to think about weather normalization, so second quarter I would assume all the uplift is on the electric side. The first quarter, is there a way to break apart how much of that weather benefit was North Carolina electric versus South Carolina electric versus maybe SCANA Energy and even South Carolina gas? ","Jimmy E. Addison","We don't have a North Carolina electric company. ","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","I live in North Carolina. You know what I meant. North Carolina gas. My [bet].","Jimmy E. Addison","There's not a significant amount. The mechanisms that we have in South Carolina gas account for weather normalization as well as the utilization tracker in North Carolina accounts for weather. So the short answer is very, very little would relate unless those mechanisms aren't completely 100% picking it all up, but that's the intention in the formulas, so really all of it was related to electric.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. That makes sense. Jimmy, thank you. I appreciate you taking the time. ","Jimmy E. Addison","You're welcome. ","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our next question is a follow up from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","Hi, it's Mike again. One last question about the cost estimates and the dispute, the $200 million that you were talking about how it could possibly be increased as a result of other things that might come in. Is it your understanding, how much of that is target costs? I guess target costs would be stuff that could escalate and could be responsibility of the purchaser, you? How much of it is fixed and would be considered the responsibility of the consortium? The reason I ask is only because I know that regulators are expecting that most of these costs would be fixed.","Stephen A. Byrne","Michael, I don't know that we have a breakdown of that. Again, until I see it I won't know what it is exactly, but certainly there will be some in each of those buckets. Also, I would anticipate that some of it would be in escalation costs. The escalation could be spread over all of the buckets. Then obviously, we may dispute some of those as we indicated with the $200 million when we talked about that over a year ago.","Some of it will be in just increased onus costs, so if I have people there for extra periods of time, I'm not going to back off on the hiring because I really need to staff. Hiring is going pretty well, and we're able to get good quality people. I don't want turn to turn that -- off, so if those folks are there for a longer period of time that would be higher onus costs. If the consortium has folks there for longer, that would be in the target bucket. Otherwise, it's really looking like escalation. It's not per se the fixed pieces but it would only be that small amount of escalation on the fixed pieces that might change.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.

The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. ","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information can be found in the investors section of our website under webcasts and presentations. ","I will now turn the call over to Jimmy. ","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on slide 3. Earnings in the third quarter of 2016 were $1.32 per share compared to $1.04 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a baseload review act rate increase, customer growth and extremely hot weather in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter last year. As an example Charleston, South Carolina, one of our largest metropolitan areas, registered their hottest month on record in July. ","Results also improved due to increased gas margins. As a reminder, during the third quarter of 2015, SCE&G adopted new depreciation rates for an electric plant as a result of a study. These new rates which produced an annual decrease in depreciation expense of approximately $29 million, were effective as of January 1, 2015, resulting in the application of three quarters' worth of depreciation savings being applied during the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, increases in O&M, interest and property taxes had a net negative impact on earnings. ","At the bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share during the third quarter 2016 and $0.11 per share in the third quarter of 2015, resulting in a positive $0.16 per share impact to earnings quarter over quarter. ","Slide 4 shows earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.29 per share versus $4.53 per share in 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI. Otherwise, power electric margins, due primarily to a baseload review act rate increase, customer growth and the positive impact of abnormal weather year to date would have resulted in improved comparative results. ","These increases were partially offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O7M and CapEx related items, including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.27 per share for the three quarters ended September 30, 2016 and $0.22 per share for the same period of 2015, resulting in a favorable $0.05 per share impact to earnings. ","Now on slide 5, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric and Gas Company's third quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.26 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to a higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, in addition to abnormally hot weather. ","These items were partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expenses, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest depreciation and property taxes. Year to date SCE&G's earnings were up by $0.20 per share in 2016 over the same period of 2015. ","PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.04 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher interest expense and depreciation related to the expansion of PSNC Energy's system. For the nine months ended September 30, earnings were down $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period in 2016. ","SCANA Energy provided a $0.02 per share increase in third quarter earnings over the previous year, primarily due to higher margins during third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings were $0.16 per share compared to $0.17 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter. ","SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the third quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the nine-month period, these businesses reported a loss of $0.10 per share in 2016, compared to earnings of $1.32 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015. ","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory, on slide 6. We're pleased by the continued economic growth in our service territories, as evidenced by announcements to invest approximately $1.2 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 4,600 jobs. ","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and SCE&G's electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 4.9%, as is the estimated rate in SCE&G's electric territory. Attesting to our state's strong economic growth, almost 56,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. ","Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.8% and 2.9%, respectively. As you can see, the rates are trending fairly consistent over the year. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were basically flat on a 12 months ended basis. ","Now please look at slide 8 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $10.6 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. ","In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-DORA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. ","Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the baseload review act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition revised this allowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective requests for revised rates which applied to the request that was approved last week and will become effective in November. ","Under the terms of our recently announced settlement agreement with the ORS and four other interveners and which Steve will discuss in more depth shortly, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective requests for revised rates beginning in 2017, if approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. ","As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below that allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the rate stabilization act. ","As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band and we filed for an annual increase in mid June. The Public Service Commission approved an annual increase of $4.1 million in September, with rates going into effect with the first billing cycle of November. As you are also aware, during the first quarter 2016 we filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition and the earned returns in that business. In late August PSNC Energy entered into a settlement agreement with the Public's staff and we expect a decision from the NCUC to be made some time shortly. ","As part of the settlement agreement, PSNC Energy agreed to a $19 million revenue increase and an authorized ROE of 9.7%. In addition, the settlement agreement allows PSNC Energy to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. We estimate that slightly more than 20% of our CapEx over the next three years will be subject to this integrity management rider. The new rates associated would be effective beginning November 1, 2016. ","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed-price option spending, as represented in the ORS settlement agreement as filed September 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect the existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction milestone payment schedule, as it is still being addressed through the dispute resolution board process. Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented. At the bottom of the slide we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods in which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated. ","Next, on slide 10, I would like to mention a recent tax election we made to claim Section 174 research and experimentation deductions for some of our new nuclear costs. After evaluating this section of the tax code, including recent court decisions and recently issued final regulations and after obtaining extensive external advice, we concluded that the regulations allow application of Section 174 research and experimentation deductions to our AP1000 units as a pilot model. We first claimed these deductions on our 2015 return which was filed last month and plan to make similar claims on our prospective returns. ","Essentially, this code section allows a current tax deduction for certain costs incurred in the year they are incurred rather than waiting to receive the deduction through accelerated or bonus tax depreciation once the units are placed in service. By claiming these deductions as costs are incurred we will forgo the depreciation deduction later. ","In short, it functions much like bonus depreciation in that the deduction is simply accelerated, although in this case it is accelerated and is realized as the money is spent rather than at the time the units are placed into service. This election will result in an increase in available cash in the near term and will therefore lessen the need for debt and equity issuances. This should benefit customers in several ways and also benefit existing shareholders through lower dilution. While the exact amounts are not completely known we have estimated the impact by year through 2018. ","While at a minimum customers will benefit from the impact of this cash source in the form of enhanced credit metrics supporting credit ratings, these deductions will also result in accumulation of a deferred tax credit. Deferred taxes are not contemplated by the BLRA law and will therefore be associated with our base electric business as a reduction to rate base. As such, we have proposed to the ORS that, as this credit to retail electric rate base bills and our resulting retail earned returns increase, we will also flow back benefits directly to customers through a credit or decrement rider to base electric rates. ","We also plan to propose this to the PSC in an accounting petition for their approval. This strategy does not change the timing or amounts of the BLRA revised rate increases for the remainder of the new nuclear construction. ","We believe this decrement rider treatment will allow us to offset some of the BLRA rate increases our customers will see during the peak construction years. Additionally, it allows for market ROEs [ph] for our shareholders consistent with our stated strategy of earning a reasonable return on the base business, while avoiding rate increases other than those associated with the BLRA. We do not project this election and proposed treatment will change our earnings guidance, as lower dilution and the rate decrements essentially offset one another from an EPS perspective. ","Now please look at slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This plan has been updated to reflect our results year to date, with the election of the fixed-price option as well as the expected impact of the section 174 deductions. Note that we have completed all of our planned financings for 2016. ","As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans until we have incremental equity needs which we currently estimate to be in 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts when the timing is presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and may change based upon the outcome of the petition filing, the dispute resolution board and the actual achievement of milestones. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50\/50 debt and equity basis. ","On slide 12 we're reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized earnings guidance as $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long term GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years, using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted, weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. ","We plan to address 2017 earnings guidance on the fourth quarter call after the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule and the conclusion of the petition process. ","I will now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project. ","Steve Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. On slide 13 you can see a photo of Hurricane Matthew making landfall on the South Carolina coast almost a year to the date of the historical flooding that happened in South Carolina in 2015. I would like to thank those of you who reached out and appreciate your thoughts and prayers for those were affected by this storm and in some cases are still trying to recover from last year's flood. I would also like to thank our linemen, tree crews and support staff, as well as those were dispatched from other areas as far away as Oklahoma, Texas and Mississippi. Immediately following the impact of the storm we had approximately 290,000 customers who reported outages. Within 48 hours, we had restored power to 190,000 and in 72 hours had restored power to 250,000 customers. Restoration was complete within eight days. ","Over the next few months, we will try to measure the Company's impact from the storm but it will not compare to the significant upheaval in the lives of those who were ultimately affected. ","Please now turn to slide 14. I would like to discuss the petition that SCE&G has filed with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina on May 26 of this year, seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule, as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. We're hopeful that the PSC will approve the settlement agreement we entered into with the ORS and four other interveners related to the aforementioned petition. ","This settlement agreement signifies that long-contested issues exist among the settling parties and supports the approval of the revised construction and capital cost schedules. As Jimmy already mentioned, the settling the parties also agreed to revise the allowed return on equity to 10.25% from 10.5%, calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2017. In addition, SCE&G will not file for future requests to amend capital cost schedules until after January 28, 2019. ","Slide 15 presents the relative schedule for the petition filing. We filed our direct testimony at the beginning of July and the ORS followed suit with their testimony and settlement agreement at the beginning of September. Our hearing with the PSC took place at the beginning of this month including after a minor delay due to Hurricane Matthew. The ORS presented the terms of the settlement agreement at the hearing. A decision by the PSC will come no later than November 28. ","Moving to some activities at the new nuclear construction site, slide 16 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from June of this year. Here you can see the significant progress that has been made so far on the project. I have labeled both units two and three as well as many other areas of the construction site. ","Slide 17 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that were located inside the containment vessel. We've now placed all of the major CA modules for unit two, as we had previously placed CA 01, 03, 04 and 05 and have more recently placed CAO2. We have also placed CA 04 and 05 for unit three. ","Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the unit two nuclear island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and the aforementioned structural modules, as well as the reactor vessel which was recently placed and which I will discuss more shortly. Outside of the containment vessel you can see the auxiliary building module, CA20 and the shield building which surrounds the containment vessel pillar. ","Slide 19 shows a picture of unit two CAO2 module being placed back in early August. CAO2 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. ","On slide 20 you see a picture of the unit two reactor vessel being placed. On August 30 this reactor vessel was placed on top of module CA04 inside the containment vessel. This is a significant milestone for our project as this is the first reactor vessel to be set in a new nuclear plant in the United States in more than 30 years. ","Slide 21 shows the placement of the second half of unit three's module CA20 which is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, the first half of this module was previously placed in order to move forward with shield building erection. ","Slide 22 shows a picture of the fabrication of the unit three module CAO1. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently all 47 submodules are on site and 44 of those submodules are upright and being welded together in the module assembling building or MAB. ","Slide 23 shows a picture of unit three module CA02 being fabricated in the MAB. Currently two of the five submodules have been upended and all five submodules are on site. ","On Slide 24 you can see a photo of the unit two de-aerator being placed on the unit two turbine building in late August. We have previously shown pictures of this massive 140-foot long, 18-foot diameter component, as it was transported to the site by truck. This component purifies feedwater by removing developed gases. ","Slide 25 shows the generator stator being lifted up to the unit two turbine deck. This is the stationary portion of the main generator and was set on Tuesday of this week. ","Lastly, on slide 26, you can see the unit three turbine building where we placed the upper and lower sections of all three low-pressure turbine condensers in September. ","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Glad to hear that the storm recovery efforts are going well and my best wishes to everybody. The cash benefit from the R&D tax credit, the total you show there is $1.1 billion. Is that the total that you anticipate or were there further benefits in 2019 and 2020 through the construction period? ","Jimmy Addison","Yes, these are the substantial benefits that are applicable to 2015 and forward that we would realize in cash. There are some substantial benefits in 2014 and earlier that would require amended returns and, frankly, we would not get the benefit of any cash from until the issue will resolve, so we have not delineated those here on this chart. But these are the substantial benefits that we expect to see a cash benefit from until the issue is resolved which we expect to take likely several years. ","Michael Weinstein","Do have an estimate for what the total benefit could be upon resolution? ","Jimmy Addison","The periods from the time we began the project up through 2014 -- and, let me clarify, 2015's return, as I said in the prepared remarks, was filed September 15, so that number is in the 2016 benefit. We're showing the year that the cash benefit would show up. So, 2014 and earlier could amount to an excess of $500 million on a comparable basis. ","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And how much nuclear rate base do you anticipate will be assigned to 10.5% ROE in 2015? And how much has already been assigned 11%? ","Jimmy Addison","The chart on page 8 shows our nuclear CapEx of about $4.2 billion and that includes some of all three. I don't know that I have it at my fingertips but we can break that down for you and the IR staff can provide that afterwards. So this includes some -- the majority is at the 11% and then would include some at the 10.5%, as well, that the new rates will be effective in December. ","Operator","The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just to go back to this issue really quickly on taxes, just to clarify twofold. One, in terms of the impact, basically if you think about it in a bonus depreciation comparable way, this is effectively equal to the $125 million you previously forecast for 2017 equity issuance, give or take $0.04, cumulative through the forecast period here? ","Jimmy Addison","You're going to have to run that one by me again, Julien. I'm not following you. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I just wanted to make sure I heard you guys right. When you discussed the negative earnings impact of recognizing the taxes, as you've just filed on a prospective basis, that is equal through the 2018 period to the reduction in equity issuance -- I.e., the less dilution that you would suffer, so the $125 million of equity. ","Jimmy Addison","Let me recap it. The positive benefit is obviously from less dilution and less interest related to debt that will not be issued, as well. Offsetting that would be when our returns increase on the base electric business because of the accumulation of this deferred tax credit reducing rate base. We're proposing to offset electric rates in the future, lower base electric rates to mitigate that. So, that would be the offset. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right. And perhaps could you quantify, what's the reduction in rate base cumulatively through the 2018 period that you are showing? ","Jimmy Addison","It will be the amount of cash that's shown on here, so cash is what would be offset against rate base. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, one for one, right? ","Jimmy Addison","Right. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then just separately, what's the status on the dispute resolution board? I suppose they gave you an update or there was a production of press release that said negotiations should continue. What is the latest, perhaps or why the continuation as such? ","Steve Byrne","This is Steve. The continuation was because we were really not in disagreement over the total amount and we were in general agreement on the milestones. The only disagreement was on timing. So, the dispute resolution board, this is the first issue that's come before them so they were getting up to speed on the project, as well on the parties. ","They wanted to give us basically an extra month or so to see if we could reach agreement before they would hand one back to us. So, we're in discussions now with Westinghouse to see if we can come to an agreement and give that back to the dispute resolution board prior to them issuing a ruling to us. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And then a last quick clarification here in terms of any risk of delay of the project, what's the status of the efforts to extend the PTC? And then, also, I suppose before, at least in the case of your peer who is pursuing this, I suppose if the project wasn't completed by 2020 there would also be a potential less qualification of bonus depreciation for the asset. But given the shift in tax recognition, is that also another implicit benefit or offset should there be a further delay? ","Jimmy Addison","That is an implicit benefit. We're essentially taking some of that, economically at least, earlier. The other implicit benefit we haven't really talked about or focused on to this point is that by moving this what would have been bonus depreciation or makers depreciation earlier, gives us more headroom to deal with PTCs down the road, in general. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Right, absolutely. And then where does that effort from a legislative process stand? ","Steve Byrne","We're not directly plugged into the effort. Our understanding is that it came out of committee favorably, that it may be taken up by the Congress shortly. That date is in the law so it would require a change in law to change the in-service date. ","Operator","The next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","I was wondering on the petitions, the settlements and as it relates to both the capital cost and milestone revisions in the fixed-price option, what are the tracks there for those? You laid out pretty clearly that the petition was a capital cost adjustment and the milestones. What's the track look like for the fixed-price option and how closely related are those two? ","Jimmy Addison","Travis, do you mean timing wise? They were all part of the same settlement heard by the Commission and the same docket. So, we would expect all to be ruled on likely in the next 30 days. ","Travis Miller","Okay, so just one ruling on the whole thing. ","Jimmy Addison","Yes. ","Travis Miller","Okay. And then the petition numbers would also include those updated numbers for the fixed costs. ","Jimmy Addison","That's right. ","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Ellinghaus with Williams Capital. Please go ahead.","Chris Ellinghaus","Is the goal with the conversation with Westinghouse to meet the deadline for the resolution board? Are you optimistic you can meet that deadline? ","Steve Byrne","The resolution board has given us a deadline that is in about 10 days, I think it is, maybe a little less than that. Do I think we could? It really depends on how much both parties want to meet the deadline to avoid going back before that resolution board. I don't know that I would handicap what the odds are, but the goal for both sides is that we reach resolution and go back to the dispute resolution board with a resolution such that they don't have to issue us a ruling. Both sides are clear on that one. ","Chris Ellinghaus","Okay. Jimmy, it's not entirely clear on a couple of issues relative to the Section 174 discussion. I appreciate that you removed the 2017 dilution. One, this wasn't originally in your growth expectations, the selection of using the credit? ","Jimmy Addison","You are speaking of earnings growth? ","Chris Ellinghaus","Yes. ","Jimmy Addison","No, it was not and nor was the rate decrement rider which I referred to. And, as I said in the prepared remarks, they essentially offset each other from an earnings perspective. So, it really doesn't alter the earnings growth, our forecast. ","Chris Ellinghaus","Right. And particularly since you had a bit of a windfall in the third quarter, it's almost $40 million from weather, is there a chance that the 2018, after you've gone through the process with the Commission in terms of the decrement rider and having a really good third quarter, that there could be additional changes to the 2018 equity expectations? ","Jimmy Addison","As I also said, there's always a chance that those equity expectations could change. But I would say much more significant than that are likely due to the timing of the payment milestone schedule that we've been talking about with several questioners early. That's going to cause us to readjust our nuclear CapEx once that comes out and that's more likely to be a significant driver than anything else. Of course, that will be timing. ","Chris Ellinghaus","Okay. And one last thing -- as far as the PNC order goes, is there anything that's leading them to take the maximum time or is that just traditional regulator scheduling? ","Jimmy Addison","We haven't been in front of them in eight years, so we don't have a lot of experience there. But I would say that, from what I know, it more has to do with one intervener who did not settle, the North Carolina Attorney General and some back-and-forth between her and our attorneys with the Commission just clarifying some positions. ","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Most of my questions have been answered. Just on sales growth, it seems that residential made a big change, the trailing 12 months versus last quarter. It's was up plus 2% and now it's only 0.3% or something. I've got to look at the numbers again. But it seemed like quite a big change. I was wondering -- this is the weather normalized, is what I'm talking about -- what happened? ","Jimmy Addison","Yes, you have the numbers correct. I can't answer your question specifically. That's why we try to really look at these things over time to come up with any trend. One thing I will tell you is it's the hottest quarter that I remember in my career, my 25 years here at SCANA. As I have said to you before, there's not an exact science in separating the weather and the average usage. I wouldn't get too hung up on something to the 10th of a percentage in one quarter, with a quarter with this extreme weather. ","Paul Patterson","Right, but this is for the last 12 months, though. That's the reason why. I can understand, in the quarter things are a little bit wacky. it just seems like, if I might, this is a trailing 12 months and it seemed like it was a big delta. Let me ask you this -- is leap year in this number? ","Jimmy Addison","Yes, it is. ","Paul Patterson","So, in other words it includes an extra day for that. ","Jimmy Addison","It does. ","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then, just in general, going forward, could you just refresh my memory as to what your retail sales growth is embedded in your numbers, your outlook? ","Jimmy Addison","For 2016? For longer term? ","Paul Patterson","Yes, longer term but 2016, whatever you have. ","Jimmy Addison","Sure, I will give you both. For 2016 it was virtually flat to just a slight negative that we'd expected overall for the year for 2016 in our plans that the $4, the $3.92 to $4.10 are based off of. Long term, in our IRP, we expect about 1.3% net and that's 1.6% gross, net of about 30 basis points of energy efficiency demand-side management. ","Paul Patterson","Okay. And that's over a ten-year period? ","Jimmy Addison","15, and a lot of that is being driven off of industrials, especially in the nearer term where we continue to have incredible economic growth here in South Carolina. So, that's driving it, as well. ","Paul Patterson","If we were to take that out, what would residential and commercial -- what are you guys just generally thinking about that? ","Jimmy Addison","We don't break the IRP down into those categories. It's really, therefore, planning for generation expansion. So, whether it's industrial or residential we've got to have the capacity there, so we really don't break it down over the long term by classes. ","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","First, your changes to the financing plan, you eliminated the issuance for this year and then increased the debt issuance for 2017 and 2018. Is that being driven more by just the construction payments requirements or is that the tax benefit or is it both? ","Jimmy Addison","It's both, but I would say more significantly the tax cash. ","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then I think you mentioned that unit three, you placed CA20 and did you say CA core? Is that correct? ","Steve Byrne","Yes, Dan, we placed the first half of CA20. We placed earlier in the year. The second half of CA20 we placed recently. The first half was in order so we could use it as framework to do other concrete pours to get moving with the shield building. But, yes, all sections of CA20 are now in place. ","Dan Jenkins","Okay. So, what's the next critical path on that? Is it CA01 or is it the shield building? ","Steve Byrne","The critical path for both units now, after CA20 was set on unit three, the critical path for both units now runs through the shield building. The CA01 for unit three is not far off. But right now everything runs through the shield building from both units. ","Dan Jenkins","So, related to that, are you still waiting on some of the panels to get on-site for both units? ","Steve Byrne","Yes, Dan, still waiting for some panels. Nothing that's holding me up right now. We're through five courses of the shield building on unit two. I've got all the core sixes. We weld the panels that come in together and lift them in twos and place them. So I've got them all welded together and twos already, so those are all ready to go. And I've got the first couple of courses for -- in fact, I think I've got the first five or six courses -- the trailing unit, unit three. So, I am not waiting on construction for any of the panels. I still don't have all of them in, so some of the higher elevation panels are not in. But I'm not waiting on the panels or anything. ","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then I think in your last update report, there was also some discussion about Fluor maybe having some troubles in terms of staffing up for the evening shift or whatever. I wondered if you could update us on that. ","Steve Byrne","Yes, Fluor, when they first came in, identified the need to increase staffing and wanted to staff a full back shift or night shift because we'd been operating with a skeleton crew night shift or back shift up to that point. Initially they had some difficulty in hiring but I would say that they recently have rectified that. They are now adding net about 150 people a month. ","They laid out a target when they got here to hire 1,200 people this year. They will probably exceed that total. So, now what they are doing is focusing on the specific craft discipline needs. So, if I hire 100 people that are all carpenters and I need welders, that doesn't do me any good. So, right now they are focusing on those craft that we need. The craft that we need are welders and fitters or rod busters for conduit. ","So, they are doing a good job, they're trying some innovative things, implementing multilingual workforces, those kinds of things. So, we're very happy with what Fluor is doing for us. They've been very successful recently. ","Dan Jenkins","Okay. So, that second shift then is pretty operational now? ","Steve Byrne","Second shift is up and running. It's not fully staffed. They would like to have probably 1,000 people on that second shift which would include the craft plus manual and supervision. They are probably somewhere along the lines of 60% to 70% of the way there. ","Operator","The next question comes from Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Three housekeeping items and then we're going to go back to this infamous slide number 10. Can you just remind us, on your targeted capital structure, the targeted FFO metrics and what your dividend policy is again? ","Jimmy Addison","FFO, we want to obviously be above 13 to be able to maintain credit ratings. And I would say that obviously this cash benefit of the taxes you referred to has a substantial benefit there. So, we feel much better about that. The second part of your question? ","Jim von Riesemann","Maybe the targeted capital structure and then the dividend policy. ","Jimmy Addison","Dividend policy is 55% to 60% payout and we're about the middle of that now. So, we're in good shape there. ","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And let's just go back to this slide 10 question. I'm trying to simplify everything you said. So, you get the cash benefit today, you get no rate base hit until the units are placed into service and the true up happens. Is that correct? Because you guys are basically, your BLRA is set up using quip? Is that right? ","Jimmy Addison","No, I don't think I've got that clear for you here. Let me start over there. You get the cash benefit today. Deferred taxes are not contemplated in the BLRA law. Therefore, it defaults over to the base electric business. ","Even though it originates from the new nuclear spending, the deferred tax credit and the credit to rate base will apply to the rest of the electric business, if you will. So, if we did nothing on the rate decrement, our strategy to keep returns from 9% to 10.25% would grow over the 10.25%. ","So, our proposal to the Office of regulatory Staff is to take those earnings that are above that band or beyond that band and pass those back to the customers through a base electric decrement that would coincide with the same timing that the BLRA increases occur through revised rates each year, basically at the end. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Greg Rice with Millennium. Please go ahead.","Greg Rice","I just wanted to follow-up on what Jim was talking about right there and the way this decrement rider is going to work. So, basically, as your earnings on the base business increase, because the rate base is decreasing, does this essentially mean that you will be earning that 10.25% because you will be refunding everything above the 10.25% to ratepayer through the rider? ","Jimmy Addison","We haven't been that precise yet with our discussions with the regulators, with the ORS. What we're proposing, what we've said all along is, if we're in that 9% to 10.25% range, we feel good about that, about what we're doing in the base business. ","So, we're not paying it at 10.25% necessarily. But we're in discussions with them as long as we can stay in that range of 9% to 10.5%. And necessarily there's going to be a little bit of a timing issue here because we're going to need to see what did we earn and then pass it back on a prospective basis. I suspect we will be more down in that range, not at 10.25%. ","You look at our track record and we've been earning right about 9.75%, 9.5%, this quarter 10.1% but was driven, about 50 bps, off of weather there. So, we've been in the 9.5%, 9.75% range and hopefully as we implement this we could be in that range prospectively. ","Greg Rice","Maybe you set a cap saying if you ever go above the 10.25% you'll end up refunding. Is that the way to think about it? It seems like you shouldn't be refunding anything if you are in a 9.5% band. ","Jimmy Addison","What we're doing here is trying to work which we always do, with our regulatory staff to do something reasonable with the customers. We're not trying to set up a mechanism that's completely mechanical, driven off the top of the 10.5%. We're trying to also mitigate the rate increases on the customer. The Blabs work real well. We recognize that and we want to share these cash benefits back. And, as I said, we don't really see it impacting our earnings guidance. So, that's why we propose what we have. ","Greg Rice","And then just on the nuclear spend, how much have you spent year to date on the project? ","Jimmy Addison","Year to date -- let's see if I have that nearby. I don't even know that I have that at my fingertips. I really don't have year to date spend here at my fingertips. ","Greg Rice","Not a problem. I can follow up afterwards. ","Jimmy Addison","I know we're estimating for the entire year to be around $950 million or so and I don't think we will be off that substantially. But I don't have the through September 30 number. ","Greg Rice","And I just wanted to confirm, for spend that's happening on a nuclear project after June 30, 2016 which everything before that would have gone in this last BLRA, would you be earning AFUDC earnings basically all the way through December of 2017 on that spend when you get the next BLRA increase? ","Jimmy Addison","Yes. ","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks. ","Jimmy Addison","Thank you. We look forward to concluding the regulatory proceedings before the South Carolina and North Carolina Public Service Commissions and the receipt of the construction milestone payment schedule. And, as a side note, we will be attending the LEI conference in a couple of weeks and hope to see many of you there. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA. ","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for to attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"19255":["SCANA (NYSE:SCG) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 31, 2013  3:00 PM ET","Executives","Byron W. Hinson - Director of Investor Relations","Jimmy E.

Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Andrew Levi","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 31, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are: Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we'll respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","I would also like to mention that we recently began a new process of posting new nuclear project-related information directly to our website at scana.com. On the SCANA homepage, there's a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website. That section contains a yellow box with a link to project-related news and updates. It is possible that some of the information that we've posted from time to time may be deemed material information that does not otherwise become public. This new process replaces our prior practice of furnishing a Form 8-K, the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff in connection with SCE&G's new nuclear project. Instead, the company now posts copies of those reports in the new nuclear section on the SCANA website.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. And the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Byron, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the third quarter of 2013 were $0.94 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were principally offset by increases in CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution and a minor increase in O&M.","Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013, were $2.67 versus $2.41 in 2012. Similar to the quarter, increases in electric and gas margins were partially offset by higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program and minor increases in O&M.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's third quarter basic earnings, denoted in blue, were down $0.01 compared to 2012. Earnings were $139 million for the third quarter of 2013 compared to $132 million for the third quarter of 2012. Higher margins from base rate increases, along with customer growth, were offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses as well as CapEx-related costs, including property taxes, depreciation and share dilution. Year-to-date, basic earnings were higher by $0.16, due primarily to higher electric and gas margins. PSNC Energy reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 for the third quarter of 2013, in line with the same period of last year. For the 9-month period ended September 30, shown in red, basic earnings were $0.21 per share, also in line with the prior year.","SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, shown in green, reported a seasonal loss of $0.03 per share for the third quarter, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are up $0.09, primarily due to a return to normal weather during first quarter of 2013. Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a 1-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current 2-year term and will end in August 2015. SCANA Energy has served as the regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002. SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported flat earnings in the third quarter compared to a loss of $0.02 in 2012. For the 9-month period, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013 compared to $0.03 in 2012.","Now I would like to speak about our operation and maintenance expenses for the year. As we've previously mentioned, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. One of the instruments in achieving this goal is O&M cost control. We estimated during the Q2 call that O&M expenses would be approximately 3.5% higher in 2013 with 2.5% driven by specific rate case-related expense and amortizations of previously deferred items. While these amortizations are occurring as projected, the other projected expense growth has been mitigated by cost control efforts, such as lower labor cost. Currently, we have approximately 100 fewer employees, excluding our nuclear construction activity, than we had at the end of September 2012. The reduced headcount, along with lower incentive compensation accruals, have resulted in lower O&M labor cost of approximately $10 million compared to last year. These savings have offset increases in pension cost, which were anticipated in our electric rate order, and higher health care costs. Considering the cost control efforts, we now project full year O&M expenses to grow at approximately 2.5% over 2012 levels or basically flat, excluding the rate case-related items.","I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service territory as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. Through the third quarter of this year, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $1.75 billion with expectations of creating approximately 7,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We are pleased that this year is shaping up to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our region. You can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the 3 states where SCANA has a presence. The unemployment rate in SCE&G's electric territory, denoted in blue, of 7%, is 200 basis points better than during the peak of the recession. And both continues to be favorable compared to the national rate and continues to decline due to the industrial expansion. The Port of Charleston continues to see increased traffic and finished this June 2013 fiscal year with container volume up 9%. Also going into fiscal year 2014, the port handled approximately 145,000 units in August, which is the highest recorded monthly volume since October of 2008. Year-to-date, fiscal year 2014 container volumes are up 4.5% over the prior year and 1.8% ahead of their plan. As I mentioned before, it's estimated that 1 of every 5 jobs in South Carolina is related to port volume. This increased traffic is a very good sign for the local economy.","Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see accelerating customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric growth is 1.3%, the highest it's been since the first quarter of 2009. And SCE&G's gas growth is at 2.2%, its highest level since the third quarter of 2007. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina grew at 2%. The bottom table outlines our weather normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter in the 12 months ended September 30. Overall, weather normalized sales were down 0.9% for the quarter and 0.6% on a 12-month ended basis. Industrial sales are showing the most improvement, driven by the expansion discussed earlier but are more than offset by the residential and commercial decline. As I've mentioned previously, there continues to be uncertainty around residential average use, driven by conservation, CFL lightbulb adoption rates and more energy-efficient appliances. As our customers change their spending habits, we tightened our O&M cost control. I also believe the uncertainty in Washington has been a serious concern to all and has likely impacted spending habits.","Please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.2 billion. You can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The third quarter earned return in electric business is approximately 9.7%. Again, our strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations is essential to achieving this goal.","Continuing down the page. On our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. The South Carolina PSC recently approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base. And we will implement a rate increase in November of just under 2.9%. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina respectively, and we continue to run those businesses close to those returns. Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule outside of any Base Load Review Act or BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast was updated using the preliminary estimated BLRA third quarter quarterly report cash flows and reflects lower escalation and a shift in the in-service dates by up to 12 months for Unit 2 and a similar delay for Unit 3 as we've previously presented. Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Please turn now to Slide 10 to review the net change. This reflects the shift in construction cash flows due to the change in, in-service dates and the lower escalation. You will note that incremental CWIP from 2014 to 2016 is lower than filed in the last quarterly BLRA report driven by the lower escalation. Steve will provide an update on nuclear construction in a few moments.","Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2017. Earlier this year, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. And we do not anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013 other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. In June, SCE&G issued $400 million in first mortgage bonds. $150 million of this issuance was used to refinance maturing first mortgage bonds with the remainder used to repay short-term debt primarily incurred for construction of the new nuclear units. As a result of the shift in our nuclear spending and lower escalation, SCE&G will not need to issue any additional debt in 2013, eliminating the previously planned $200 million Q4 issuance. We do project that we will need an additional $50 million in the 2016, 2017 timeframe, but the overall debt plan has been reduced by $150 million over the remaining construction cycle.","As it relates to our equity issuances, our additional equity needs, denoted in the blue box, are projected to be lower over the 4-year period by $75 million. The new projected additional equity is approximately $425 million rather than the previous estimate of $500 million. We now estimate that we will issue approximately $100 million in late 2014, $125 million in 2015 and $200 million in the 2016, '17 timeframe, reducing the overall equity plan by $75 million over the remaining construction period. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to a change in inflation, bonus depreciation, the construction schedule or other factors. The financing plan, CapEx plan and in-service dates for Units 2 and 3 now reflect the current assessment of our new nuclear construction project.","We're very pleased to report that earlier this month, we successfully extended our credit facility by 1 year. As you may recall, the committed lines of credit total $1.8 billion. $1.6 billion covers the entire 5 years and will expire in October 2018. And an additional $200 million, which was added for peak construction liquidity, covers 3 years and will expire in October 2016. The additional liquidity is important to our nuclear construction and the tenors spans substantially all of the planned peak construction period of the new units. I would again like to thank our banks for their enthusiastic support of our liquidity needs and support of our nuclear expansion plans. We're also pleased that we received an excellent response for our liquidity needs during nuclear construction from our equity and debt investors.","Now please turn to Slide 12. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 per basic earnings per share along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20. We plan to provide 2014 annual guidance in our year-end call in February.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. I will begin by providing an update on the schedule, a few details on the related costs, progress at CB&I and on-hook dates for our critical path components.","Please turn to Slide 13. The company is affirming that we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This range is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. The in-service date for Unit 3 will be similarly delayed or roughly 12 months after Unit 2. The company is also affirming the previously reported upper-bound estimate of approximately $200 million of additional costs associated with this schedule change driven by 3 factors: owners cost, EPC cost and escalation. This $200 million represents SCE&G's 55% share of the project's cost including escalation.","It is important to note that SCE&G has not accepted responsibility for any of the delay costs and expect to continue discussions with the consortium regarding responsibility for any increase. Additionally, our EPC contract provides for liquidated damages in the event of a delay in the completion of the facility, which have not been factored into our estimate and would also be included in discussions with the consortium. In summary, we believe SCE&G's responsibility for any portion of the $200 million estimate should ultimately be limited to substantially less, once all the relevant factors are considered.","Now I'd like to turn your attention to Slide 14. CB&I Lake Charles has taken numerous steps in the last quarter to mitigate further delays to the project. Some of the changes include CB&I Lake Charles facility is now working 2 12-hour shifts 7 days a week. CB&I facility has also moved fabrication of several components to other vendors in an effort to relieve the burden on the facility. Fabrication of module CA-03 has been moved to Pegasus Steel's facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. Fabrication of shield building structural modules has been assigned to Newport News Industries or NNI. CB&I also moved fabrication of CA-04 to the V.C. Summer site for completion. As it relates to submodules, all of the submodules required to assemble CA-20 to be able to meet its on-hook date are now on-site at V.C. Summer. I'll address CA-20 and on-hook dates later in my comments. The descoping and shipment of submodules has opened up floor space, allowing fabrication of more submodules for the critical path component of CA-01. I'll discuss this a little more in detail later in my comments. The cost of moving fabrication activities to other vendors in an effort to relieve the burden on the facility are at the contractors' convenience, and as such, would be the responsibility of the consortium. Additionally, we have visited both Pegasus and NNI and feel confident in their nuclear safety culture of these facilities and that they meet industry expectations.","I also wanted to give you a brief update on the on-hook dates for some of the structural modules. The on-hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will be complete and it is ready to be placed on the hook of the heavy lift derrick. Module CA-20, seen on Slide 15, is an ancillary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. Here you can see a portion of this module on-site in the Module Assembly Building at the V.C. Summer facility. This module has on-hook date of Q1 of 2014. We recently agreed to receive certain CA-20 submodules from the Lake Charles facility that will allow minor rework and paperwork completion at the V.C. Summer site. This will free up additional space at the Lake Charles facility.","Module CA-01 on Slide 16 is a steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. On-site fabrication of this module for our project has not yet begun. But here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of the China sites. This module has an on-hook date of Q3 of 2014. Finally, module CA-03 on Slide 17. It's a Southwest wall module of the in-reactor water storage tank inside of the containment vessel. Fabrication of this module for our project has also not yet begun. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. This module has on-hook date of Q4 of 2014. On Slide 18, you can see a summary that outlines the on-hook dates for these 3 modules.","I would now like to direct your attention to the recent activities at the site on Slide 19. As I've mentioned previously, we completed an over-50-hour continuous pour of the nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, for our first new unit, which can be seen in the picture at the top of the slide. The basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat. You can see this module at the bottom left of the slide. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted in place using the heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. As you can see at the bottom right, the containment vessel bottom head, which was also assembled on-site, was lifted into place by the heavy lift derrick in May. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer.","On Slide 20, you can see pictures of the placement on the CA-04 reactor vessel cavity for Unit 2. This component was built on-site. In late September, this module was placed in the containment vessel bottom head. Its purpose is to house the reactor vessel, which we'll show you a picture of shortly.","On the top of Slide 21, you can see a picture of the first containment vessel ring for Unit 2, which will be placed on the containment vessel bottom head. As pointed out in the photo, this section of rings contains penetrations for equipment and personnel access. At the top right of the same slide, you'll see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. Cooling Tower 2 Alpha is structurally complete and is being fitted with electrical and mechanical components. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continued to progress as anticipated.","At the bottom left, you will see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. We have completed the placement of the dental concrete, the leveling concrete, the lower mudmat, the vapor barrier and the upper mudmat. The reinforcement barricades has been assembled and we plan to pour the first nuclear concrete for this unit this quarter. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island for Unit 3. On the bottom right, you will see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Placement of the Unit 2 Turbine Building basemat and associated walls has been completed.","On Slide 22, you can see where the first of 3 lower condenser sections was set in the Unit 2 Turbine Building in July. This was the Bravo condenser. The Charlie condenser has also been set and the Alpha is scheduled to be set sometime soon. On Slide 23, you can see a schematic of how the various turbine building models will look when complete. The 5 modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in the final locations. That's CH-80, CH-81 Alpha, CH-81 Bravo and the previously discussed 2 lower condensers. Slide 24 shows the turbine building with the aforementioned modules in place. The Alpha condenser will be set between CH-81 Alpha and CH-80.","On Slide 25, you'll see some components that have arrived on-site. On the top, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 Reactor Vessel. The reactor vessel will sit inside of module CA-04, which has been placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel bottom head and will house the fuel assemblies. On the bottom right, you see the low-pressure turbine rotors, 2 Alpha and 2 Bravo as they arrive via railcar. There are 3 low-pressure and 1 high-pressure driven rotor for each of the new units. On the bottom left, you see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the heavy lift derrick.","On Slide 26, you see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018. It has been updated to reflect our estimates that will be in our Q3 2013 BLRA quarterly report. That report will be filed around November 8 of this year. As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act.","Please now turn to Slide 27. As we mentioned in our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for revised rates under the Base Load Review Act in May. In response to that request, in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $67.2 million. The new rates were effective for builds rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2013 are shown at the bottom of the slide. And as you can see, in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the Office of Regulatory Staff for the second quarter of 2013. And as I mentioned, we intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter of 2013 in November.","On Slide 28, you will see a breakout of total nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our estimate for the November 2013 BLRA project cost, which is down approximately $150 million from our August 2013 BLRA report and approximately $663 million from the original approval received from the South Carolina Public Service Commission. As you can see and as Jimmy mentioned earlier, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to kind of talk to you about sort of the longer-term growth rates here. You heard your colleague to the South talk about it yesterday. As you see beyond the current construction program, how do you think about your EPS growth rate in the 3% to 6% you've discussed?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, our range for a 3- to 5-year period. And that really takes us through -- I mean, we still have construction going on through that entire period. So we really don't -- haven't provided any outlook beyond that period, not prepared to today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","So if I look at Slide 4, we are $2.67 basic EPS year-to-date. And if I'm right, last year, we earned around $0.78 in the fourth quarter in December. So if one assumes that we earn at a similar level, we come to like $3.45 for the whole year. So at the rate at the top of the guidance, is there something in the fourth quarter which is going to be abnormal or anything? I'm just trying to see why the guidance was -- why aren't you pointing towards the upper end of the guidance for the year? Or am I missing something which is there in the fourth quarter?","Jimmy E. Addison","I'd say, Ashar, 2 primary reasons. Number one, we continue to watch this consumption issue that was highlighted over on Page 7, I believe it is. So we've got a little bit of a hedge built in for what we've seen in the last couple of quarters there, with lower consumption particularly in the residential, small commercial side. And then the second is in my comments there earlier, so year-to-date, we're basically flat year-over-year O&M. But we really project our year-over-year as of 12\/31 to be more like 2% to 2.5% above last year. So we have some projects in the fossil hydro area that are going to occur in the fourth quarter that are O&M-related. We have health care cost trends that we know are going to impact us. We got in one of our property tax bills after we closed the books for September for one of our larger counties. So that's part of what we're contemplating in there as well. But I understand your comment. And if you ask me my bias today, it's on the upper end of the $3.35. I would have more of a bias towards being above that than below it. And frankly, most of the guys on the street are already there. I looked at it earlier today, and I think a half dozen or more are between $3.35 and $3.40 already.","Ashar Khan","And then to build upon that, Jimmy, 2014 as you show in your slides, the AFUDC is higher. The rate increase under the BLRA is higher. And now of course, the equity is going to come in at the end of the year, which was always forecast. But of course, now the amount is lower. And the debt requirements, you have also lowered. So does that not -- should one not assume that we should be again that the upper end of the growth rate has moved from '13 to '14?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, costs are changing, too. So we're in an economy now that has some inflation in it. So we are granting pay increases year-over-year now. We're hiring folks at the nuclear project, so we're bringing more folks online there. And I'd say the main thing, Ashar, though is continue just watching this consumption issue, what's going on in the base business. Even though our growth rates of number of customers is accelerating, folks are still concerned about the economy. And that's clear in our data as well as others. I saw just yesterday consumer confidence dropped over 15% from quarter-to-quarter. So I think until there's a clearer picture nationally that Washington has gotten their act together and that the economy is going to get on some solid footing, I think we're all wiser to be a little cautious.","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up a little bit on the demand stuff on Slide 7 that you're looking at. If I look at the top box and I see the customer growth and if I kind of look over the last couple of quarters, it may be averaging 1% or so. But then I look at the bottom box and we see, especially the residential, commercial down, I don't know, call it what, 1.5%. Does that mean that your actual per customer usage is going down, call it, 2% or something more than that, 1.5%? Wondering if I was reading that right and if you could clarify that.","Jimmy E. Addison","No, I think you're exactly right. I mean, that's what's going on the last couple of quarters. We have generally used 12-month numbers to present for this information. I got several requests last quarter from you guys to give separate quarterly data, so we've begun doing that. But there's a lot of volatility in quarterly data. I look back over the last 3 years and we've had 6 quarters where it's been up, 5 quarters where it's been down just over the last, I guess, 2 years and 3 quarters here. So there's a lot of volatility that happens in there. And some of those have been up as much as 10% and down as much as 5%. So it was just the economy, the volatility, the fits and starts of the economy. There's no clear direction at this point. The one thing I'd take away from this that is more consistent are the consistent 2-plus years of good, solid economic announcements we've had here with good solid jobs. And a lot of those announcements from 1 year or 18 months ago are turning into hard jobs now once the sites are built out, et cetera, from the tire industry, pharmaceuticals and others. And the industrial sales are moving in the right direction. And that ultimately translates into more confidence in the local economy and in the commercial area. I think the data I cited earlier around the Port of Charleston, their traffic is a good long-term indicator, too. But folks are still concerned. And I still think their biggest kind of reservation maybe the lack of coming to any conclusions in Washington.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then to follow up on that, kind of take the next step there, what's that long-term projection for demands that we should think about in that 3% to 6% earnings growth? And then tied to that, that 9.7% earned ROE, how much of that is demand? If we see, I presume if we were to see kind of continued 2% demand shrinking, that would have a big impact on the 3% to 6% earnings growth rate.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, it would affect if it continues for a long period of time. So here's what we see, and it's just our projection. But what we see is industrial demand continuing to grow. And in the short term, the next 18, 24 months, we continue to see pressure on particularly the residential segment as more of the efficiency standards move through the residential class, CFL lightbulbs, higher-efficiency HVAC systems, lower electric-consuming TVs, et cetera. That's already happened in the industrial sector and to a large sector in the commercial segment as well. But that is really what we see driving the short term in the residential segment. But in the long term, we really see kind of a net growth of slightly above 1% in the long-term demand. And that's what is really driving our generation expansion down the road.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I wanted to follow up on this a little bit because you're right, it is volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But it's so volatile it seems that the last 6 months, the 12-month number has gone from a positive 1.3% to now a negative number. And the components there above have also changed. And to sort of follow up on Travis' question here, you're -- it sounded to me like you're sort of projecting perhaps negative growth for the next 18 months. Is that right?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, we certainly see the residential segment having pressure on it just because of the efficiencies moving through. I mean, there aren't any more incandescent lightbulbs being manufactured. So they have to, as lightbulbs [indiscernible] drop off now, they've got to put CFL bulbs in. And they are more energy-efficient. So we see that in our projections over the next couple of years.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So when you mentioned the Washington impact or just the sort of economic uncertainty impact, would you say that's -- how would you compare that impact to this just sort of what we're seeing in terms of energy efficiency for appliances, lightbulbs, that kind of activity?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Well, in our footprint, let's take before any of the new lighting standards moved through. Roughly 12% of our sales, residential sales, were driven by lighting. Once all of the current technology efficiencies move through the entire run, we see lighting making up about 6%. So the question is how fast has it moved through? And then what else is going on as far as conservation and just general uncertainty in the economy as it affects the residential customer? The price of gasoline, fluctuations, et cetera, what else causes the fits and starts in between? But we know somewhere at the end of this, there's going to be about a 6% change in the overall footprint, if you will, of the residential consumption related to lighting.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So we're at 12% now, is that correct?","Jimmy E. Addison","Before the reduced consumption started.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And when did happen?","Jimmy E. Addison","18 months, 24 months ago. I don't know precisely, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I guess, I mean, I don't mean to put you on spot here. But I'm just wondering, do you know where we are right now, like in terms of where we are in the forecast on this? Because like you said, that's a huge decrease...","Jimmy E. Addison","I don't know on that specific item, no. And I don't know that it's -- that's a survey-type data. I don't know that -- it isn't like I don't have it at my fingertips. I don't know that we can get it. I don't know when every household has changed every bulb.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yes, that would be a little bit intrusive.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So okay, fair enough. I mean, very interesting. Now in terms of the -- do you guys have any update or any information from your partners, Santee Cooper, in terms of what might happen with the disposition of their ownership?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, Paul, this is Steve. They're still interested in dispositioning their ownership. I think they're still interested in somewhere around the 10% share. As we understand it, they're still in discussions with Duke. And beyond that, I don't know that I can comment. You'd probably have to ask Santee Cooper.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. Any timeframe or any concept as to when we might get a decision one way or the other?","Stephen A. Byrne","That's up to Santee and Duke. But we would welcome Duke as a partner.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jimmy, Steve, real quick, just when thinking about the revisions to the nuclear capital spending schedule, big picture, relative to the last formal filing, where you outlined -- it's kind of a headwind or a tailwind, when you think about the impact on near term, let's say, 2014 or 2015 earnings power?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, I think it's -- if you think about -- if you're saying headwind in terms of lower BLRA increases, I think it is a headwind because there's lower cash flows forecasted in the next 2 to 3 years. And also the lower escalation, I mean, inflation continues to come down compared to what we originally projected, another $140 million lower in this recent data we just received last week. So that certainly would lower the expected increases and revenue increases related to that. But we don't necessarily view that as a negative. I mean, that's -- it really helps kind of flatten the impact on the customer. So we think that's a good thing in the long run.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But should we be thinking of it is, it gives you lower CapEx partially offset by lower financing needs. So lower revenue increases partially offset by lower financing needs, but then also it implies lower AFUDC. Am I kind of thinking about the 3 buckets in the right way?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think so. But the lower revenue and the lower financing costs, I mean, that's not a wash. Obviously, there's return built into the BLRA revenue for the equity side.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. And talking about the demand, we've seen this with a couple of other Southeast utilities, where industrial demand is actually making a pretty positive uptick. Have you done any work around historically, near term and long, the lag between industrial recovery and trends in residential and small commercial, maybe separate trends, kind of how they correlate to industrial recovery and how maybe that trend has changed versus industrial? Meaning do you typically or historically see a real-time change in residential and small commercial when you're seeing a change in industrial? Or does resi and small commercial lag industrial recovery or precede it?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Michael, I don't have anything objective to give you a kind of a 6-, 9-, 12-month answer. But I'll tell you, I do know that the residential customer generally lags going into a recession and kind of lags coming out because those jobs have to come up. They have to become employed. They have to dig out of their own personal holes they might have been in. And then they feel freer to have some discretionary income to spend and they're less focused on conservation, that kind of thing. But certainly, the dynamic is as you described it, but I can't tell you exactly the timing around it.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Last item, can you talk a little bit -- you gave a lot of great economic detail in terms of what's happening in your service territory. Can you talk a little bit about housing starts, what you're seeing locally, meaning in your sort of gas and electric service territories in terms of housing starts, kind of growth rates and occupancy rates?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. I don't have any of that objective data at my fingerprints. I've seen some recently. I just don't have it with me here, Michael. But it's fairly consistent with last year. And on the occupancy rates, particularly I was looking in a couple of our metro areas that we serve and the electricity footprint and the -- for example, office occupancy is down to some of its lowest levels since before the recession in Columbia and Charleston. So both of those markets are getting fairly, fairly low levels of available office space, too. But I don't have any of the exact numbers with me. We think that's public information. We can get it, and Christina can follow up with you later with it.","Operator","The next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Hey, just a couple of questions. On O&M going forward, I know you haven't given a forecast for '14. But can just talk on a high level your ability to keep O&M growing slower or cut some costs relative to your lower residential sales expectations?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. I think there is still some more room there. I do think probably the pace that we've been on the last couple of years, particularly in retaining attrition, netting down lower headcount, I think the pace of that is going to have to slow. If you just look across the different regulated businesses we have, we probably got 10,000, 12,000 more customers than we had a year ago, and we're serving them with 100 fewer employees. You can't continue that long term and keep your focus on customer service, reliability and safety. But I think there's still some more opportunity there, particularly as technology and a variety of areas offers more efficiency. I'd say kind of getting at the heart of your question, I do see O&M for '14 likely higher. We'll be out with our official forecast in the year-end call. But I'd probably say it's going to be more like the year-end range we're expecting now of something around 2% or so.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And just on the equity. So equity end of '14, it's $100 million of DRIP and $100 million of new equities. Is the way I read it?","Jimmy E. Addison","Right. We originally had $275 million of additional equity in '14. And now with the shift in the project and the lower escalation, we see only needing about $100 million late in '14.","Andrew Levi","And then CWIP is, what, about $141 million lower. Is that correct?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, let's see here. CWIP is $141 million lower for the June 30, '14. For calendar '13 and '14 together, it's probably about the same number, ironically, for a different reason but about $140 million lower.","Andrew Levi","So I guess, if we kind of run through the numbers, the lower equity kind of almost offsets the CWIP over a 12-month period?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. And there's lots of other moving parts out, too, operating cash flows, et cetera. But yes, on a simplistic basis, that's true.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then last question I have, it just seems on the nuclear, just to make sure I understand kind of what Steve went through. So schedule-wise, you're still on, still very confident about your schedule that you've reset in June. CBI (sic) [CB&I] and situations at Lake Charles seems to be improving. And bottom line is you're actually spending less, not spending more than what you thought in June. Is that kind of a fair summary?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think you captured it pretty well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","You've covered most of what I was going to ask about. But just briefly, the new nuclear project cost coming down from the August BLRA to the November, did I hear you right that, that's almost entirely just lower escalation?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then lastly, the $200 million that's being negotiated. Just conceptually, I mean, the Office of Regulatory Staff made it pretty clear in their report that the modules were delivered with welding that didn't meet regulatory requirements. I'm just wondering why is this even a debate. It seems like it's pretty clear that from the outside that, that should be paid for by CBI, (sic) [CB&I] not you guys. But maybe you can explain some of the counterpoints to that. And then lastly, just touch on the timing. Do you still think that will be resolved by year end?","Stephen A. Byrne","The resolution, I'm not sure it would be resolved by year end. And it isn't as if I'm going to be given a change order to say, \"Here, you owe me $200 million more.\" This is an estimate that we put together, try to bound what the costs would be. And obviously, we believe that they will be less than that $200 million figure. That's all of our 55% piece representing SCE&G's ownership in the project. And while on the surface, I would agree with you that the issues coming out of the modules at Lake Charles should be the responsibility of the consortium, I've been at this long enough to know that the consortium may not see it that way. So we're just anticipating a fervent discussion with them. And we're hopeful of a positive outcome that will be fair to both sides.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2015 and earlier in the week we released an update on our settlement with the Consortium regarding disputes on our new nuclear project.","Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer; Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G; and Kevin Marsh, our CEO.

I\u2019ll begin our call by thanking those of you who reached out to us during the historic rainfall and flooding that hit South Carolina earlier this month. It was and continues to be a trying time for our state and we appreciate your thoughts and prayers as things continued to progress.","While our systems was restored very quickly, property damage of the citizens of South Carolina will take a long time to restore and tragically several lives were lost and families altered forever.","Now on slide three, we will begin our earnings discussion. GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were a $1.04 per share, compared to a $1.01 per share in the same quarter of 2014. The improved results in the third quarter are mainly attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense, as I will discuss shortly.","These were partially offset by lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.06 per share, resulting from the sale of CGT and increases in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx related items included -- including interest and share dilution. Note that abnormal weather contributed $0.11 per share and $0.07 per share of additional electric margin in the third quarters of 2015 and 2014, respectively.","SCE&G periodically conducts depreciation studies related to electric plant to better determine the proper annual depreciation accrual rates. A new depreciation study performed earlier this year resulted in the adoption of depreciation rates, which produced an annual decrease to depreciation expense of approximately $29 million.","The PSC authorized SCE&G to implement the new depreciation rates effective January 1, 2015, and at the company's request, the retroactive $14.5 credit from the application of the new rates from January through June of this year has been used to offset a portion of the deferred fuel balance related to its retail electric operations. For the third quarter of 2015 and all subsequent periods the incremental reduction to depreciation expense will flow through income.","Now please turn to slide four. Earnings per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $4.53 per share versus $3.06 in 2014. The improved results are mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI, higher electric margins due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as lower depreciation expense as described earlier.","These were partially offset by lower electric margins due to weather from the first quarter, lower gas margins, primarily due to lost gas margins of $0.15 per share resulting from the sale of CGT and increase in O&M expense and expected increases in CapEx related items, including interest, property taxes and share dilution.","Although, electric margins reflected a negative $0.01 per share due to weather year-over-year, abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.22 per share year-to-date 2015, compared to $0.23 per share in 2014.","Slide five shows earnings on a GAAP adjusted weather-normalized basis. Earnings in the third quarter of 2015 were $0.93 per share, compared to $0.94 per share in the same quarter of 2014. Year-to-date, September earnings were $2.90 per share in 2015, compared to $2.83 per share in the prior year.","As a reminder, GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI from the first quarter of 2015.","Based upon our results to-date and our expectations for the balance of the year, we are reaffirming our 2015 GAAP adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.80 per share.","Now on slide six, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings were up $0.06 compared to the same period of 2014.","Increases in earnings were due primarily weather, the continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA and customer growth. The application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates also positively contribute to earnings for the quarter.","These items were offset by increases in O&M expenses and expenses related to our capital program including interest expense and share dilution. Year-to-date earnings were higher by $0.13 due primarily to the same drivers as the quarter with the exception of weather.","PSNC Energy\u2019s reported a seasonal loss of $0.04 per share in the third quarter of 2015, compared to a loss of $0.02 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to increased O&M, depreciation and property taxes, partially offset by customer growth. Year-to-date, 2015 earnings are $0.21 per share, compared to $0.23 per share in the prior year.","SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, showed a decrease in third quarter earnings of $0.01 per share in 2015 over the same quarter of last year, primarily due to increased O&M.","For the nine-month period ended September 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share. On a GAAP basis, SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.06 per share in the third quarter of 2015 consistent with the prior year.","Lower interest expense at the holding company and increased margins in our marketing business were primarily offset by foregoing earnings contributions from subsidiaries that were sold during the first quarter of this year.","For the nine-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $1.37 in 2015, compared to $0.02 in 2014. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of a $1.41 per share, GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS was down $0.06 from the prior year, again due to foregoing earnings from the sale of the businesses earlier this year.","I would now to touch on economic trends in our service territory on slide seven. So far in 2015, companies have announced plans to invest over a $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 3,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We are excited by the continues growth in our service territories as Carolina continued to seen as a favorable business environment.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolinas unemployment rate is now at 5.7% and the rate in SCE&G\u2019s electric territory is estimated at 5.3%. Of particular interest and attesting to our states strong economic growth approximately 80,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago.","Slide eight presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G\u2019s electric business added customers at a year-over-rate of 1.6%.","Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at an accelerated rate of 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended September 30, 2015. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.7% on a 12-month ended basis.","We continue to be encouraged by the strong industrial expansion that has in turn led to strong sales growth not only in the industrial sector, but also in the residential and commercial markets.","Now please turn to slide nine which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G\u2019s base electric business in which we allotted 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for 12 months ended September 30 in the base electric business is approximately 9.7%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years.","We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. We are allowed to return on equity at 10.25% and 10.6% in South and North Carolina respectively.","Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2016 and \u201817 and is now inclusive of our 2018 estimates. This forecast also reflects the company\u2019s current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 including an estimate of the impact of the settlement with the consortium, which Kevin will address later.","At the bottom of the slide, we recapped the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods of which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.","Now please turn to slide 11 to review our updated estimated financing plans through 2018. As a reminder, on May 19th of this year, SCE&G issued $500 million of 50-year bonds at 5.1%. Also in January, we issued approximately $14 million in equity through our 401k and drill plans before turning off the plans to new shares.","By acquiring shares on the open market to satisfy the needs of these plants, we can further utilize the cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017 and will turn back on the 401k and drill plans to satisfy those needs.","On the debt side and based upon cash flows and planned construction payments to date, we have deferred $325 million of Q4 planned debt issuances and accelerated some issuances from the out years to better align with our expected funding needs. This plan also anticipates debt to be issued at PSNC to fund its anticipated CapEx spending.","While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it is unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses and will continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis.","Now I\u2019d like to discuss our 2016 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on slide 12. Our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized preliminary earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share and our internal target is $4 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each of the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter.","In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of a base rate increase from our new nuclear filing under the BLRA, the accretive impact of the sales of CGT and SCI and our view of their economy. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.","We forecast electric customer growth to be at approximately 1.5% offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower in 2016. We anticipate overall weather normalized retail and electric sales growth for 2016 to decline by approximately 0.2%.","We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2% higher in 2016 than where we project to finish for the end of 2015. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost, property taxes, depreciation and interest.","For the remainder of 2015, exclusive of the taxes on the gains on the sales of the subsidiaries and looking out into 2016, we projected an effective tax rate of approximately 32%. We continue to be cautiously optimistic about our long-term view and are reaffirming GAAP-adjusted weather normalized average annual growth guidance as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the three to five years using a base of 2014\u2019s GAAP-adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Hopefully, this will provide you with some clarity of our view of 2016 as you update your models.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I\u2019d like to begin by addressing the impact that the recent rainfall and flooding at South Carolina had on the new nuclear construction project. As you\u2019ve probably already seen on our website, we estimate that this weather event resulted in a loss of about four days of work effort.","I wanted to clarify that the construction schedule has a contingency for weather delays and other events, so that missed day should not impact planned in-service dates for the new units. We have had very little weather impact to date which is why this event should not have an impact on the project.","Please turn to slide 13. I\u2019d now like to address the public service commission of South Carolina\u2019s unanimous approval for the petition that SCE&G filed in March of this year seeking approval to update the construction milestone schedule as well as the capital cost schedule for the two new nuclear units. The approval of the petition along with the settlement agreement entered into with the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff and South Carolina Energy Users Committee adjusted the commission approved, substantial completion dates to June of 2019 for Unit 2 and June 2020 for Unit 3.","This agreement also allowed for the inclusion of incremental capital cost that totaled $698 million and revised the allowed return on equity to 10.5% from 11% for calculating prospective revised rates sought under the BLRA on or after January 1 of 2016.","Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the site from June. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site. And I\u2019ve labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many other areas that make up what we call the construction table top.","On slide 15, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island and this picture you can see module CA20 on the left side of the slide along with the containment vessel first ring which has been placed on and welded to the lower bowl. If you look through the personnel and equipment hatch openings in the containment vessel ring, you can see super structure of module CA01, which as you recall was placed back in July. We continue to make progress with the fabrication and placement of containment vessels, structure and modules.","Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This exploded view of CA01 through 05 gives you a better feel for how they fit spatially inside said containment vessel. As you may know, we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit 2.","Slide 17 shows a picture of CA02 which will be the next structure of module placed in the Unit 2 containment vessel. Module CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment for filling water storage tank. As you see here, all five sub-modules have been assembled and CA02 is now structurally complete and has been moved outside of the Module Assembly Building or MAB. This module is scheduled to be placed sometime in the first half of 2016.","Slide 18 shows a picture of CA03 which is the west wall of the in-containment we\u2019re filling water storage tank. Four of CA03\u2019s 17 sub modules are on site and three have been fabricated in the MAB.","Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island. Module CA04 was placed inside of the containment vessel lower bowl back in June and the auxiliary building walls as you can see continue to take form.","Slide 20 shows an aerial view of the low profile cooling towers from June. Three of the four cooling towers are now structurally complete with the fourth, 2 Bravo shown on the slide -- sorry -- showed on the slide 21 being about 50% complete.","Please now turn to slide 22. Here you can see the placement of the concrete foundation for Unit 2 Turbine Building first bay. The 6-foot thick base mat took 27 hours to pour and consisted of 2100 cubic yards of concrete. This first bay is the transition from the aux building to the turbine building.","Slide 23 shows the completed Unit 2 transformer base. These transformer base are constructed with reinforcing bar and concrete and serve as a firewall partially in closing transformers. These nine transformer base for Unit 2 were completed during August.","Components continue to arrive on site. On slide 24, you can see some pictures of the Unit 3-Pressurizer arriving in the Port of Charleston. It was then transferred via rail car to the site. The pressurizer will be hard inside the containment vessel and will be used to control the pressure and react to coolant system.","Please now turn to slide 25. As we mentioned during our second quarter call, we filed our annual request for advised rates under the BLRA in May. In response to their request in September, the PSC approved an increase of $64.5 million. The new rates are reflected for bills rendered on or after October 30th.","Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide and as you can see in August, we filed our quarterly status report on our new nuclear project with the commission and the office of regulatory staff for the second quarter of 2015. We intend to file our quarterly status report for the third quarter in November.","I will now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Marsh","Thanks Steve. I\u2019m glad to be with you today to provide some details in connection with our amendment to the EPC agreement for the new AP1000 units at the VC Summer site we announced earlier this week. A number of the key points are summarized on slide 26.","As you know, these plants were being constructed under an EPC agreement with consortium of Westinghouse and Chicago Bridge and Iron Subsidaries, Stone & Webster. Westinghouse has announced that it intends to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I. Following that acquisition, Stone & Webster will continue to be a party to the EPC agreement but as a subsidiary of Westinghouse instead of CB&I.","The amendment to the EPC agreement allows CB&I to exit as guarantee obligation for the project. Obligations under the EPC agreement are joined and several obligations of Westinghouse and Stone &Webster. In the October 2015, amendment provides for Toshiba Corporation, the parent company of Westinghouse, to reaffirm it's a guarantee of the Westinghouse payment obligation.","In exchange for the relief of the CB&I guarantee, the amendment of the EPC contract and an option to fix project cost, SCE&G, Santee Cooper and Westinghouse have agreed to a full resolution and settlement of substantially all loan claims and disputes outstanding under the EPC agreement.","Under this amendment, SCE&G has agreed to pay Westinghouse incremental capital cost of approximately $245 million over the $5.247 million approved in the public service commissions\u2019 recent Order Number 2015-661. This along with estimated escalations and AFUDC would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.113 billion.","The amendment also revises the guarantee to central completion dates of units two and three through August, 31, through 2019 and 2020 respectively. SCE&G share of liquidated damages would increase from $86 million to $509 million. The new liquidated damages are tied to the new guaranteed substantial completion dates and the eligibility of the units to earn federal production tax credits.","Westinghouse also has opportunity to earn from SCE&G completion bonuses of approximately $303 million or $151.5 million for each unit depending on the timing of the plans being placed into service. In addition, this amendment provides SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper an exclusive and irrevocable option until November 1, 2016, to further amend the EPC","agreement to fix for total amount remaining to be paid for the entire scope of work on the project after June 30, 2015 at approximately $3.345 billion, which is SCE&G\u2019s 55% portion of $6.082 billion.","This fixed price option would result in SCE&G\u2019s paying Westinghouse incremental project costs of approximately $774 million over the previous escalated amount approved by the PSC of $6.826 billion. Combined with estimated escalations and AFUDC, this would bring the total gross construction cost of the project to approximately $7.601 billion.","If the fixed price option is exercised, SCE&G share of a delay related liquidated damages amounts previously referred to would then be capped at approximately $372 million or $186 million per unit. The completion bonus to be paid by SCE&G with this option is approximately $165 billion or $82.5 million each unit depending on the timing of the plants being placed in service.","Our team worked very hard to include the unilateral fixed price option into this settlement. We will be evaluating the potential benefits of this option over the next several months. If elected, this option would fix all costs of Westinghouse at an approximate 11% increase over the current PSC approved budget.","We along with our partner, Santee Copper believe this option has significant value. Once final evaluation of this option is complete, we will discuss with the South Carolina office of Regulatory Staff, our conclusion regarding our decision whether to exercise the option and make a filing with the public service commission of South Carolina.","And important part of the amendment is the development of a new revised construction payment milestone schedule. Over the next five months or until the new payment schedule is agreed upon, SCE&G will make monthly payments of approximately $100 million per month, which our share is $55 million.","Thereafter, payments will be made to Westinghouse based on construction milestones achieved. After this milestone schedule is agreed upon and if the fixed price option is elected and approved, our CapEx schedule Jimmy reviewed on slide 10 will be updated and our financing schedule will be confirmed as well.","The amendment also modifies the EPC agreement to explicitly define what constitutes a change in law to reduce the likelihood of certain commercial disputes. A Dispute Resolution Board will be established for resolution of disputes as the requirement or ability to bring suit before substantial completion of the project is then eliminated.","Finally, I\u2019m excited to have full cooperation involved in the project. Fluor was established in South Carolina and has a deep nuclear pedigree with this nuclear division being headquarter in Greenville, South Carolina. We\u2019ve had a long relationship with Fluor and believe they have an excellent record of delivering on commitments.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hi. Good afternoon, guys.","Kevin Marsh","Hey Andrew.","Andrew Weisel","First question is on the option to switch to the fixed costs for the construction. What would be some of the reasons not to do it? You mentioned a lot of benefits. What might be some reasons why you won\u2019t exercise it and when do you think you might make that decision?","Kevin Marsh","Well, we will make the decision over the next 6 to 12 months. We have 12 months to make the final decision. We want to take some time to let Fluor get acclimated to the project and have them look at the project schedule, the timetable associated with the completion dates and get their opinion combined with our valuation of how they intend to approach the completion of the project. So, we can evaluate the option we are under today, which is to complete the project with the target pricing along with the fixed and firm. Both of the project will have to be done is in that target category, which means we pay the costs that they incur. That\u2019s important to us because when we get their feedback on the achievement of the milestones and what risks we think we may have there. We think we\u2019ve strengthened our risk position there because we\u2019ve increased the LDs on the project significantly. I think at 6 times if we go under the existing option today.","So, once we get the change to fully evaluate the schedule, the new completion dates along with their oversight and our complete evaluation, I think we will be in a better position to make that decision. We certainly think the fixed price option is very appealing. We work hard to negotiate that option into our settlement because it does give us additional protections for rising cost. Certainly, interest rates and projected escalation rates between now and the time we make that decision will have an impact on which way we might so. But we just need some more time to evaluate that more fully.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. But it sounds like you are leaning towards taking that option or is it -- do you seem to take that?","Kevin Marsh","No. I wouldn\u2019t make that decision today. I still think it\u2019s very appealing and certainly it gives us a backstop if we weren\u2019t comfortable with the existing option. But I don\u2019t want to leave the impression that we have made that decision today because we want that time to evaluate where the projects going, what we think interest rates might do in the future, what impact that could have on escalation and just the overall time schedule,","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Okay. Next question is my understanding is that so far your payment schedule hasn\u2019t really been based on the completion of milestones, so you need to have a true-up of what\u2019s been paid so far. Are you expecting to be ahead or behind? In other words, are you expecting to get some cash back from cost over today?","Kevin Marsh","We are certainly ahead on the schedule because that was one of the things that drove but it was behind many of the speeds on the project that we resolved with this amendment. In the original agreement, there were two types of payments we made. Some of those were based on time, just passing the timetable on the schedule and others were based on actual work done. That got to be fairly contentious because we felt like, in some circumstances we were being billed for work that was not being completed, consistently with the schedule we had agreed to in the original contract.","What this amendment does is it resolves those differences. So everything that\u2019s being paid today is, I think I\u2019m confident saying that was below -- it's actually been performing on the project. We are certainly not ahead of schedule. So what we will do is we are going to work with Westinghouse in Fluor very carefully to come up with a new construction payment milestone schedule. We will take about five months to do that.","We\u2019ve estimated during that time. On a 100% basis, we will be paying $100 million per month and then at the end of six months that will be trued-up. So it won\u2019t be ahead or behind at that point. And then from that point on, once we agree to the schedule, payments will be made as milestones are achieved and that will be very simply. If the works done they will be paid. If the works not done in accordance with the schedule regardless how much time has passed, there won\u2019t be a payment required from us.","Jimmy Addison","So that $100 million is 100% basis, so our 55% share will be $55 million.","Andrew Weisel","That\u2019s right. Thanks Steve. Okay. And all of that is embedded in the financing slide you showed through 2018?","Kevin Marsh","It is, Andrew. So what we did in updating that schedule is simply took the formula that Kevin and Steve just alluded to and recast the first seven months according to that basis and then the next five months of 2016, we will just use an estimate of what we had there, existing. So, we have at least improved for what we know for those first five to seven months and we are just going to need to refresh everything once we get to that point where we are ready to take this before the commission and we will refresh our CapEx and financing schedule at that point.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Great. And then just lastly, since we assume that the financing plans being, equity in particular assumes no bonus depreciation and what will that look like if you do have an extension?","Jimmy Addison","Bonus depreciation is in the ballpark of $75 million a year. So that\u2019s the value of it to us. And you are right, it does not assume that.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you very much.","Jimmy Addison","Thank you.","Kevin Marsh","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","The next question will come from Julien Dumoulin Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Hi. Good afternoon.","Kevin Marsh","Good afternoon.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","So with the depreciation benefits in earnings now helping you, I supposed and you tell me drive towards close to your authorized ROE, how are you thinking about your earnings growth rate here? Obviously, it\u2019s better than the 3 to 6, just thinking more dramatically here.","Kevin Marsh","Yeah. First of all, we do -- we have historically done and had an informal kind of commitment with the commission to refresh your depreciation rates every five years or so. And that\u2019s simple enough to do and get into the rate process when you have inflation related driven rate case every two, three, four years. Since we have this strategy of staying out of any base rate increases other than the BLRA, we were getting on the outside of that timeframe. So, we refreshed it, went to the commission, ask them to approve it, they did and we\u2019ve implemented that now for 2015 and forward.","So it is a, kind of a one-time reset if you will. Ultimately, it will all be kind of put back into the whole rate process at some point down the road or after the BLRA is over and the new units are in place. But in the mean time, you can say we might be on the upper edge or slightly outside the band in the very short run. But that guidance is a three to five year intermediate band and not just a one year band. So, I don\u2019t know that that really puts us outside of it, outside of that three to five year band because we reset that every year.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Right. But just to clarify real quickly, in terms of earning your ROE next year, there is no reason why this step-up that you are seeing with the depreciation study that\u2019s a real sustainable benefit occurring to you guys.","Kevin Marsh","It is.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Until the next rate case, presumably as you said.","Kevin Marsh","That\u2019s right and everything gets reset. But we are comfortable with our strategy of earning in that 9% to 10.25% range on the base electric business for the next three years.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Got it.","Kevin Marsh","Based on what we know today obviously.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Right. And then let me cut back to the sales growth expectations, did I hear you right in saying a slight decline next year in the baseline forecast for the '16 guidance and can you expand on why that might be given the year-to-date experience?","Kevin Marsh","Yeah, the year-to-date experience is inconsistent with the last two years. If we\u2019re confident that we\u2019re going to get growth year-over-year for '15 to '16, we would have more upside. And honestly, I hope we experienced that because that\u2019s a great signal of the economy in South Carolina if that\u2019s the case. But at this point, our best modeling says that for the first time there will be almost a wash between the incremental margin from new customers offset by the slight margin decline from all customers due to energy efficiency etcetera.","And honestly, that\u2019s a good sign for us because as our whole industry has dealt with the last several years the customer growth has been overwhelmed by the efficiency in the decline in average use. So we are glad we are back to be able to project the breakeven and hope we have the challenge that you alluded to because that\u2019s good news for the economy.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Right. And then there is no specific customer class here that you\u2019re highlighting that you would drive that, right?","Kevin Marsh","No, but the predominant of it is in the residential commercial classes.","Julien Dumoulin Smith","Right, absolutely. All right. Great. Well, thank you.","Kevin Marsh","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Hey, guys, congratulations on a settlement.","Kevin Marsh","Thank you, Jim.","Jim von Riesemann","I just wanted to follow up on some of the Julien\u2019s questions. How much is the depreciation affects post the impact fourth quarter earnings?","Jimmy Addison","Jim, it\u2019s about a $0.03 per quarter run rate, so $0.12 a year.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And then, so I guess the follow-up question to that is, your trailing 12 is what 365, 366 and your internal midpoint before was 370 on a weather normalized basis. Do you expect to hit that number?","Jimmy Addison","Do we expect to hit which number?","Jim von Riesemann","The 370 number, your internal target number?","Jimmy Addison","We do.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. Secondly, switching over to the settlement, are the bonus payments included in the capital cost, are those incremental?","Jimmy Addison","They would be incremental, Jim. They are not included in the base costs we disclosed in the amendment.","Jim von Riesemann","Are those shareholders born or customer born?","Jimmy Addison","That has not been determined. They will be before the commission and have a chance to explain both of these options and then which one we choose to go with. Since we don\u2019t know exactly whether or not those will be paid out or what amounts it might be paid out in for one or both things because it\u2019s done on a per unit basis. We can\u2019t exactly determine if it\u2019s going to be paid.","We would like to have these projects completed on time and have that a nice problem to have. We will address that with the commission, unlikely to ask commission how we proceed that and my recommendation would be we wait till the end of the project to see where the final cost comes in. So that\u2019s most likely recommendation to the commission since we can\u2019t determine exactly what that would be today and that might be influenced by which option we take too.","Jim von Riesemann","Have you guys chat with the rating agencies yet?","Kevin Marsh","Yes.","Jim von Riesemann","What was the response?","Kevin Marsh","Well, those not published anything yet, I expect they will in the near term, but just to characterize the oral discussions I think it was generally neutral deposit with each of the agencies.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. Can you just talk about? And then lastly, could you talk about how the risk get rebucketed from under this settlement, I mean obviously you\u2019ve absorbed some of your own risk that you bought, but how much -- what sort of risk would you say that you still retain and the risk that the construction consortium retains?","Kevin Marsh","Well, I would say our risk profile under either options is significantly enhanced. And in fact, under the existing option that we\u2019ve resolved all of these outstanding issues eliminates the risk of potential litigations and there was issues in the risk that are just inherent and going through that process over time. And I think the fact that we\u2019ve significantly raised the liquidated damages gives us a lot more protection under the existing contracts arrangement, our liquidity damages are 6 times what they were in the original contract.","We still bear the risk of potential increased escalation and just increased interest expense during that time on the targeted dollars and the majority dollars to be spent between now and the completion of the project or in that target bucket. But I think when you add all of those together, our risk profile is certainly reduced from where it was before we signed the amendment.","On the fixed price option that we have in front of us, I think that really enhances our risk profile as we shift that escalation risk back to Westinghouse and our only risk would be changes in law or change orders it might be associated with the project and we still got incentives payable under either option, it would encourage them to complete the units on time. So anything that helps that happen in accordance with the schedule and the guaranteed completion date would lower our risk profile.","Steve Byrne","Jim, this is Steve. I would give one amplification to that under either scenario I think we have enhanced our risk profile because where we get into commercial disputes with the consortium today, they largely revolve around the definition of a change in law and they would use the term commercially driven or regulatory driven change and the language around changes that we\u2019ve worked on and incorporate into this agreement significantly restricts what will be allowed as a regulatory driven change. So we certainly improved it from that perspective.","We also have a contract, the EPC contract, remember that was signed in about 2008, early '08 and that was based on the -- at that time our current revision of the design certification document or DCD which is about 16. We were licensed to Rev 19. So they submitted a couple of revisions between signing it and the final approval. And so that has caused us some commercial issues in the interim and we resolved that with this agreement by updating the contract to DCD Rev 19 which is what we\u2019re licensed to.","Kevin Marsh","And Jim so I will get a pitch in on this and one other from a financial perspective. And under the old agreement anytime we disputed an invoice, we paid 90% of it as you are aware. Under the new arrangement if we disputed, we don\u2019t pay anything and we get a fairly rapid resolution from a resolution board. So we think that\u2019s a much better situation too to get all the parties to the table and of course there is one less probably to get to the table than it was in the past.","Jim von Riesemann","So let me ask like a worse case basis type question, so has Fluor and Westinghouse looked at the quality of work that has been done by CB&I?","Kevin Marsh","Yeah, I think that Fluor has not had an opportunity to look at the quality. Fluor will not take over until the deal is effective. There is a period of time for regulatory approvals of the deal, standard stuff, perhaps compete slightly by the fact that Toshiba is a foreign entity. So there are regulatory approvals that need to take place, that\u2019s why we think that that will be about a 45-day window and that\u2019s when Fluor will have their first opportunity to assess things like quality.","But Westinghouse has had an opportunity to assess quality as of our folks. And so we don\u2019t just rely on the quality from the vendor in this case CB&I. We have our own quality group and own quality inspectors and we send our folks not just at the site, but we will send them to facilities that are manufacturing components whether it would be CB&I or somebody else and we will send them whether it\u2019s domestically or internationally. Our QA, QC inspectors have got a lot of stamps on their passports. So we will be able to assure Fluor of the quality in construction so far.","Jim von Riesemann","So you are happy with the quality so there is going to be no aha moment is what you\u2019re saying?","Kevin Marsh","Yeah, we don\u2019t anticipate any aha moment.","Jim von Riesemann","Great. Thank you.","Kevin Marsh","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","The next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Kevin Marsh","Hey, Travis.","Travis Miller","Just wondering on this regulatory stuff in terms of a settlement. One, how much were regulators involved in this, either the federal level or state level? Was anybody involved and what was that makeup in terms of regulatory involvement?","Kevin Marsh","They were not directly involved into negotiations. Certainly we briefed also regulatory staff before we made up the final announcement of the settlement agreement. It was our commitment to the commission when we were in there this year talking about the contract changes and getting approvals at that time from the existing contracts that we would come back to them and let them know of any changes in the status of the project.","So we expect to be before the commission here in the near future and ex-partake communication which is a quickest way for us to get in front of them and educate them on more of the details of the contractual amendments involved and how the options would work for the company going forward. And of course once we make the final decision, we would be obligated to go back and make that filing to adjust the timetables and the entity -- excuse me and the cost associated with it.","Travis Miller","Okay. You answered most of my second question there in terms of the regulatory process there, but is there a chance that regulators could deny the settlement, say, it\u2019s not in customers interest?","Kevin Marsh","Certainly they have got that option every time we go in, but our commission has been very supportive of what we\u2019ve done on this project in the past. They view it as critical not just to provide energy to customers of South Carolina, but it\u2019s a key component of our response to the 111(d) Clean Power Plan. So it is critical to not just us but also for our partners Santee Cooper. So we feel like we are within the guidelines of the challenges we put before us to try to complete the project depending on which option we elect.","We will go back and present our case to the commission as to why we decided to continue down the same path, why we believe it\u2019s the best interest to elect the fixed option and they generally listen to our testimony and evaluated that and made a fair decision. I certainly can\u2019t guarantee that, but I feel like we would do a good job explaining our position to the commission in a way that they could make a very fair valuation of our election.","Travis Miller","Okay. And what kind of timeline would that be on?","Kevin Marsh","When we make the decision or once we make the filing, they have six months to render a decision. So if we were to make a decision for example to elect the fixed price option in early June next year, they will have to make that decision by early December. So it\u2019s a six month window from start to finish.","Travis Miller","Got it. Thanks so much. I appreciate it.","Kevin Marsh","Yes, sir.","Operator","The next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Good afternoon.","Kevin Marsh","Hey Paul.","Paul Patterson","Does the fixed price option cover all materials and labor or just some of the\u2026?","Kevin Marsh","It covers all remaining work to be done under the contract from now or actually from June 15th until completion.","Paul Patterson","So it covers everything.","Kevin Marsh","Yes.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then is there any change in your financing expectations or anything as a result of if you did move to the fixed price, things like that?","Kevin Marsh","Paul, let me go back and add one thing to my previous answer, it does cover the construction cost. We still have transmission work to be done, but that\u2019s included in the total expected project cost we provided. So those numbers all included then because the transmission is outside of the EPC contract as well as owners cost.","Paul Patterson","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","And on to your next question about financing, no change in our philosophy of 50-50 debt and equity, we just need to get through the process of reassessing with Fluor, making our option choice going to the commission and getting that approval hopefully. And then recasting the payments accordingly and confirm our financing schedule to that.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then the -- there is some fabrication discussion of moving the fabrication from Florida to other places, is that affected by the amended agreement?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Paul, this is Steve. The discussion about our facility in Florida that was fabricating some of the sub-modules, that was going to be the case whether we stayed under the existing contract or go under, either the two options that we\u2019re proposing.","So there's a facility in Florida and they are moving that work from that facility in Florida back to the Lake Charles facility for the trailing unit. And for the leading unit we\u2019re actually taking those components to our site and we\u2019re finishing the sub-module fabrication there before we found them into the larger modules.","Paul Patterson","And why is that, why isn\u2019t being from, what was the reason for the change?","Steve Byrne","I think its two things, one it\u2019s that that facility had some commercial issues between themselves and CB&I. And secondly, they had a lot of work to do, things were backing up. They did have some quality issues while they came up speed and we just think we can do it more expeditiously at our site.","Paul Patterson","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","The next question will come from Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.","Feliks Kerman","Hi. Good afternoon. Congratulations on the quarter. So this was answered, just wanted to clarify. In our 2016 guidance number, what ROE are we assuming for the base electric business?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. We have been explicit about on ROE, but today we\u2019re at about 9.7% and more comfortable will be in the band of 9% to 10.25% for the next three years based on our assumptions to-date.","Feliks Kerman","So is it okay to assume that the next time we follow rate case there would be at the three-year cycle?","Steve Byrne","We clearly said our strategy is to not follow base rate increase while we\u2019re during these nuclear peak construction years, so, yes, that is a safe assumption.","Feliks Kerman","Okay. Thank you.","Steve Byrne","Sure.","Operator","The next question will comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hey, guys. Congrats on the arrangement with Westinghouse, Toshiba, et cetera. Sounds like a great deal and look forward to chatting with you about it in more detail at EI. A couple of minor questions, first of all, can you give us an update on how 2015 nuclear CapEx is progressing? I noticed the table didn\u2019t have 2015 numbers on it. Just wanted to see relative to your last disclosure, whether there's been any change to the expected spend this year on the project?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Michael, we are a little behind our expected spend there, I\u2019d say in the $100 million or so range. I don't know that a lot of that will be made up between obviously, with only a couple months left in the transition going on them, but that\u2019s kind of where we are through the year -- through to-date.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. So we should bring down our 2015 number a little bit and just assume that\u2019s embedded in either those 2016 to \u201818 timeline or in the last year or so of the project?","Steve Byrne","You can in your assumptions, I would tell you that from our basis, it\u2019s in our guidance, both for \u201815 and \u201916.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Real quick on the DNA study and the impact, I want to make sure I\u2019m capturing the EPS impact to this correctly. So next year what is the incremental EPS impact in 2016 that you're not going to recognize in 2015?","Steve Byrne","About $0.06 will impact 2015 and an incremental $0.06 in 2016 for an aggregate $0.12 and that will be the run rate for \u201816 forward.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And can you -- I want to make sure I tie that back. In the slide deck it mentions $0.10 in this quarter -- in third quarter, is that just, its not the full $0.10 because of rate credit that was done or the reduction that was done on the deferred fuel balance?","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s exactly right. So we did record three quarters worth in 2015 into third quarter because it applied back to January 1st, but the first two quarters went to offset the fuel and so we only got net income impact of one quarter in \u201815 though the Q3 recording.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Last thing and looking at the CapEx schedule, the utility CapEx in North Carolina, the gas utility there, seems like that a good bit higher when we get out to 2017 and 2018. Can you talk about that, talk about the timing and plans for potential rate case filings? And how you would or are there other mechanisms that can give you rate relief after spending significant capital level there?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Well, obviously, the low price in natural gas is driven a lot of opportunity for industry for electric generation from gas plants, et cetera, and that is certainly been the case in North Carolina.","So we\u2019ve had enough lot of opportunities that have popped up. We have executed some contracts in the last quarter or two that have driven this need to enhance some of our existing plants to grow the transmission system, so that was really driving these numbers.","And clearly, it\u2019s starting to drive down the earned return and so it will drive the need for a rate proceeding at sometime in the near future. We\u2019ve not made any final decisions on that, but I expect we will have someone announcement around that in 2016.","Michael Lapides","Got it. So maybe a case in '16 implemented in '17 or a case in '17 implemented in '18, kind of somewhere in that time horizon?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Again, haven\u2019t made any final decisions, but today I would say it\u2019s more likely your first scenario than the second.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Steve Byrne","Sure.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","Hi. Good afternoon.","Steve Byrne","Hey, Dan.","Dan Jenkins","Just kind of following on Michael\u2019s question there on the CapEx changes. And I was looking at the prior one and it looks like 2016 is up by about $260 million or now about a $120 million and 2017 is up by about a $120 million versus why you had in last quarter slides, is that due to the additional delays? Or is that due to the work not getting done in 2015 is being pushed in 2016? Or how should I think about that?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Dan, are you talking about the total CapEx because the numbers I have are that we\u2019re up about $60 million for '16 and down about $60 million for '17 overall.","Dan Jenkins","I'm looking at the bottom of the total estimated capital expenditures at the bottom.","Steve Byrne","We only have about -- sorry, you go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","The slide I\u2019m looking at last quarter for '16 estimated at'17 38 and for '17 at 1617.","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s not what I have here in front of me. We\u2019ll have to clear that up.","Dan Jenkins","This is what I -- I\u2019m just holding up part from the website so\u2026","Steve Byrne","Let me give you a little color on what we have changed. So we\u2019ve made the best estimate we can on the nuclear as I described earlier for 2016 based upon the revised agreement. The other thing we've done is there are reductions in the SCE&G base electric business, just based upon our commitment to scrub the CapEx for that business and try to avoid any base electric rate increases.","The other significant change is adding the CapEx to the North Carolina gas system PSNC Energy and so we added about 75 in '16 and 46 in '17 for PSNC. So those are the three large changes. For '16, 135 down in electric, 53 -- 75 up at PSNC and 115 up in nuclear.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Then on a question on slide eight on the sales and customer growth.","Steve Byrne","Yeah.","Dan Jenkins","And again looking at last quarter\u2019s release, I realized these are 12 -- I\u2019m looking at the table at the bottom for kilowatt hours, the last I realize this is 12 months ending numbers but there are big changes and why they\u2019re normalized so that the residential went from basically negative 30 basis points to a positive 170 and commercial from positive 30 to positive 140. And then conversely, the industrial went from 3.8% to under 2.3%. So are you seeing that kind of big changes from quarter-to-quarter? And can you give me some more color on what's going on in the demand from the various customer segments?","Steve Byrne","We are seeing that kind of change from quarter-to-quarter. And I would tell you that it probably has more to do with the slide before that on the economy than anything else in our opinion. Let me give you a little more depth on that. So as I said in my earlier prepared comments, there are 80,000 more South Carolinians working today than they were a year ago.","The unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6 to 5.7, but that only tells part of the story. The workforce has expanded 3%. So if the workforce were the same level today than it were a year ago, the unemployment rate would be less than 3% in South Carolina. So the industrial recruitment in the state has been a real homerun. Our governor has made that central to a platform and she has been extremely successful.","And we\u2019ve seen it in the RNC markets as a result of that. Now contrast that to North Carolina where the workforce is expanded 1.8% contrasted to Georgia where it\u2019s actually slightly down almost breakeven year-over-year. The South Carolina is really growing.","Dan Jenkins","I guess kind of the concern though is the big slowdown in the industrial sector and what that might being going forward, do you have any color down as to why that drop so much?","Steve Byrne","I don\u2019t have any specific, no large closings or anything like that that has driven that I\u2019m aware of. I\u2019m not too concerned about that in the short run. I know the pipeline of projects that we\u2019re talking about that could be coming around the corner. I was just met this week with two, with our head of industrial area about two new potential large projects in the area.","So I really don\u2019t have any specific concern there. I think some of those might be related to real-time pricing customers that chose to come off the system during the heat of the summer rather than pay some of the prices they might have had to pay.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then my last set of questions is related to the nuclear construction schedule and kind of the critical mix kind of critical path items. It sounds like maybe for unit three it\u2019s the CA02. Is that correct?","Steve Byrne","Say again, Dan.","Dan Jenkins","The critical path items both for Unit 2 and 3, so is the next one for Unit 2 that CA02 that you said is going to be placed in first half of \u201816 or is there something else before that?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. The next one of the structural modules to be placed will be that CA02 that you mentioned. The critical path right now on the units really is still running through the shield building. And we did placed first role of those shield building panels last quarter and we anticipate doing some more of those in the near future. But the critical path for the units really for both units still run through that shield building. We see the shield building panels, fit up the shield building panels and then pour the concrete in the panels, once they\u2019re in place and welded.","Dan Jenkins","What about so for Unit 3, is it -- it's pretty much the same as Unit 2 or is there given that there is a year difference in kind of the \u2026","Steve Byrne","Now Dan, it\u2019s basically the same story three and three.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s all I had.","Steve Byrne","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Sorry. Our next question will come from Mitchell Moss of Lord, Abbett. Please go ahead.","Mitchell Moss","Hi, just want to get a couple clarifications on the nuclear cost. Looking at the slide with -- that\u2019s show different option. I\u2019m sorry -- I\u2019m aging forward to that.","Steve Byrne","That slide 26.","Mitchell Moss","Slide 26, yeah. Of the updated amounts comparing the old order to the amended EPC, is there a rough break down how much of that is related to the two months delay in the substantial complete dates versus increase in construction cost or others stuff?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. The biggest part of that would be about $10 million a month and owners cost, so approximately $20 million of that would be related to that category.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. And then if I think about the added cost of going from the amended EPC to the fixed price options, it looks like it's around $500 million, I guess, of the additional project costs. If I do the math from prior presentations, 2017 to 2019 CapEx is projected to be around $2 billion. So, should I think that that incremental $500 million effectively would fix but 2017 to 2019. If you are not going to make your decision necessarily until late 2016 then effectively you\u2019re really just fixing the 2017 to 2019 CapEx?","Kevin Marsh","Well, Mitchell, we are fixing, if we elect the fixed price options but it doesn\u2019t directly correlate any kind of the specific burn rate. Remember the real different as you look there are about $500 million difference that you point out that really is the risk that the contractor will price and to fix it to us.","So what you\u2019re doing is you are paying risk premium and then they have to make assumptions around things like inflation what the escalation rates are going to be. So that really is -- was a negotiated number but it really is reflective of the risk but now the contractor will have to take on.","Jimmy Addison","Mitchell, we\u2019re reflective of all payments made after June 15th of this year. If we elect the fixed price option, anything we pay or paid since June up until the time we elect that option, we get credit for 100%.","Steve Byrne","Mitchell, the CapEx schedule on page 10, we\u2019ve made our best estimate of how those amendments will affect the cash flow in the short term. But as Kevin said in his prepared comments, once this milestone payment schedule is developed, we are going to have to confirm the CapEx schedule, no matter which option we go with to match that. So those numbers will change. I\u2019m sure I just don't know exactly at this point.","Mitchell Moss","Sorry. They will change based on what?","Jimmy Addison","The milestone payment schedule that Kevin covered earlier, so we are going to develop -- this milestone payment schedule is going to be tied to specific milestones being accomplished. And then we\u2019ll confirm our CapEx and financing schedule to that depended upon which option we elect.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. But once the fixed price option is selected that milestone payment schedule won't matter so much?","Kevin Marsh","No. It will. It is really critical because what we are going to do here from the next four or five month is develop the schedule. So there's clarity as to what need to be completed for a payment to be made to Westinghouse. And so once that schedule is completed there will be dollars assigned to that if we continue under the existing contract. And then there will be the dollars assigned to that if we were going under the fixed price contract.","So the schedule will remain employed under either option. But the payment that go along with it will be based on whether we take the fixed price option or continue under the option we\u2019re working under today.","Jimmy Addison","So the contrast that we are going to make any payments in the future after this payment schedule is agreed to based upon the calendar, they are going to based upon actual results.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. Thank you very much.","Kevin Marsh","Yes, sir.","Operator","[Operator Instruction] We have a follow-up question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, there again. Sorry to follow-up here. I just wanted to reach back on this fixed price auction and just kind of understand where the potential liabilities still lie on your side if there is indeed a protracted schedule here?","So, could you perhaps give us a sense a little bit more? I know you covered a little bit with Paul. But to the extent, you have a timeline shift, where are you responsible, what specific costs do you responsible for in the fixed price options that you\u2019ve laid out if you choose to go that way?","Kevin Marsh","Okay. The total fixed price options would be $7.601 billion as we\u2019ve laid out on slide 26. It\u2019s the third or fourth lying down. That would be the total expected project cost. Of that, the capital cost portion over the year, the construction contract, EPC contract will be $6.757 billion. So the additional amount would be escalation to date on the existing work that's been done.","And then some additional dollars, the additional $20 million associated with the schedule moving out two months for owner\u2019s cost. Both of that is fixed in the fixed price contract, and that would be based on the guaranteed substantial completion dates of unit two, August of 2019, and unit three August of 2020. And the liquidated damages are key to all of us for each of those dates for specific units.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. But, could you give us a sense of how much would be exposed to and by what variables? If you were to have for instance, the shift off of that August of 2019 and 2020 date? Just to kind of give us a sense of the magnitude there, I appreciate that a lot of it would be presumably fixed but..?","Steve Byrne","Julien. This is Steve. The only thing that would not be fixed would be the things that we would be responsible before outside of the EPC contract, so that will be our owners\u2019 cost and then the transmission. But we can finish the transmission even if the plans are not finished. So really, it comes down just to owners\u2019 costs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And can you remind us what that is per month?","Kevin Marsh","Yeah. We are looking at a burn rate and owners\u2019 costs at somewhere in the range of $10 million a month.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. Excellent. Well. Thank you again.","Kevin Marsh","Yes, sir.","Operator","The next question will be a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. I\u2019m going to go back to depreciation a second if you guys don\u2019t mind. So what were the assets that were changed in the depreciation lines to get such a big number on an EPS business? I\u2019m sorry I forgot that.","Kevin Marsh","No. I don\u2019t know that you forgot. And I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s been published anywhere. But what we really did, we refreshed our entire comprehensive depreciation study across the whole electric systems. So it includes the T&D and the generation system.","Jim von Riesemann","What gen -- can you buck it which was -- might have been generation versus the T&D? And then I\u2019m trying to think what\u2019s your big generation assets are because the older ones already got a long useful life, right.","Kevin Marsh","Yeah. We are down to about five significant generating plants outside of new nuclear. So, I really can't give you the buckets here, Jim. You can probably go to the PSC website and get more details on it and publicly there.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay.","Jimmy Addison","But Jim -- big picture, Jim, it is trying to match up the real expected lives to the depreciation schedule. And for example, at our nuclear facilities, we would anticipate that as opposed to just the 20-year life extension that we will be pursuing a second life extension. So that would take that plant out to 80 years total. And then we are using actual history on some of the plants that we've been operating and we are extending the depreciation scales out on those plants to get match up with what we really think is the useful life.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. That\u2019s what I was after. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Fishman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","David Fishman","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just have a quick follow-up on what Michael asked about. I was just wondering does PSNC have a historical or forward test years.","Kevin Marsh","Historical.","David Fishman","Historical. All right. Great. Thank you.","Kevin Marsh","Yes.","David Fishman","Congrats again.","Operator","And our next question will be a follow-up from Feliks Kerman of Visium Asset Management. Please go ahead.","Feliks Kerman","Hi. Thank you. Just a quick follow-up. When we come down to the point of making decision between the fixed option and the current, would it makes sense to get commission approval prior to choosing the fixed option or how should we think about that?","Kevin Marsh","No. The way the process would work is we have an obligation to go back to the commission, if there was a change in the price, the capital call schedule that they\u2019ve already approved. So either option would require us to go to the condition at some point, so we need to make an election of which options we believe is superior.","So, we can go back to the commission, ask for approval of that option. It wouldn\u2019t be likely that we will go back to a commission and say you tell us which one you like and we will hit down that road. They will look for us to make a recommendation, a specific recommendation to them.","Feliks Kerman","And when can we expect that to happen.","Kevin Marsh","We have 12 months from the effective date to make that option. So -- excuse me, it run in November 1, 2016, that\u2019s the specific date in the contract.","Feliks Kerman","Okay. Thank you.","Kevin Marsh","When we will go and ask for it?","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well. Thank you very much and certainly so far this year has been very eventful. We are very pleased with our progress with the resolutions to the negotiations and with our financial results through the first three quarters. We continue to focus on the new nuclear construction and on operating all of our business in a safe and reliable manner. And we thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 24, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2014.","Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer for SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to on this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project directly on our website at scana.com.

Addison","Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the first quarter of 2014 were $1.37 per share compared to $1.13 per share in the same quarter of 2013. Our earnings in the first quarter are reflective of ending the electric weather normalization pilot in December 2013, as mentioned on the year-end call. The company's financials will now be impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business. Accordingly, the improved results in the first quarter are attributable to higher electric margins due primarily to the abnormally cold winter weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth along with higher gas margins. These higher margins were partially offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.","Now on Slide 4, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2014 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.21 compared to 2013, driven largely by higher electric margins due primarily to a benefit of $0.10 of abnormal weather, a Base Load Review Act rate increase and customer growth, as well as higher gas margins. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, as well as expenses related to our capital program, including the property taxes, depreciation and share dilution.","PSNC's earnings for the first quarter of 2014, shown in red, were $0.24 per share, consistent with the first quarter of 2013. Increased margins from customer growth were offset by higher depreciation and share dilution.","SCANA Energy, our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, reported first quarter 2014 earnings of $0.16 per share, consistent with our first quarter of 2013. A benefit of $0.05 of incremental volume, due to abnormally cold weather during the quarter, was offset by higher commodity prices experienced in serving the incremental volumes and price competition.","SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported earnings of $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2014 compared to $0.05 per share in the prior year.","I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 5. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. So far, in 2014, companies have announced plans to invest approximately $160 million with expectations of creating approximately 1,200 jobs in our Carolinas territories.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for our 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. While all these states continue to show marked improvement, the Carolinas are benefiting greatly from the industrial expansion. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.5%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.6%.","Slide 6 is an interesting slide I came across recently related to the real estate investment community. Based on their projections, over the next 20 years, 43% of the U.S. population growth will be concentrated in 10 strategic growth corridors. As you can see in the illustration, a couple of those main corridors run through the Carolinas and Georgia, passing through the geographic footprint of all of our major subsidiaries.","Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates for the 12 months ended March 31 are 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina added customers at a 2.3% rate.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter and 12 months ended March 31, 2014. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 3.6% for the first quarter and 0.5% on a 12-month-ended basis.","Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.3 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended March 31, 2014, in the electric business is approximately 10.2%, well within our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. In November of last year, the South Carolina PSC approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base and increased rates just under 2.9%. As Steve will discuss shortly, we will be filing our new request for revised rates in May. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.","Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule, exclusive of BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. The CapEx at new nuclear reflects Westinghouse and CB&I's projected cash flow estimates, as adjusted by the company, supporting the current in-service ranges for Units 2 and 3. These estimates provide a preliminary high-level estimate of the cash flows. At the bottom is our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Slide 10 presents the estimated net change to the cash flows and incremental new nuclear CWIP. The incremental new nuclear CWIP is lower in 2014 than our previous estimate, driven by the delay in achieving certain construction milestones during the 12-month period. An example of the milestone delay is CA-20, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes.","Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. This slide is consistent with the forecast from our last call.","Now on Slide 12. We're reaffirming our earnings guidance at $3.45 to $3.65 per basic earnings per share, along with our internal target of $3.55 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the next 3- to 5-year period.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. Please turn to Slide 13. As we have stated before, the company's current construction schedule indicates the in-service range for Unit 2 is between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This date is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month scheduled contingency. The in-service date for Unit 3 will be roughly 12 months after Unit 2.","As the company noted in its last BLRA filing, the consortium is currently re-baselining the Unit 2 and Unit 3 consortium schedules to incorporate a more detailed evaluation of the engineering and procurement activities and to provide a detailed reassessment of the impact of the revised Units 2 and 3 schedules on engineering and design resource allocations, procurement schedules, construction work efficiencies and other items. Although we do not yet have a re-baselined schedule, we believe, based on discussions with the consortium, that the in-service dates for the new units will be within the 18-month PSC-allowed construction contingency.","I'll now provide a brief update to the on-hook dates for some of the structural modules. As I previously mentioned, the on-hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will allow it to be placed on the hook of the Heavy Lift Derrick.","Module CA-20, seen on Slide 14, is an auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. Finishing touches are taking place on this module inside of the Module Assembly Building and it is scheduled for on-hook date in May. This on-hook date was amended from Q1 2014 to May of 2014 earlier this month due to inclement weather from 2 ice storms, which closed the site for approximately 1 week; Chicago Bridge and Iron performance and production-related delays in the aligning and welding of submodules; and the incorporation of lessons learned from setting the same module at the Vogtle site a few weeks earlier.","Module CA-01, on Slide 15, is the steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of China sites. We're amending our anticipated on-hook date for this module from Q3 of 2014 to Q3 -- or Q4 2014. As with CA-20, we have modified the date to take this into account -- or to take into account the lost time due to the CB&I self-imposed stop work order at their Lake Charles facility that has now been lifted and CB&I performance and production-related experience. Submodules for CA-01 have started to arrive, and on-site fabrication on this module should begin shortly.","Module CA-03, on Slide 16, it's the southwest wall of the in-reactor water storage tank, located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. The consortium have moved fabrication of this module to a facility in Florida from a facility in North Charleston, South Carolina. This module has an anticipated on-hook date of Q4 2014.","Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2, shown on Slide 17, is the second ring of the containment vessel. This structure has a scheduled on-hook date of Q4 2014. The first ring of Unit 2 containment vessel, which I'll show you a picture of shortly, is scheduled to be placed during the second quarter of 2014.","On Slide 18, you can see a summary that outlines the on-hook dates for these 4 modules, as well as their current status. I'd now like to discuss some of the recent activities at the site.","Slide 19 presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site. In the center of the picture is the MAB or Module Assembly Building. Below the MAB, you can see Unit 2 and to the right is Unit 3, as well as the Heavy Lift Derrick.","We are making progress on low-profile cooling towers that you can see on the left side of this picture. I'll discuss the site in more detail shortly. But here, you can get a feel for the layout of the site, and you can see that things are really starting to take shape.","On Slide 20, you see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. As previously mentioned, during 2013, we completed the over 50-hour continuous pour of the nuclear island basemat, also referred to as first nuclear concrete. Then using the Heavy Lift Derrick, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the basemat, as well as the containment vessel bottom head on the CR-10 module. 2 of the 3 courses of concrete that will allow setting of the first ring section have been placed below the bottom head and around CR-10. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as the reactor vessel, piping, steam generators and the pressurizer. As you can see on the slide, work continues on the Unit 2 nuclear island with the walls taking shape, as well as components being placed in the auxiliary building and inside the containment vessel.","On Slide 21, along the top, you can see pictures showing the successful pouring of nuclear island basemat for Unit 3, which took place in November. This continuous pour took only 43 hours due to lessons learned on the Unit 2 pour. On the bottom left of the slide, you can see the finished product of that pour. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the nuclear island for Unit 3. Construction of the CR-10 module on the Unit 3 nuclear island basemat that you can see on the bottom right of the slide is now complete.","On the top left of Slide 22, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head. Similar to Unit 2, this bottom head will be placed on the nuclear island on top of the CR-10 module for Unit 3. On the top right of the same slide, you'll see some of the containment vessel rings. On the front left, you can see the beginnings of the first ring for Unit 3. Behind it, on the back left, you can see the second ring for Unit 2, which, as mentioned earlier, is scheduled to be on the hook in fourth quarter of 2014. On the back right, you can see the first ring for Unit 2.","On the bottom left, you can see cooling tower 2 Alpha and the Unit 2 circulating water pump house excavation. As mentioned during our last call, both cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are now structurally complete. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated. The circulating water system pump house is used to move water from the cooling towers back to the condenser in the plant.","On the bottom right, you'll see a picture from inside the new water treatment facility. This facility will provide the site with potable water and filtered water.","On Slide 23, you can see a schematic of the turbine building. It illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when completed. The modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in their final locations, with work continuing to progress for modules CH-82 and CH-81 Charlie.","On Slide 24, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide, you can see all of the previously mentioned modules placed on the turbine building basemat, as well as the progress being made on CH-82.","On Slide 25, you will see a few of the components that have arrived on-site. On the top left, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 reactor vessel. This vessel is a thick metal clad with stainless steel and houses the fuel assemblies. On the top right, you'll see the Unit 2 auxiliary transformer. This transformer provides power for the Unit 2 station loads. On the bottom left, you'll see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the Heavy Lift Derrick. The moisture separator reheater takes steam coming out of the high-pressure turbine and superheats the steam before it enters the low-pressure turbines to ensure that it's all steam and no water. On the bottom right, you'll see the Unit 2 diesel generators. These generators are non-safety-related components that provide backup power for Unit 2.","On Slide 26, you'll see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of the construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 and reflects our preliminary estimates that are expected to be updated and filed in the first quarter BLRA filing in mid-May.","As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and are associated with the right-hand axis. As we stated during our last call, the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.","Please now turn to Slide 27. We have 2 BLRA filings coming up in May. As mentioned earlier, in mid-May, we file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And on May 30, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. Both of these filings will be made available for review in the new nuclear development yellow box in the Investor Relations section at scana.com.","On Slide 28, you'll see a breakout of the total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our preliminary estimate of project costs as of the first quarter of 2014. Project costs are down approximately $623 million from the original approval received from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.","On Slide 29, you'll see a picture of Unit 1 at V.C. Summer station. On April 4, we took Unit 1 offline to begin a scheduled refueling outage. The outages occur at 18-month frequencies, and this is the 21st for V.C. Summer Unit 1, which began commercial operation in 1984. The refueling outage allows us to replace about 1\/3 of V.C. Summer's 157 fuel assemblies, perform preventive maintenance work and make preemptive inspections and repairs. During this outage, we performed a planned inspection of the reactor vessel head. The reactor vessel head contains a total of 66 penetrations, which are mostly used to maneuver control rods in the reactor. As a result of this inspection, we identified wells for a few of these penetrations that need repair. An extensive robotic inspection of the vessel showed that there was no leakage from these areas as a result of the condition of the wells. This kind of maintenance is common over the life of the nuclear plant, and the work can be done in parallel with other preplanned plant improvements, so that there will be a minimum impact to the outage.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Before we get into all the nuclear questions, maybe you could help me out with just some basic blocking- and tackling-type questions. It's really one question with 2 parts. So your '14 EPS guidance range was affirmed at the $3.45 to $3.65. But if I look at the trailing 12 months, you're at $3.65. Now I know you have BLRA revenues coming in, in '14. So how -- what keeps you within that stated range for '14? That's the first part of the question. The second part is, which I think is actually more important is, with your growth rate also being maintained at the 3% to 6%, and my numbers for '14 are obviously coming up, how should I think about comps going forward? So saying it differently, how will you -- or will you hit the 3% to 6% growth rate in 2015 off of a 2014 base, especially if that '14 base is above the original guidance range?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Jim. So the first part, I would say -- again, as I said in the earlier comments, our prepared comments, $0.10 of Q1 was weather from the electric business. So that's the first time in 3 years we've had a weather impact in the electric business because we had to pilot weather normalization. So does that $0.10 sustain itself through the end of the calendar\/fiscal year? Who knows? It was a cold first quarter, but frankly, it was about the same as Q1 of '13. It's just that we had the normalization in for the electric business in '13. So it took a quarter to generate that much excess weather in a very unusual winter. To give you an example, we had 17 days in March where the lows were in the 30s. Now I know I'm not going to get the sympathy from you in New York with those kind of temperatures, but that is very unusual in the southeast with that kind of weather. Whereas it took a quarter to generate that excess here, we could easily, if we had a mild July or August, all of that could erode. So it's a little early to start saying, \"is that going to put you over the top end?\" And as far the longer term, as you said, the more important question, we're still comfortable with that 3% to 6% for '14 based on the '13 base.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of UBS.","Michael Weinstein","Could you talk a little bit more about the nonregulated gas company and the $0.05 offset in each direction and how that was been affected by the polar vortex?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. So in that market, SCANA and the broader market, a majority of the customers now are on fixed rates. And of course, we -- financially, we don't speculate on that. So we financially hedge those customers for the term of their contract based on normal weather. So when we have colder-than-normal weather, we've got to either provide that additional gas, if you will, from a financial standpoint from the spot market or from storage. And there is only so much you can do out of storage when you have that extreme weather. So when we bought the additional gas to serve those customers, that eliminated a great deal of the benefit from the actual additional sales.","Michael Weinstein","What drove the additional sales? Was that...","Jimmy E. Addison","Weather, all weather.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Okay. So normally -- all right, if you didn't have...","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Sorry, I missed the first part of your question.","Michael Weinstein","So essentially, even though you're hedged or even though you got caught -- basically, I mean, like everybody else got caught short with fixed contracts in an extreme weather situation, it still wound up being a neutral effect.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. That's right, and we've had that situation before. And I would say, that's a -- I'm sure it could be slightly less, but I can't imagine it being a lot more extreme than that. So in -- on a real live, very extreme case, we're still on our plan for the year. So compared to 2013's first quarter, which was a normal weather quarter overall, where this one was abnormally cold, we ended up about the same point.","Michael Weinstein","Right. I guess, the thing that confuses me a little bit is that if -- more of a bad thing should be just bad, right? I mean, in other words, increased sales that are money-losing sales because they're unhedged should have just been negative.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, that's only part of our customer base, right? So we got -- and we, SCANA Energy, as well as the whole market has another segment of the customers that are variable-price customers, that are repriced each month, so...","Michael Weinstein","Oh, that explains it. Okay.","Jimmy E. Addison","Right, right.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. All right. Got you. So the variable is positive, fixed is negative?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Michael Weinstein","That's the story. Okay. And also, on the nuclear part, just to ask one question there. Just seeing that the overall CapEx level is down negative and, I guess, about $32 million less. And is the reason for that just lower financing costs going forward because of the delay?","Jimmy E. Addison","Right. So that's $32 million less just in those first 3 years that are presented. If you look down on the recap box at the -- in the top half, we just tie it to the 3-year 10-K disclosures. So at the bottom, though, you'll see the full project disclosure. And you'll see it's actually slightly a net increase over that period because some of those milestone payments we'll be making later and, therefore, they incur a little more escalation. So you're only catching part of the picture with those first 3 years.","Michael Weinstein","I see. And that's why escalation is about $10 million less or there's a -- yes, like -- $10 million less under budget than before, right?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering, during some of these extreme cold weather events you had, maybe in hours or days, if you saw certain stresses in your system, either on the gas or the power side and how that might play into your thoughts about investment going forward.","Stephen A. Byrne","Travis, this is Steve. We did see some stresses on our generating system. I think it was January 7, we had -- which was unusual for us, we set a 24-hour energy peak. Generally, we're a summer-peaking utility. But it got cold enough down here that we actually set a peak, an all-time peak for 24 hours in the wintertime. So January 7 was a stressor for us, a stressor for a couple reasons. One, we had a couple of generating plants that were out. Given the high loads, all of our neighbors were also stressed, so the power available on the open market wasn't there. And then, of course, there were operational flow orders that would limit the gas that you could take to power plants coming out of the Gulf. And so we had both gas and electric supply issues during some of that cold weather. The second cold weather events, we didn't have any problems.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. More of macro kind of on that idea, would north to south pipeline flows, in terms of the gas side, would that have done anything? Would that have alleviated any problems, i.e., is there -- do you guys see value in reversing, essentially, some of those flows?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. From our perspective, as long as I could lock down more supply on the pipeline, then it would likely help me. But there wasn't anything to be had on the pipeline, as in the capacity of the pipeline was maxed out. So we were limited to what we had reserved on frontal [ph] capacity during those time frames. So what I would need is, it's not just the supply; it's the capacity.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to check in on coal ash, and it's just been an issue that we think a lot about. Is there any movement in the state as you think about the potential treatment of storage facilities, et cetera? Is that something that's coming up?","Stephen A. Byrne","Well, what we've seen as a result of the Kingston Dam failure back in 2008 and then more recently, the Dan River failure, we have seen an increased interest in state regulators on any impoundments we would have, i.e. ash ponds. Now we -- because of facility retirements, we're down to only 2 locations that have ash ponds, and we have active plans to retire those. So for us, I think it's a pretty good news story. And we're actually ahead of schedule on emptying out some of the ash from those ponds. So where we can, we're sending it to beneficial reuse. So it's things like the cement industry, wallboard industry, those kinds of things. So while we've seen increased scrutiny, our plans have stood up to that test.","Stephen Byrd - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. Than just over on the solar side of things, I was just curious, the latest in terms of proposed solar legislation, how is that going? What's been the sort of range of reaction and what should we be looking for there?","Stephen A. Byrne","We have worked with other stakeholders in the state, including environmental groups and the other utilities to propose some legislation. We believe the legislation is a good way to enact solar that tries to learn some of the lessons from places, particularly on the West Coast, in Arizona, that have implemented without a good set of ground rules and have run into some problems. That legislation is not yet out of the legislature in South Carolina. If successful, we believe it will be a model for the industry. That said, we do have active plans to build solar. We're looking at a couple of utility-scale solar farms now, in addition to what we already have in our system, which is over 200 solar generators, the largest of which is on the roof of the Boeing facility down in Charleston.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","Jimmy, can you -- I was looking through -- I'm sorry, I don't have this. When you came up with guidance earlier than the first quarter, what growth rate did you assume as part of the midpoint?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, the growth for the $3.55?","Ashar Khan","That's correct.","Jimmy E. Addison","I think that off of actual '13, it was like 4.2%, something like that.","Ashar Khan","So you expect it...","Jimmy E. Addison","Low 4s.","Ashar Khan","Sorry?","Jimmy E. Addison","Low 4%, yes.","Ashar Khan","Low 4% growth rate in sales?","Jimmy E. Addison","Oh, I'm sorry. I was talking about earnings.","Ashar Khan","No, no. That's what I thought I was not hearing as well.","Jimmy E. Addison","No, and sales is actually slightly negative.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So you expected flat sales?","Jimmy E. Addison","Virtually. We actually had slightly negative that we disclosed on the year-end call. I think it's like 0.2% -- 0.2% to 0.5% negative. And obviously, we experienced the opposite in Q1, weather normalized sales back on that Chart #2 there. You'll see what...","Ashar Khan","Yes, that's what I'm trying to sort. So when you came up with guidance for '14, you had flat sales in the forecast?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, slightly negative.","Ashar Khan","Slightly negative. So then can you tell us based on 1% delta, if sales are higher by 1%, what that helps -- how does that help electric margin?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think, Ashar, I'm going from memory here. I don't have this in front of me. But I think like a 1% change in that is $0.02 to $0.03 per share.","Ashar Khan","$0.02 to $0.03 per share. So we have now like $0.04 -- 4%. So if this continues for the whole year, then it would be like a $0.12 positive delta? Is that fair?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's fair. That's a big if, though. We've got 2 consecutive quarters now of overall positive weather normalized usage, but we had 3 before that were negative. So I'm very optimistic at this point, but I'm not really ready to call it a trend yet.","Ashar Khan","Okay, okay, okay.","Jimmy E. Addison","I am encouraged -- when you pair that with the unemployment rates that we've presented earlier, I'm encouraged by it.","Ashar Khan","Right. I mean, that's what I'm trying to think through, whether -- what's kind of happening. You have some soft quarters and then things turn around, and they become really kind of positive and things like that, whether this is sustainable or not sustainable.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, and it's still an open question. But I would say, the last 3 years, we've spent a lot of time talking about economic announcements, and most of those announcements now have translated into payroll. And there's folks out working, everything from the anchor being Boeing, to the tire expansions, to Nephron Pharmaceuticals just down the street from us here opening. So a lot of these things are translating into jobs, which are translating into consumer confidence, and I think we're seeing that in our numbers.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","My first question is about the nuclear construction. On Page 13, you removed the expression, \"We are confident in this range.\" So I'm just wondering if you could elaborate a bit more on sort of a maybe less commitment to the time schedule? And you mentioned that you'll have an updated schedule in the third quarter. What exactly is it that we're waiting for? And can you get any more specific as to what is going to happen in the third quarter?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, Andrew, what we're waiting for from the consortium, which is Chicago Bridge & Iron and Westinghouse, is based on the experience that they've had to date, factoring in the engineering schedule, the procurement schedule, their actual construction experience, worker efficiency, those kind of things, we want a new integrated project schedule. And then we hope that they will mitigate that to the extent that they can. And sometimes, what we put out is about the third quarter, we ought to have that from the consortium and have had time to look at it. And that really, from our perspective, will start the clock on our negotiations with them about what is a reasonable schedule and what's not a reasonable schedule. So while we remain confident in the plus-18 months that our Public Service Commission gives us from a contingency perspective, I don't know exactly today, until I get the information, the feedback back from the consortium, what it is that they're looking at.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. Now is that -- would you consider that more fine-tuning or is it more sort of taking a fresh set of eyes and maybe starting from scratch? Not starting from scratch, but starting -- could there be major revisions, I guess?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, I think it's both. I think that the Chicago Bridge & Iron team coming in was new taking over from Shaw. The folks that hung over from Shaw have now been replaced with CB&I folks. So our entire team at the site is new, and the entire leadership team up through CB&I is new to us. So we've got a new team in. There's been some turnover in the Westinghouse folks as well. So I would consider some of it refinements and some of it actual experiences as they receive submodules in, for example, and they have to get to welding them on the site, doing installation as they've done concrete pours, those kinds of things. They're learning a lot. And so some of the things that they plan on when they originally quote a project is worker efficiency. Now while I don't know what that worker efficiency was that they quoted us upfront, they've obviously got some time under their belts now to figure out whether that's realistic or unrealistic. And they've also had some time to look at their supply chain. And where components have shown up on time, they'll factor that in. If they've been late, they'll factor that in. And so what I expect to get from them is just a new estimate of completion. And by estimate, I mean, a schedule. But again, I still expect it to come within our contingency, but I don't know exactly where it's going to be. And I'm certain they'll come back and say, \"But I might be able to improve that if you gave me just a little bit more.\" So that's what I mean when we say we'll start the discussion or the negotiation point, at that point when I get that schedule from them.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay. And then as far as communicating that progress with us, is that something -- when you say third quarter, would that be like the next quarterly earnings call?","Stephen A. Byrne","The next quarterly earnings call will be a little early for that. It will probably be the call after that.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. Then the only other question I have on the more near-term stuff is, can remind us the plan for O&Ms for this year and maybe how you might adjust that in response to the strong start to the year?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, so the plan was generally around about a 3% increase in O&M. I think Q1, we're about 2%, so we're close to that plan. And some of the weather impact in Q1 caused us to delay some of our planned O&M spend. So there's some things that we were able to defer for a short period of time. In fact, with the kind of shoulder month weather we're having now, a lot of that is going on from plant maintenance to out on the T&D system. So I don't see a great deal of change in the O&M plan for the year at this point.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a mix of questions, Jimmy, for both you and Steve. One, a financing question. You've reduced, per Page 10, your new nuclear CapEx for the year, for 2014. But you didn't revise your financing data for 2014. Just curious, why not kind of move the financing along with kind of the timing of some of the new nuclear?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, a very fair question. And the answer really goes back to the one that Steve just answered about this Q3 re-baseline. I've said all along, there's no urgency to -- particularly on the equity side. The earliest we needed it was late this year. So if anything, this takes a little pressure off of that. But really, I would like to get more information on the whole re-baseline and that whole discussion with the consortium before we make any final decisions on that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And Steve, any insights at all -- I mean, the Chinese AP1000 project, Sanmen and Haiyang, are a couple of years ahead of both Vogtle and V.C. Summer in terms of the construction process. Just any insights or read across about whether those facilities in China look like they're going to come on time -- come online on time, on budget? Or whether there's any deviation of the project schedules for either of those 2?","Stephen A. Byrne","With respect to the budget, I don't think I have any clue. I don't know that they disclose budget information for the Chinese projects the same way that we do, so I just don't know. With respect to the schedule, they've been 2, 2.5 years ahead of us. I expect that to hold. So that would say that they are probably similarly delayed to us.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And any -- one last one. And Jimmy, this is probably for you. In the regulatory items or regulatory highlights you mentioned down at the bottom of Page 8, the gas RSA filing, just curious given the earned returns in the gas business so far for the rolling 12 months, do you expect to file for gas base rate increases in either jurisdiction?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, not in this timeframe. And frankly, the way the mechanism works in South Carolina, if anything, there's a potential for a small decrease, but not material from a financial standpoint. But I think it's just reflective of the cost control we've had across the whole business has benefited the gas business too, along with the growth. I mean, the customer growth keeps coming with this -- with the build in the economy, while we've controlled costs along the way.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And finally, we've seen your neighbor, Duke, talk about a need for incremental pipeline capacity into North Carolina. And just curious whether it's CGTC or at the holding company level, whether an opportunity exists for SCANA to either be an investor on a project like that or in a separate type of project? Whether there's even a need for incremental new gas pipeline to flow into your service territory?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, we've had an open season through our interstate company here very recently, and there's a lot of interest. But the way that works is, you go through that and mainly industrials express their preliminary interest. And then you've got to go through a sorting out process where you find out what's really a binding indication. And we're kind of in the middle of that now. We've not gotten to the binding part. So we'll have to see what comes out of that. I can tell you generally, the pipelines are full because of the price of gas being driven down by the shale gas. And there are a lot of industrial processes that would like to switch from other fuels to natural gas. And we got to sort out who's really serious about it now as opposed to who answered the first call. Having said that, I don't -- you're not going to see it be material to SCANA's overall earnings.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, you don't view it as -- there's not a significant rate base opportunity for SCANA on the interstate pipeline side?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right, not to the SCANA level. And that will be significant to that subsidiary, but you're talking about a company with less than $200 million of rate base. So...","Operator","Our next question will come from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just really quick. Just a clarification on one of the questions, I think, Ashar was at. With the 1% -- sorry, the sales growth forecast, what are you guys forecasting now? I'm sorry to -- I didn't get it completely. What is your new sales -- retail sales forecast?","Jimmy E. Addison","Okay. Let me try this one more time. Pardon for not being clear earlier. We have not changed our forecast. We've got a strong quarter to report here in Q1, but our forecast is for about 0.5% decline in 2014 compared to 2013 actual. Obviously, completely different direction here in Q1. Maybe at some point during the year that translates to a different forecast, but we're just not at that point yet, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then when we look at these rather strong numbers on a weather-adjusted basis, given the bag of the weather was so abnormal this quarter, does that give you any -- does that give you a little less confidence maybe in what these -- with the weather-adjustment calculation that you're doing? Or just -- does it give you any -- I mean, I know sometimes this is more of an art than a science. I'm just wondering, is that -- because the numbers do seem pretty high, just period. I mean, was there something else going on? I mean, 4%...","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think that's a very fair question as well. So the thing that -- what I would say is, on a positive standpoint, we've had a couple of quarters in a row like this now. And Q4 was nowhere near as extreme as this was. I think it was fairly normal, the best I recall, from a weather standpoint. But to your question about, is carving out the weather effect an exact science, it absolutely is not. You got to make 2 major assumptions in that. And one is, how much of the customer load by class is non-weather sensitive and how much is weather sensitive? And then for the weather-sensitive part, how much is impacted by the extreme weather that was actually realized? So absolutely, it's modeled on an assumption basis. Is it precise? It's the best model we have. It's one that the industry obviously is challenged with when it's extremes like this. And that's another reason that I just don't get committed to trends based on 1 or 2 quarters.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. when do you think that you guys might take another look at sort of your annual forecast, I mean, for guidance purposes?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, for sure, each quarter. But in our business, Q3 is the big quarter. So Q2 is only about 15% of our annual operating plan from an earnings standpoint. So it's highly unlikely that we're going to come along at the end of Q2 and reassess our guidance at that point because so much of it is driven in the third quarter, just because of the cyclical nature, the heat in south.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will be a follow-up from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I wanted to follow-up on one of Michael Lapides' questions and just go off a little bit tangentially there. How are your coal stockpiles doing right now? And are you having any trouble with rail and transport getting any coal?","Stephen A. Byrne","Well, because we have shuttered a number of coal facilities, our situation is pretty good with the coal stockpiles. Now we're coming off a period where we had relatively high coal stockpiles, so perhaps not a big surprise. There have been some issues with delivery, particularly from rail, and we have the luxury of having port delivery available to us. And so we are looking into the possibility of receiving some shipments in through the Port of Charleston, and those go basically right to our Williams Station, so -- which is our largest single unit. So we will be offsetting some of what we may not be able to get via rail by ship receipts.","Operator","The next question will come from Neil Kalton of Wells Fargo Securities.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. You are off to a good start this year obviously with some things, maybe unusual, but with the weather-adjusted sales, if that sustains itself, you guys look like you're on target to do better than what you originally thought. So my question is, we see a lot of other companies, when this occurs, pull forward O&M expense and sort of use the cash in that sense. Would that be your intention possibly or would maybe a better path to sort of use the excess cash to invest in your infrastructure needs and reduce the equity that you need with the nuclear generation? So how do you think about that, I guess?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Neil, I don't see a lot of variation in our O&M plan. We've been very disciplined about our O&M that's core to customer service and reliability. And for example, in the toughest times of the recession, we've maintained our vegetation management, trimming the trees. It helps us really keep good outage records with the customers. So we're not behind. So there's not a lot of bounce back or anything like that we need to do. Having said that, there's always some judgmental things that you can move around a little bit on timing of when you deal with them. But I don't see a huge variation in that. And of course, we've got plenty of capital need as you referenced there on our expansion with the new nuclear. And I would see us probably use it more for -- just to defray the needs for debt and equity as soon. I would just see it just kind of moving those things to the right maybe slightly. But honestly, Neil, I've been waiting 6 years to start having calls like these the last couple of quarters. We really see some confidence in the economy. It's been a tough run and I'm really encouraged by the economy. When you start looking at those unemployment rates back on that Slide 5, and you see that proxy that we build for our electric operating territory at just over 4.5%, I mean, you're getting down to functionally full employment there, and that's pretty exciting. It happens to be that the county -- our headquarters that's based in here has the lowest unemployment in the state, and we're excited about where we're headed.","Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It looks like very good news and hopefully, it sustains throughout the course of the year.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I agree. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan","I think it's been kind of answered. My question was regarding the nuclear CapEx delays and the impact on equity. It's been answered.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thank you, Ashar.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Weinstein of UBS.","Michael Weinstein","I just wanted to go back to Steven's question and just make sure that you guys are still -- that you are indeed confident you're still within the 18-month window. I think that was the thrust of his question. I heard you say confident. I just wanted to reiterate that though.","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, we may have changed a word on the slide. I'm not sure about that. My review...","Michael Weinstein","But that wasn't intentional, right?","Stephen A. Byrne","Detail about that slide. But we -- based on our discussions with the consortium, we're still confident at this point in time in the staying within the PSC-allowed contingency, which is plus-18 months.","Michael Weinstein","But when you look at the Slide 13, and you see the green box that you guys put in there, that's unchanged from before. So you're -- I mean, since you are awaiting a baseline, would it be fair to say that, that green box no longer really applies anymore, that you're simply somewhere in that 18-month window at this point?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes. Until I see something from the consortium that tells me I'm going to be outside of the box, remember that box was a band that was built around -- I think it was Q4 of '17 to Q1 of '18. And the consortium had been working to a schedule which was December of '17. So it's entirely possible that we could end up still within that green box. So until I find out that I'm not, I'm going to leave it where it is.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Stephen A. Byrne","Dan, no sympathy from you either about the weather, right?","Dan Jenkins","No, no. So when we look at the projects on the nuclear plant that you have laid out on page -- Slide 18, are any of those contingent on the other items? So for example, does CA-01 have to happen before CA-03, or are they all kind of on parallel tracks?","Stephen A. Byrne","They're all being constructed on parallel track. But you are correct that CA-03 cannot be set until CA-01 is set. And then we need CA-01 in before I can get containment vessel Ring 2 in. And that really is a height limitation on even the world's largest Heavy Lift Derrick. I can't get over 2 ring sections, plus this very big module at the same time. So yes, you're correct that the CA-03 and the containment vessel Ring 2 are follow-ons to CA-01. So that's a very important one for us.","Operator","Our next question will be from David Paz of Wolfe Research.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","I just had a question. Your current guidance and growth rate, does that assume that bonus D&A is not extended beyond '13?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's correct. It assumes -- it's based on current law.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Okay. Do you happen to know about how your growth rate would be impacted if it were extended, say, another year or 2?","Jimmy E. Addison","David, I don't see it materially impacting our growth rate. I mean, it's in the ballpark of $50 million to $75 million a year in cash. But I just don't see that material enough to impact growth rates of any significance. Again, that's kind of like the cash from the weather, right -- or, no, the cash from the economic growth. I mean, to me, it just allows you to push a little bit to the right on the planned debt and equity insurances.","David A. Paz - Wolfe Research, LLC","Got it. And your nuclear construction units aren't considered in service until they come online. I guess, just -- we'll keep thinking about them from a bonus depreciation law, if that were to be extended through your construction period, just how would that impact your ultimate rate base?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, no real impact on the nuclear side because you're exactly right, no depreciation there until they come online.","Operator","Our next question will be a follow-up from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up. This is the first earnings call after the ORS put out their April 1 piece on the project. And one of the things that kind of stands out is, some of their commentary about milestones. And they had the section that kind of talked about how, of the 51 remaining milestones, that like 88% of them have been delayed to some point, and that they've even had to notify the commission of some that have been delayed more than 10 months. Can you just talk a little bit about, a, are these milestones that can get things back on track? Or b, is this just all tied and all part of the bigger, hey, look, we've had some initial delays, albeit kind of minor measured in months or even just a quarter or 2, and that this will all get kind of wrapped up and resolved when you get the integrated project schedule in the next 6 or 9 months?","Stephen A. Byrne","I think the answer is that, when we originally laid out our case to build these plants, so you're going back to hearings we had in 2008, we were required to submit at that point in time a milestone schedule. That milestone schedule had in it a number of things that were fairly imprecise at that point in time. So we're talking about a project that was going to be built over 10 years, and we had to supply a milestone schedule that had 146, as I recall, milestones. I think 60% of which or more are completed now. So it was not unusual that some of those milestones would move around. Now what we're seeing in the milestones of the Office of Regulatory Staff is concerned with is that they put out a -- I guess it's a self-imposed 10 months where they would notify the Public Service Commission of anything over that 10 months. So there are a number of them that are over 10 months. What we're concerned with is the plus-18 months, because we are considered within our schedule as long as we're within 18 months. Now there are a couple that are challenging the 18 months. One of them, I think, is that CA-03 set. So -- and a lot of things are dependent on how things go with the modules. So we continue to come back to -- even some of these milestone issues are a function of what goes on with the modules. So as long as the consortium hits their module dates, I think we should be within the 18-month contingency on all of them. That being said, there are still some challenges that we have outlined in our BLRA quarterly reports. And a couple of those are things like, reactor cooling pumps, squib valves. And while there are plans that are currently being worked to recover those schedules, we need to see them come to fruition before we would say that we're good on those yet. So there are some things that may challenge the 18 months, but I don't think any of the ones that are challenging that 18 months are really going to be impacting on the in-service dates for the units.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And big-picture question, I hadn't really asked this. What happens if the 18 month slips? Meaning, what -- from a regulatory perspective, if the 18 -- if you go beyond the 18-month timeline, what's the process from there?","Stephen A. Byrne","Well, we would file for basically a schedule re-baseline with the Public Service Commission, which would be a full hearing process. And we would outlay what the reason is for delay. Intervenors would have an opportunity to challenge us. And we would go before the commission to say that we want to schedule re-baseline if we go over any of those milestones.","Jimmy E. Addison","And Michael, we've done that twice before, not because of exceeding the 18 months, but because of the original contingency being removed by the Supreme Court decision. We went through that process twice already for cost items that would have gone against the contingency. And the commission has endorsed those. And each time they did that, they changed the schedule for the latest information at that time. So it would be the same process again.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And as I understand that process, when the courts may go and take contingency out of the initial project, approved project budget, that it wasn't really what you'd call a contentious process. I mean, the commission kind of looked at it and said, \"Understood,\" and kind of things change around a little bit and kind of, \"Let's go from there.\"","Stephen A. Byrne","Remember, when the original Base Load Review Act was approved, it was February of 2009, it had entered a contingency fund. And what was challenged to the Supreme Court was not that we would never have to use contingency. What they didn't like was the fact that it was preapproved enough to us as to where we spend it. And there point was, we ought to be held accountable for the contingency and have to come back and ask for more when we run into contingency items. And that's really what the Supreme Court said. And so as -- we've done that now twice and the Public Service Commission has approved those each time.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And can you refresh, what was that contingency amount originally? So if they were -- if CBI comes back in their delays or you're beyond the 18 months, or just, I don't know, stuff happens. It's a big project. I'm just trying to think about how -- if I were a commissioner, I approved the project at x. But because of a court decision, it's really x minus something. And then if you come back say, \"Hey, look, I kind of need some of that minus,\" it's still not that much above what I had originally thought of as the project cost.","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, the original contingency number I believe was $438 million. Now remember, that's our -- that was for our 55% share.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, thank you. And to summarize, we're off to a good start in 2014. The weather comes and goes, but I'm particularly encouraged by the economic indicators, especially unemployment rates and the apparent consumer confidence. We remain on track to meet our internal earnings targets and our new nuclear construction continues to progress.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2016. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update of our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our Web site at scana.com.

The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investor Relations section of our Web site under Webcasts & Presentations. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. GAAP earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $23 per share compared to $2.80 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding the net of tax gain on the sales of CGT and SCI positive earning drives us from electric margin, margin primarily due to base load review accurate increase and customer growth as well as the positive impact of the depreciation study will more than offset by the negative impact of weather on both electric margins as well as on gas margins in our Georgia business.","Gas margins were also banned due to CGT operating for a month during the first quarter of 2015 before it was sold. Additionally, expected increases in O&M expenses in CapEx related items including interest in property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. The bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2016 and increase to electric margins by $0.05 per share in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in a $0.10 per share in a negative swing.","Slide 4 shows earnings on a GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized basis earnings in the first quarter of 2016 were $28 per share compared to the $34 per share in the same quarter of 2015. As a reminder GAAP-Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS excludes the impact of abnormal weather on electric margins and the native tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI for the first quarter of 2015. Abnormal weather on gas margins is not adjusted in this measure as gas margins weather normalized for the north and south Carolina gas business and the direct impact of abnormal weather on Georgia business is generally in significant on an annual basis.","Now on Slide 5, I would like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. On a GAAP basis South Carolina Electric & Gas Company first quarter 2016 earnings were down $0.08 per share compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in earnings is due to lower electric margins principally is a result of abnormal weather in both periods, as well as higher O&M expenses and hard expenses related to our capital program included interest expense and property taxes.","These decreases more than offset increases from the continued recovery of financing cost under the BLRA, customer growth in both the electric and gas business and the application of the previously mentioned new depreciation rates. PSNC Energy reported earnings of $0.25 per share in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.24 per share in the same quarter of the prior year, primarily due to higher margins from customer growth.","SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA energy marketing and SCANA energy in Georgia set a decrease in first quarter earnings in $0.06 per share primarily due to lower through put attributable to abnormal weather during the first quarter of 2016 as compared to 2016 and higher transportation cost.","On a GAAP basis, SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported relatively flat earnings in the first quarter of 2016 compared to $44 per share in the comparative quarter of the prior year. Excluding the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $41 per share, GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS was down $0.03 due primarily to foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. The Carolinas continue to be seen as a favorable business environment, and we're pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories as evidence and milestone to invest approximately 380 million with the expectation of creating approximately 1300 jobs.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate, along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence, and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.7%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5%. Our particular interest and testing to our stage strong economic growth almost 80,000 for 3.7% more South Carolina\u2019s are working today than a year ago.","Slide 7 presents costumer growth in electric statistics. On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated business. SCE&G is electric business add a customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.5%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.5% and 2.7%, respectively. We continue to see very strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12-months ended December 31, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 1.3% on a 12-month ended basis.","Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulator rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.5 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity.","The earned return for the 12-months ended December 31, 2016 in the base electric business is approximately 9.75%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our LDCs in South and North Carolina and if they earned ROV of the gas business for the twelve months ending March 31 falls outside the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we will file to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act in June. As of December 31, 2015 the 12 month earned return for SCE&G gas was 0.65%.","Year-over-year we have recently filed an application with the North Carolina Utilities Commission requesting an annual revenue increase of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned return in that business. This rate increase as a results of PSNC\u2019s need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to include pipeline in integrity management rider. This rider would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of New Nuclear spending through 2018, and is consistent with last quarter's call and the February quarterly BLRA report, which also reflects the amended EPC agreement that was announced in October 2015. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated New Nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30, to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.","Slide 10 presents the transition payments information and an expected timeframe for our filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. Once these events are complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan.","Now please turn to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and DRIP plans, at least until we have fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. The election of the fixed price option would likely change planned equity issuances after 2016. It is unlikely these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continued to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50\/50 debt and the equity basis.","On Slide 12, we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized earnings guidance is $3.90 per share to $4.10 per share, with an internal target of $4 per share. Our long-term GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over three to five years using a base of 2015 GAAP Adjusted Weather Normalized EPS of $3.73.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I would like to begin by addressing the status of the settlement with the Consortium and PSC approved process. Slide 13 presents the settlement agreement outline that we have previously shown, Westinghouse closed on the transaction to acquire Stone & Webster from CB&I at the end of December, and Fluor began work as a subcontracted construction manager for the New Nuclear construction-site on January 4. The craft employees transaction to Fluor on April 4.","On slide 13 presents cost as of the settlement date and our next quarterly BLRA update filing to be filed in the next couple of weeks, we plan to update the project cost for estimated change orders primarily related to items listed in Exhibit C of the settlement agreement. As in their recall Exhibit C described items net results and net settlement.","On slide 14, several of those items for which we now have estimated the cost. Also listed of the estimated change orders associate with escalating the software and documentation necessarily to complete the project and new change orders initiated since the settlement that are owner a directed. Additional sales tax which has been excluded from the fixed price option is also listed.","Slide15 presents the relative schedules of both filing of update attrition and the annual request for revised rates. We continue our analysis of the fixed price option and we will consider any input receive from Fluor. As a reminder, we have until November 1 of this year to unilaterally elect the fixed price option.","Regardless of which scenario we choose, once a decision has been made, we will file a petition with the Public Service Commission to amend the capital cost and schedule for the project. We continue to expect to reach a conclusion on the matter sometime during the second quarter and expect to have a minor delay of a few weeks in filing our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in order to coordinate the petition with the revised rates application.","Moving on to some of the activities at the New Nuclear construction-site, Fluor\u2019s integration into the project as Westinghouse's subcontracted construction manager continues to progress with the placement of managers in key positions of the construction areas and a series of the sessions for the taking place to streamline processes and improved performance.","Slide 16 present an aerial photo of the site from September of 2015. This photo gives you the view of the layout of the site and labeled both Units 2 & 3, as well as many other areas of the construction site.","Slide 17, presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. This expanded view gives you a better feel for how CA01 through CA05 fit spatially inside the containment vessel. As you will recall we have now placed CA01, CA04 and CA05 for Unit-2 and CA04 for Unit-3.","Slide 18 shows an aerial view of the Unit-2 containment. Looking down into the containment vessel you see the first ring section with openings of penetrations sitting on top of the lower bowl. As previously mentioned, CA01, CA04, and CA05 have been placed and conditioning in the picture.","Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit-2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. As mentioned in previous quarters CA02 is now structurally complete and awaiting installation.","Slide 20 shows a picture of the Unit-2 CA03, which is the west wall of the unit containment refueling water storage tank. Fabrication continues as all 17 of CA03 sub-modules are on-site and standing on the summary platform.","Slide 21 shows a picture of the first portion of the Unit-3 module CA20 which was placed during March. This module consist of four sub-assemblies and the decision was made to expedite placement of sub-assemblies three and four as they are allowed for to work to move forward that is required in order to begin shield building erection which is the next critical path item.","As you can see on slide 22, fabrication continues on sub-assemblies one and two inside of the module assembly building or MAB. All 72 require sub-modules are on-site, these remaining sub-assemblies will placed once they get completed. As a reminder CA20 has an auxiliary building module that which is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel.","Slide 23, shows a picture of the Unit-3 containment vessel Ring-1 placement and one is placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl on April 13.","Slide 24 shows a picture of the Unit-3 module CA05 which module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. Fabrication of the Unit-3 CA05 has been completed and has been stretched outside of the MAB.","Slide 25 shows a picture of the beginnings of the Unit-3 module CA01. Module CA01 houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, we have 24 of the 47 sub-modules on-site, seven of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together in the MAB.","Now we will turn the slide number 26, I want to briefly mention that last week in public service commission of South Carolina approved SC&Gs request to release its electric rated to reflect lower fuel cost. Heading at balance and diversified few mix contributes to lower fuel cost that we passed on to our customers. It is anticipated that this decrease should more than offset and in increase to residential customers from the BLRA for the year.","Finally please now turn the slide number 27, discuss some of the SC&Gs solar initiatives. Under South Carolina Law or Act 236 we are allow to recover certain cost associated with our efforts to implement the renewable energy incentive programs. We officially rolled out our DEO program and all this of 2015 with goal of adding approximately 84 megawatts of our new module generating facilities to our system by the end of 2020. We anticipate minimum a half way to our 2020 goal by the end of 2016.","That concludes our prepared remarks and I\u2019ll be glad to respond any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Jim von Riesemann at Mizuho Securities.","Jim von Riesemann","Hi, Jimmy. Hello? Jimmy? Jimmy? Hello.","Jimmy Addison","Hi is that better?","Jim von Riesemann","That's a lot better. I can hear everybody now. Let me just ask the elephant in the question room. There's been a lot of these conflicting signals in the marketplace about Toshiba and investors are obviously expressing some concern here. So with that being said, how does the fluidity of their situation affect your calculus with potentially accepting the fixed price option?","Jimmy Addison","Well we are certainly monitoring situation to the extent that we can get public information about it. I think the things that are important for our consideration are unlike the previous contract where we had certain calendar based payments in the newer range we are only paying for work completed. So we should be in a good a total of cash flow situation comparative to the work completed and not the behind or ahead on the cash payment at any point in time from here though with the completion.","So it\u2019s really progress payments are in line with the work they just completed. We also very focused on next six months, we have six more months where we have to make that decision and while we likely follow before them, we don\u2019t have make the technical election with Toshiba until that point. So we plan monitor the situation off-course they have taken some actions already on disclosing some of the noncore assets. They said that this business is core to them and they have back end up the decisions I made at this point so, it\u2019s obviously done in a general we\u2019re going to continue to monitor it over the next several months.","Jim von Riesemann","It's safe to say that you're not worried, though, is that what I'm hearing you saying?","Jimmy Addison","I mean no, it\u2019s certainly something we are monitoring it, we\u2019re paying attention to it, - but it\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a worry no?","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And did I hear Steve correctly, so you're going to delay the BLRA filing maybe until mid-June and at that time you'll give us either a strong signal, or you will have decided which option you're going to choose, is that correct?","Steve Byrne","Yes John we think we\u2019ve made our decision as we said before in the second quarter, we anticipate the filling for both in the second quarter, we just want to make sure that we a line one filling with the other, there is slightly different time frames, the update petition has by lower six-months before decision has to be lender by the public service commission, the annul be our right filing is a five-month time frame so we don\u2019t want, we would like not to be aligned with each other.","Jim von Riesemann","I get it. Okay. And then finally, on the equity question, how should we think about incremental equity, is that really one half the difference between, say, the amended EPC price and the fixed price option if you go that way?","Jimmy Addison","You know our strategy hasn\u2019t changed and that\u2019s correct we expect the finance roughly half and half with debt and equity between the two. What we don\u2019t know at this point is when we\u2019ll need it if we go that direction, it\u2019s got a way to sort out the progress payment schedule.","Jim von Riesemann","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Weinstein of UBS.","Michael Weinstein","Hi guys.","Jimmy Addison","Good afternoon.","Michael Weinstein","Hi. With trailing 12-months weather adjusted retail kilowatt hour sales at about 1.3% now, for the last six-months, can you just remind us again, what is the guidance for 2016, and at what point would you consider increasing it because of this?","Jimmy Addison","Well the guidance as it relates to sales growth. So, our overall plan was for slightly negative like just slightly below flat for the year compared to 2015 on a weather normal basis. So we\u2019re not at the points, we\u2019re too concerned about that yet as far as its impact on EPS, we had a very mild first quarter obviously $00.10 in the electric business quarter-over-quarter so we\u2019re not at any position here to consider revising that at this point.","Michael Weinstein","And when you guys report or when you guys guide to $3.90 to $4.10, that's weather normalized guidance for the entire year, not just from this point forward, right?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. So you intend to report whether you've achieved that guidance weather normalized at the end of the year, despite mild weather.","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s correct and the reason we\u2019re not making change at this point is we are only three-months into the year, so we've got substantially amount in front of us now, you know if we get three quarters through the year and we are in that situation and it might be a different discussion.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And one last question. On slide 14, the additional costs since the settlement agreement. So this would be in addition to the $288 million additional cost, right? This would be $56 million above that, and $66 million above the fixed price option incremental, right?","Jimmy Addison","Yes Mike that essentially correct from we signed our deal with Westinghouse in October, we had attached an Exhibit we call Exhibit C that had some things that we\u2019re working on that would be hadn\u2019t yet resolved and we\u2019re not resolved with this agreement so a bulk of what we see here is IMs that we've now resolved from that agreement or that Exhibit.","Michael Weinstein","And I know there's been some confusion out there over the performance bond that you have with Westinghouse. I'll just give you an opportunity now to explain it to everybody in case you still are getting phone calls on it.","Jimmy Addison","Yes I don\u2019t know we've had much of an enquiry about the thing, but we\u2019ve got the provisions out there basically to protect us on a in the short-terms it\u2019s relates to working capital. If they were to the default and had not paid a sub or something like that and we had to pick that work up through someone else, pay the sub that kind of thing, the formula is to help in the transition just based on quarterly projected payment for the year.","Michael Weinstein","Right. So it's basically a bond that's intended to finance a transition, more or less.","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right.","Michael Weinstein","In case you need it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Byrd, Morgan Stanley.","Stephen Byrd","Hi good afternoon.","Jimmy Addison","Good afternoon Steven.","Stephen Byrd","Just wanted to check in with you all on the status of the Sandman project in China, just your latest thinking in terms of how that's progressing.","Jimmy Addison","Steven we think that that\u2019s progressing fairly according to their latest finance plans, we anticipate that they are getting close to doing the cool hydro so there we have to - cooling pumps have been installed which was the last thing that they are waiting for Sandman at Unit-1. Their plan calls for them to load fuel yet this year so sometime probably in the lat - early fourth quarter and then testing from that point is really up to the utility. So it\u2019s less in Westinghouse hands than it is the utility\u2019s hands, but certainly sometime we think early next year I\u2019m not sure of going commercially is the appropriate term from China, but that will be on grade making power.","Stephen Byrd","Great. That's all I had. Thank you, very much.","Operator","The next question is from Feliks Kerman at Visium Asset Management.","Feliks Kerman","Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been asked. But if the you guys can talk a little bit about the pipeline integrity program you guys have asked for, what is the size, the scope? How long do you expect that program to last for?","Jimmy Addison","Yes so it's in our capital that we disclosed there for the three-years, there is a good bit of integrity management related in that entire CapEx period over the next three-years and I suspect it could be some beyond that too, but roughly about 50% of that CapEx is related to integrity management in 2016 from 2018. Some of that would be picked up with the midyear CWIP in the rate base so we will get half of the year when we actually have the discussions with North Carolina Commission staff in the middle of year. So we will basically have the remaining half of 2016 and 2017 and 2018. But roughly half of it relates to integrity management.","Feliks Kerman","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Jimmy Addison","You are welcome.","Operator","The next question is from Travis Miller at Morningstar.","Travis Miller","Hi, thank you. You answered most of my clarifying questions on the nuclear stuff, BLRA, et cetera. Wondering on the gas side, obviously, you had really strong customer growth, was wondering what that was doing to gas usage and also then the next step to gas margins at those businesses.","Jimmy Addison","Yes well Travis, two LDCs at - they really get handle through mechanisms in different ways, so in North Carolina there is the decoupler that handles unit change in consumption and weather et cetera. And then it doesn\u2019t have a rate base for just what we have rate case that we filed there now. In South Carolina we have the rate stabilization Act which is basically a streamlined rate review that happens after every heating season at the end of March and if there is more than 50 basis points variance and its adjusted in November. So it's really a consider through both of those mechanism even though they differ a little in their process.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then that customer growth, we see that kind of 2.5% type rate, does that mean substantial investment opportunity, either distribution or other value chain parts, over the next couple of years in addition to what you've already planned?","Jimmy Addison","Yes well I would say - not I wouldn\u2019t say a lot more than what we've planned, so what we've got in the plan now contemplates it. so in North Carolina and South Carolina they are differ somewhat. In South Carolina we own very little of the transmission system of course we used to own more of it through a different subsidiary, but we sold that a year ago. There is still some transmission in the South Carolina Electricity & Gas, gas system, but it's not a tremendous amount.","But it\u2019s certainly distribution growth there in the South Carolina system, but that\u2019s not a significant amount above and beyond the depreciation that applies to that business each year. In North Carolina it\u2019s a different story, but also significant transmission enhancements that are going on, actually bids that go into those projects a couple of weeks ago and it\u2019s a significant pipeline investment that\u2019s going on, and its going extremely well, the majority of its own existing right away in West and North Carolina.","Travis Miller","Okay and that could be the distribution investment options.","Jimmy Addison","Yes I mean the majority of this is related to growth in the territory, the areas we serve are going very well. A lot transmission enhancement in the next couple of years will be up in research triangle area too in additional to West or North Carolina, because a lot of the industrials are really going for example research universities all are going to complete gas supply as appose to other fuels. So I don\u2019t know there is tremendous new frontier kind of distribution opportunities, but I think there is a lot of industrials are really pushing it. Gas fired or electric generation too.","Travis Miller","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Jimmy Addison","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","Good afternoon.","Jimmy Addison","Hi Dan.","Dan Jenkins","I was wondering if you could give a little color on the, you had the $0.04 year-over-year for O&M, and I was wondering, what's driving that? Is that timing, or is that something that's going to continue on a comparison basis going forward?","Jimmy Addison","No it's fairly consistent with our internal budget it is a little more lumpy there in the first quarter, we don\u2019t expect to benefit that significant throughout years. The most significant thing is we've made compensation adjustments in the middle of the first quarter, so you have got some of that coming through and also the incentive base compensation the part is driven by - that\u2019s driven of share price has obviously been more than we had expected and I guess that a high class problem to have with the stock performing pretty well especially in superior group over the last quarter.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then, I think you mentioned on the nuclear, that the current critical path item is the shield building, and I know that you note in your report that you filed in February, that was mentioned there as well. I was just wondering if you could update us on the status of that in terms of the components that are being fabricated and so forth?","Jimmy Addison","Yes Dan the shield building is going probably better we had anticipated, our concern for the shield building really came from the contractor, their concerns at the time that was try to bridge an iron, now Fluor has taken over, but we still retained the CB&I services crew it that is doing that welding. So even though CB&I Power existed the consortium the CB&I services folks who are doing the curtailment vessel welding and the shield building welding stay and they are doing tremendous job.","There is about 16 courses of this steel that goes up to form a shield building, usually a course at a time welded together then fill course with concrete. So we've got to three those courses that have been placed welded and filled with concrete, the fourth course has been placed, it\u2019s being welded did, we anticipate filling that with concrete sometimes in the next couple of weeks.","The deliveries are coming in from an entity called Newport News Industrial, NNI in Virginia. And those folks are working very hard to meet out schedule and we\u2019re looking at diversifying that supply chain a little but perhaps moving some of those modules to another vendor to free up a little bit of space at NNI. So over, I would say the shield building is going a little better than we expected.","Dan Jenkins","How many of those components are you still waiting on with the shield building?","Jimmy Addison","I wound say it is for the first Unit-2 we've probably get two-third of the shield building panels that we need and for the trailing unit, Unit-3 we probably only have about a third of them and so we are still waiting on about two-thirds.","Dan Jenkins","Okay and then on Unit-3 what\u2019s the current critical path item for that unit?","Jimmy Addison","It runs through the shield building as well Dan. So it\u2019s still shield building, either you know we\u2019re talking about it, it runs through shield building.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Okay that\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Jimmy Addison","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Paul Patterson, Glenrock Associates","Paul Patterson","Good afternoon.","Steve Byrne","Hello Paul.","Paul Patterson","How are you doing?","Steve Byrne","Great. How about it.","Paul Patterson","I'm managing, I guess. Just wanted to ask you about the fixed price option, and if you were to select that, what the impact is in terms of does it change the way the payments would go? Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that?","Steve Byrne","Paul from payment prospective Jimmy lead to early, we\u2019re changing the way that we make the payments here to Fluor, we've had payments based on either hitting milestone or what we call progress payments. Progress payments is a bit of miss number really what we try to actual progress so we changed that and when we go forward, you\u2019re negotiating a milestones payment schedule so the construction milestone payment schedule which will have us paying only for milestones achieved.","Paul Patterson","Okay. I guess what I'm wondering is in terms of the, you guys have not decided on whether or not you're going to go for the fixed price option, is that correct?","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s correct","Paul Patterson","If you were to go for it, does that change the payments, or does that change the schedule in payments, do you pay anything up front, or is it pretty much the same way? Would you be paying over the same time frame pretty much the same amount with this milestone? That's it.","Steve Byrne","Yes so for what we done as we get an estimate for what is the non-fix price option if we select the fix price option there is an added cost that comes with taking that risk away if you will and so I\u2019ll do as well just take that additional cost it will be stretched out over the entire project, so it\u2019s if they want that should be front loaded or just picking the milestones which indicate we\u2019re progress will attach payments to those milestones and when the over it has six milestone will make payments even but the additional cross just gets spread out over the remainder of the project.","Paul Patterson","Okay, that\u2019s it from me. Thanks so much.","Operator","Next question is from Andy Levi at Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","I guess I'm just going to go back to Toshiba. I want to get something clarified. Because if you were to choose the fixed cost option, which seems to be the right way to go, and obviously, you got rid of CBI, so that was a very good thing that you guys did and have Fluor in there. But given Toshiba's continued financial issues and concern about the Company's, or our concerns and I guess sell-side analysts concerns about the long-term viability of the Company, can you tell us what type of protections you have in place to protect SCANA and the summer project from Toshiba's potential insolvency relative to the fixed cost contract and their ability to execute on that? And then can you get more into also the surety bond that you have, the amount that you have and how that would work if you had to call on that. Because we saw with Portland General having to call on their surety bond with Abengoa, it just wasn't that simple. Thank you.","Steve Byrne","Okay Andy its Steve. Let me start now I\u2019ll let Jimmy to finish maybe a little bit on the surety bond, but surety bond [indiscernible] earlier was there really to create kind of a soft landing. So it would pay vendors that were in process and allow us to in a systematic logical fashion one project down to the point where Toshiba or Westinghouse could exit. Now we\u2019re presuming some kind of insolvency or bankruptcy you would also have to presume that Westinghouse doesn\u2019t survive that.","And so as a with that provision and as you are aware there can be various kinds of bankruptcy and it\u2019s doesn\u2019t necessary mean that the contractor stops working. So we\u2019re working hard to make sure that we\u2019re not in advance of payments and then we have information that includes source codes, software and proprietary design information that\u2019s being escrowed and the bankruptcy or insolvency would be one of the triggers that gives me that information and then we would look to finish plan on our own.","We could do that one of the couple of ways, we could either act as our own general contractor, which will be more comfortable now than when we originally signed up for the projects since we've made some of the progress and we understand that this construction progress. And we would go out and get a subcontracted construction under, presumably Fluor since they are already on site, already familiar with means and method and know the project or we could EPC it again.","So we could give it to an EPC contractors, certainly Fluor would in a good position, they are an EPC contractor. So we could give it to them. So the important part to me is that I have the information that I need to be able to finish the plant on my own and that's the whole reason why we're escrowing.","Andrew Levi","But I guess the issue that I see, though, is that, I guess the thing that was a big positive was this fixed cost contract, right, because it kind of eliminates certain downside above the $500 million escalation in the cost of the contract. And so, if that contract is with an entity that is not a good counterparty, that fixed cost contract is not really worth a lot I guess. That's what I'm really getting at is, not as much the ability to finish the plant or the construction aspect of it, but the ability to control the cost if, in a negative case, Toshiba doesn't have the money to pay above the $500 million escalation that you're willing to pay in a fixed cost option.","Steve Byrne","As I said earlier Andy what we have on our side though is some time to watch out the progress and to see how that going. We've got another six-months before we get to make this call. They have said publically that this business is one of three key areas of focus for them and they are shedding the other businesses. They brought $6.5 billion well as soon as the sales close here shortly. Everything they have said they are going to do it appears they have done at this point in a very efficient manner. So we've got several more months to watch this and monitor the situation.","Andrew Levi","I just get concerned because I see the stock trading a little over $1. Just on the surety bond, could you just go over that and the amount of that and how that would work and who would be paying you?","Steve Byrne","Yes, so it\u2019s actually it can be either an surety bond or in letters of credit, we've allowed them to provide that through letters of credit and we are comfortable with the counter parties there and it is an annual calculation based upon the estimated quarterly payments in the next year. So we've made that calculation for 2016, we've elected it and those letters of credit are in place now.","Andrew Levi","And who's the letter of credit with? Is it funded the letter of credit? How does that work?","Steve Byrne","It\u2019s a letter of credit in case they default on any of the provisions.","Andrew Levi","That's for $100 million, is that for $100 million?","Steve Byrne","It\u2019s that a maximum of $100 million based upon the projected cash flows of the year that\u2019s applicable and so it will change each year.","Andrew Levi","And then as far as on the creditor side, because Southern also has a fixed cost contract according to them, I mean, who would get paid first? I guess we don't know, that right? Because Southern would have the same issue.","Steve Byrne","No, no, no its I mean - well this is\u2026","Andrew Levi","I don't mean on the surety bond. I'm talking about as far as the ability for Toshiba to perform on a fixed cost contract.","Steve Byrne","I can\u2019t answer that.","Andrew Levi","Alright. Okay. Thank you, very much.","Operator","Next question is from Claire Tse at Wolfe Research.","David Paz","Hi, actually it's David Paz. Just a quick question on your long-term growth rate. What earned ROEs are you assuming both at the SCE&G business and the PSNC business.","Steve Byrne","Yes so at SCE&G, David, we're consistent on the base business at above 9%, is our strategy to stay out of any base rate increases outside of the BLRA and the BLRA of course is at 10.5%, and PSNC we've got a current allowed 10.6%.","David Paz","Okay. So even in the PSNC case, we should think about, even though rate base growing faster than in the past, you still anticipate somewhere in that mid 10 earned ROEs through the period of your long-term growth rate?","Jimmy Addison","Well that\u2019s for 10.6 in the case, we will have to wait and see how that situation comes out either through negotiations or through hearing with the Commission, but we'll he know that in another - within six-months.","David Paz","Okay. And then also, with respect to your growth rate, what sales growth are you assuming through that period? On the electric side.","Jimmy Addison","It's above 1.2%.","David Paz","1.2%. Okay. That's a CAGR?","Jimmy Addison","Yes.","David Paz","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Andrew Weisel at Macquarie Group.","Andrew Weisel","Thank you. Just want to clarify timing of this nuclear fixed option, if you do exercise it or not. It seems to me like there are a couple different steps here, I just want to understand when we can expect each and what order. So you're going to make a decision. You're going to file with regulators. You're going to tell us about it. And you're going to officially exercise the option with the contractors. Is that the right order? And what might the time line of those four pieces look like?","Steve Byrne","Andrew, what we say is, we are going to make that decision sometime in the second quarter, then we will file between the filing and the public service commission rendering an opinion is six-months, and intervening six-months we will file testimony. There will be testimony filed from any interveners, and then we will have a hearing, which will be a public hearing. We have until November 1, to let Westinghouse whether we have opted for that fixed price option. And we can do that basically any time from now until November 1.","Jimmy Addison","And I would just add, we are going to let you know exactly concurringly what the time we file.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. So, the filing could come very shortly after you make your decision, and that process can be underway by the time you officially exercise the option with Westinghouse?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I would think that it would be well underway, before we officially exercise the option with Westinghouse, because the option with Westinghouse is subject regulatory approval.","Andrew Weisel","Right. Good point. And then, in terms of updating the CapEx and financing costs, would that update come only in the next quarterly earnings call, or potentially when you announce to us that you've made a decision and are filing with regulators one way or the other?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, so there is two different moving parts there, one is which option do we go with just amend the contract or to go with the fixed option. The second moving part to that is getting the revised payment schedule worked out between us and the contractor. So those two don't necessarily happen at the same time, so it may be that we are in a position and make the filing and notify you of which option we have chosen but haven\u2019t yet completely agreed on the payment schedule. So we can't completely update the CapEx schedule until we get both of those done.","Andrew Weisel","What's the latest time that you would get the updated finance, or payment schedule, rather?","Jimmy Addison","I don\u2019t know a firm answer on that because it could be that we have to use this option as the - I don\u2019t know this, but it could be we have to use its resolution board to resolve any differences we have there. So that could add some time on the end of it, but I would hope all of that \u2013 Steve is it reasonable to say we hope to get all of that done this year?","Steve Byrne","Yes, absolutely.","Jimmy Addison","Yes.","Andrew Weisel","Alright great, looking forward to your decision. Thank you.","Jimmy Addison","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Feliks Kerman at Visium Asset Management","Feliks Kerman","Hi, just to clarify on that last question, because the petition process takes six months for approval, is it fair to say that the associated increased equity needs would come more like a 2017 item at the end of the petition, or more of an upfront related issuance? Any color on the timing?","Jimmy Addison","We don\u2019t know anything of this point, this is we need any equity until 2017 at the earliest. Recall we sold these two subsidiaries last year, realized about $425 million plus of cash after tax from that. So in the short-term, we've used that to defray some debt, but we have got plenty of that to sustain us through the 2015.","Feliks Kerman","And that's even if you choose the fixed-price option?","Jimmy Addison","Excuse me 2016. Again, I don\u2019t know what the revised payments schedule is going to be so we just don\u2019t have that at this point. So we would have to have that but nothing we know at this point says we've got anything additional related to that. As Steve said earlier, we are planning on paying the - if we elected the fixed price we would pay that ratably over the remaining life remaining life of the construction, it's not a lump payment.","Feliks Kerman","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well thank you and we will look forward to finalizing this decision on the fixed-price option and the subsequent petition to be filed with the PSC. We continue to focus on our new nuclear construction and on operating all of our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. And we thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA. Have a good day.","Operator","This conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect."],"19219":["SCANA Corporation (NYSE:SCG) Q2 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call July 28, 2016  3:00 AM ET","Executives","Susan Wright - Director of Financial Planning & IR","Jimmy Addison - CFO","Steve Byrne - COO of SCE&G","Analysts","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Jim von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse","Travis Miller - Morningstar","Andrew Weisel - Macquarie Capital Securities","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, July 28, 2016. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2016. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments we will respond to your questions.","The slides and earnings release referenced to on this call are available at SCANA.com. Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other investor information directly to our website at SCANA.com. On SCANA's homepage, there is a yellow box containing links to the nuclear development and other investor information sections of the website. It is possible that some of the information that we post directly to our website may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. You can sign-up for email alerts under the investors section of SCANA.com to notify you when there is a new posting in the nuclear development and\/or other investor information sections of the website.","Finally, before I turn over the call to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements may be made during today's call that are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on slide 2. The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation. The required Reg G information be found in the investors section of our website under webcasts and presentations. I now will turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on slide 3. Earnings in the second quarter of 2016 were $0.74 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015.","Our electric margins benefit from a base load review act rate increase and customer growth but were partially offset by milder weather in the second quarter of 2016 when compared to the same quarter of last year and slightly lower average use. Results also improved due to increase gas margins at SCANA Energy and the positive impact of the depreciation study. As you will recall, this is the last quarter that a positive bottom-line impact will be realized from this study on a comparative basis.","Additionally, increases in O&M a property taxes had a negative impact on earnings. At the bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather increased electric margins by $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 and $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in a negative $0.01 per share impact to earnings quarter over quarter.","Please turn to slide 4. Earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $1.97 versus $3.49 in 2015. The decline in results is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sale of CGT and SCI and a negative year-over-year impact from weather.","Otherwise, higher electric margins due primarily to a base load review act rate increase and customer growth, as well as the depreciation study impact, were offset by lower gas margins and expected increases in O&M and CapEx-related items, including interest and property taxes. Electric margins through the first two quarters of 2016 were unaffected on a net basis by abnormal weather which is down $0.11 when compared to the benefit from abnormal weather through June 30, 2015.","And now on slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's second-quarter 2016 earnings were up $0.02 per share compared to the same period of 2015. The increase in earnings is due to a higher electric margins, principally as a result of the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth, partially offset by milder weather during the second quarter of 2016 versus the same period of 2015 and lower average use. The impact of the previously mentioned depreciation study also contributed to earnings for the quarter.","These items were partially offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expenses, as well as increases in expenses related to our capital program, including interest expense property taxes. Year to date, SCE&G's earnings were down by $0.06, due to primarily to milder weather than was experienced in 2015.","PSNC Energy's reported seasonal flat earnings in the second quarter of 2016, consistent with the same quarter of the prior year. For the six month period ended June 30, earnings were up $0.01 per share in 2016 over the comparative period of 2015.","SCANA Energy, which includes SCANA Energy Marketing and SCANA Energy Georgia, showed an increase in second-quarter earnings of $0.02 per share, primarily due to higher margins during the second quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015. Year-to-date earnings are $0.17 per share compared to $0.21 per share in the prior year, down primarily due to milder weather in the first quarter.","Additionally, I'm pleased to report that SCANA Energy has been granted a one-year extension to serve as the regulated provider for the state of Georgia. This additional year will be added on to the current term and will and in August 2018. SCANA Energy has served as the regulated provider since the program's inception in 2002.","SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in the second quarter of 2016 compared to a loss of $0.06 per share in the comparative quarter. For the six month period these businesses reported a loss of $0.05 per share in 2016 compared to earnings of $1.38 in 2015, primarily due to the net of tax gains on the sales of CGT and SCI of $1.41 per share, as well as the foregone earnings contributed by CGT and SCI prior to the closing of the sales in the first quarter of 2015.","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on slide 6. The Carolinas environment continues to prosper and we are pleased by the continuous growth in our service territories, as evidenced by an announcements to invest approximately $1.5 billion with the expectation of creating approximately 3,300 jobs. At the bottom of the slide you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory.","South Carolina's unemployment rate is now at 5.4% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 4.4%. Attesting to our safe strong economic growth, almost 70,000 more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. Saw a 7% customer growth in electric sales statistics.","On the top half of the slide is the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at a rate of 3% and 2.9%, respectively. This is the first time PSNC's growth rate has hit 3% since the early stages of the 2008 recession. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region which is a key fundamental.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales are up 0.3% on a 12-month ended basis.","Now please turn to slide 8 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $9.7 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended June 30, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate related increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy.","As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside of a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, then we file to adjust rates under the rate stabilization act. As of March 31, 2016, the 12-month earned return was below the band and we recently filed for an annual increase of approximately $4 million in mid June.","As you are also aware, during the first quarter of 2016 we filed an application with the North Carolina utilities commission requesting annual revenue increases of $41.6 million at PSNC Energy in response to the normal attrition in the earned returns in that business. This rate increase is the result of PSNC's need to recover cost to operate and expand its pipeline system and to implement a pipeline integrity management rider.","The ride would allow PSNC to track and receive ongoing recovery of capital expenses related to its distribution and transmission pipeline integrity management programs. A hearing with the North Carolina Utility Commission on this rate case is scheduled for August 30.","Slide 9 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects the Company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2018 and reflects the fixed price option spending as represented in the petition testimony as filed on July 1. As a reminder, these schedules reflect existing payment plan and do not incorporate the construction payment milestone schedule, as it is still under negotiation.","Therefore, it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new nuclear equip from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.","Slide 10 presents information regarding certain transitional payments being made in 2016 as it pertains to the construction payment milestone schedule and the settlement agreement. Once the construction payment milestone schedule is complete, we will update the CapEx schedule and the corresponding financing plan.","Now please turn to slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. In June of this year, SCE&G issued $425 million of 30-year bonds at 4.1%. And re-opened and issued $75 million of bonds as part of a previous 4.5% series due June 1, 2064. Additionally, PSNC issued a 30-year private placement $100 million at 4.13%. I would like to thank our banks and fixed-income investors for their support of our liquidity needs.","As a reminder, we have switched to open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill our 401(k) and drip plans, at least until we fully utilized the net cash proceeds from the sales of CGT and SCI. We do not anticipate the need for further equity issuances until 2017. It is unlikely that these issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented, as they are subject to changes in our funding needs for planned project expenses. We continue to adjust the financing to match the related project CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Again, this financing plan does not represent the election of the fixed-price option will conform this plan and the CapEx plan once we reach agreement on the construction payment milestone schedule later this year.","On slide 12 we are reaffirming our 2016 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guides as $3.90 to $4.10 per share with an internal target of $4 per share. However, I did want to take a moment and revise our operation and maintenance expense projection for the year.","We previously issued O&M guidance for 2016 at approximately 2% higher than 2015. O&M has since outpaced that guidance rate, primarily due to increasing pension expense which is offset with a pension rider in revenues and higher incentive compensation accruals as a result of the year-to-date stock performance.","Pension expense has increased due to the lower discount rate associated with falling interest rates which is applied to the projected liability. Although this incremental pension expense has no net effect on bottom-line earnings, we are updating our O&M guidance for 2016 to approximate 4% higher than 2015.","Our long-term GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized average annual growth guidance target remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 4% to 6% earnings growth over 3 to 5 years using a base of 2015's GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.73 per share. And I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. I'd like to begin by addressing the status of our current regulatory proceedings. Slide 13 presents the relative schedules for two filings. The first is an update petition which includes our selection of the fixed-price option and the second is our annual request for revised rates.","At the beginning of July we filed our direct testimony for our update petition and anticipate a hearing in October with an order in late November. The Office of Regulatory Staff, or ORS, will be issuing their report sometime in the next month or so regarding our annual request for revised rates and we also anticipate that concluding in late November.","Slide 14 presents the projected costs associated with our update petition. Please note that we have removed the additional transmission costs originally requested in the petition from our testimony filing, as we are evaluating other alternatives to installing additional capacitors in the Unit 1 switch yard.","Moving on to some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site, slide 15 presents an aerial photo of what we call the Tabletop from June of this year. This photo gives you a view of the layout of the site and I've labeled both Units 2 and 3, as well as many of the other areas of the construction site.","Slide 16 presents a schematic view of the five large structural modules that are located inside the containment vessel. As you will recall, we have previously placed modules CA01, 04 and 05 for Unit 2 and CA04 and 05 for Unit 3. And more recently we placed module CA03 for Unit 2 which you will see shortly.","Site 17 shows an aerial view of the Unit 2 nuclear island and containment from last week. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section, as well as modules CA01, 03, 04 and 05. Outside the containment vessel you can see auxiliary building module CA20, the shield building which surrounds the containment vessel and the battery rooms.","Slide 18 shows a few pictures of the Unit 2 CA02 module. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. CA02 is structurally complete and should be installed this quarter.","Slide 19 shows a picture of the Unit 2 CA03 module which is the west wall of the in-containment refueling water storage tank. This module was set in place last week.","Slide 20 shows the continued fabrication of sub-assemblies 1 and 2 for the Unit 3 module CA20. This is an auxiliary building module that is located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. As you may recall, this module consists of four sub-assemblies and sub-assemblies 3 and 4 were previously placed in an effort to move forward with the shield building erection which is the next critical path item. All acquired sub-modules for sub-assemblies 1 and 2 are on site and they'll be placed once fabrication is complete.","Slide 21 shows a picture of the fabrication of the Unit 3 module CA01. This module houses the steam generators and the pressurizer and forms a refueling canal inside the containment vessel. Currently, all 47 sub-modules are on site and 21 of those sub-modules are upright and being welded together in the module assembly building.","On slide 22 you can see one of the two steam generators for Unit 3 that arrived on the construction site in late April. It was transported from the Port of Charleston on a specifically designed railcar. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds, it's about 20 feet in diameter and it's almost 82 feet long. The other Unit 3 steam generator and the last one for the project is scheduled to be delivered during the fourth quarter of this year.","Slide 23 shows you a picture of the Sanmen in China. This past May Westinghouse completed the cold hydrostatic testing at Sanmen Unit 1. The successful completion of this test confirms that the reactor systems meet design pressures under operating and accident conditions. This is great news for the AP1000 design and Sanmen Unit 1 is expected to load fuel by the end of the year. Another Chinese AP1000 unit, Haiyang Unit 1, completed its cold hydro test in early July.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Julien Dumoulin-Smith of UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin","Hi, good afternoon. So I wanted to follow up a little bit on the timeline and schedule on the project and specifically on the milestones. If you could provide a little bit more of an update there. And ultimately if and\/or when you expect to do -- or hear back from Fluor on more of an integrated schedule update for the overall project.","Steve Byrne","Yes, Julien, this is Steve. The guaranteed suspension completion dates remain at August of 2019 for Unit 2 and August 2020 for Unit 3. We don't see anything to change those. Fluor's review of the schedule is really something that should conclude somewhere in the third quarter and then they will be giving that to Westinghouse.","And remember that on the project now we're just dealing with Westinghouse, Fluor is a subcontractor to Westinghouse. I don't expect anything necessarily to change from that review, save for perhaps the number of hours it might take and shifts that they would have to put on, that kind of thing. So the goal of that schedule review was to hold the dates constant and see what it would take to accomplish those dates. So I don't expect anything dramatic to come from that.","With respect to milestones, the CA03 lift and set for Unit 2 was completed last week, as I think you saw in the photographs. We would intend to set the second half of auxiliary building module CA20 probably next week. If not, then the week after. So we're actually taking the end off the module assembly building as we speak in order to get that module out. So that'll be another large lift. That'll be for Unit 3.","We've got a module called CA02 which should be the last of the big five modules to go in the Unit 2 containment building. That should come later in August. And then we've got condenser sections that we'll be setting for Unit 3, that's the turbine building side. And one of our goals this year is to set and align the reactor vessel for Unit 2. We hope to do that sometime in September.","Julien Dumoulin","Got it, excellent. And just to be clear about this, basically what you're suggesting is you could very well see Fluor accelerate, improve their productivity, ramp up hiring in order to meet the existing targets, right? Is that the right way to think about it?","Steve Byrne","Everything that they are doing has meeting the existing targets in mind. And they are, as we speak, accelerating their hiring, have done a pretty good job in about the last 3 to 4 months after a relatively slow start early in their tenure on the project which was January, February. They've certainly picked up the pace significantly now but everything they are doing is to hold of the dates constant.","Julien Dumoulin","And to quickly clarify on the milestone payments, where do you stand in that process? And what's expectation for the outcome there?","Steve Byrne","With regard to the milestone payments, the milestones are not in dispute, the total payment is not in dispute. Since we're electing a fixed-price option, we know what the final price is going to be. Really the only thing we're discussing with Westinghouse is the timing for those payments. And so we are still in discussions with them relative to those timings and we would anticipate a positive result sometime in the next couple weeks. I don't see anything to change that.","Should we not come to a resolution, then we've got a mechanism in place now that we negotiated in our October amendment to the EPC contract, and that's a dispute resolution board. That dispute resolution board has been set, so it's a three-person board. And if we can't agree on it, then we just take it to the dispute resolution board and they can resolve it. And they have to have it resolved in 60 days.","Julien Dumoulin","And very quickly, lastly, in terms of the process itself for the fixed-price option, is it potential or would you expect a settlement with parties?","Steve Byrne","With regard to our case before the public service commission for the fixed price option? I would anticipate that once the final roster of interveners is compiled, that we will enter into settlement discussions with those interveners.","Very similar to what we did the last time which was in 2015, we did reach a settlement agreement with a number of the interveners but we never reached a settlement agreement with all of the interveners. So there will be a hearing. We do anticipate that we would have a settlement agreement with the some of the interveners but not all.","Julien Dumoulin","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Hi, a couple questions on the nuclear then some on financial. Could you comment a little bit on the CB&I Westinghouse litigation and whether there's any direct or indirect impact on either SCE&G or SCANA?","Steve Byrne","Yes, Jim, this is Steve. We are aware of the lawsuit. We were made aware of it the day that it was filed. We don't see any implications to SCE&G or SCANA and we can't comment on the merits of the case for either party.","Jim von Riesemann","That's fine, okay. But no issue for you guys?","Steve Byrne","We don't see any issues.","Jim von Riesemann","Then secondly, can you talk about some of these Chamber of Commerce articles that are appearing in the Post and Courier about their desire to have the BLRA re-opened?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I'll be glad to come in on that briefly, Jim. First of all, that is not the State Chamber or the local Chamber. That is what's called the Small Business Chamber and that is a person that has intervened and our prior proceedings, I believe, Steve, all the way to our initial citing and approval of the plant to begin. So that's not a new party to this discussion.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. Switching over to the financial discussion, can you remind us what the weather impact has been on SCANA for the trailing 12 months? I know it's $0.11 year to date, I guess that's on a relative to the prior period. So how do you get -- I guess the real question I have is how do you get to your internal $4 a share target, especially in light of some of the other disclosures to you made today?","Jimmy Addison","Let me clarify. First of all, we are not providing GAAP-adjusted numbers anymore. It's pretty clear, you've probably seen it. The SEC is discouraging any of that so we're going to stay away from that. I don't think that was aimed at our industry, but we're going to steer clear.","Year to date for SCANA from the electric side of the business for 2016, there's no impact from weather compared it to our plan. There is impact compared to 2015's first half of the year because it was very cold in Q1 of 2015 and very warm in Q2 of 2015. But for 2016 the weather has been, quote, normal on a net basis. It was mild in Q1 but it was warmer in Q2, so we're on plan from a weather standpoint through midyear.","I don't really pay a lot of attention to trailing 12 months when it straddles year-end like that because there's so much difference in our business with the BLRA increases that are near calendar year-end. And in the past it's been around the first of November, now they'll be a little later than that. As well as our RSA increases when they occur in the LDC in South Carolina. So I pay less attention to the trailing 12 and try to just go off normal weather.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay. And tax rates, I know, for the second quarter trended down from what you had indicated for the year. Is there anything we should think about tax rates over the second half of the year?","Jimmy Addison","No, there's nothing really to read into that at this point based on what you've seen. I actually asked that very question earlier this week myself. We're a little lower than we guided. We guided at 32% and I think we still projected it would -- based on where we are today that would still be in the ballpark of 32%.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay, great. And then last thing, just to be clear, when you announced your 4% to 6% of earnings growth rate aspirations for the coming three to five years, those EPS growth aspirations were prior to your election of a fixed-price contract. So I guess the question is, that would imply EPS could change if the PSC approves the fixed-price option contract, correct?","Jimmy Addison","I'm not saying that. We'll certainly re-look at our earnings guidance if they approve it, but we would refresh everything like we do every quarter when we look at it. So I can't suggest to you that it would change because of that but we'll certainly re-look at it. Of course, we expect that the impact of that, once we either agree or the resolution board gives us a payment schedule, we expect that will be spread out over several years.","So to say that it would necessarily change that rate, I couldn't get to that yet.","Jim von Riesemann","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Weinstein of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys. I just wanted to confirm that the CapEx update for nuclear, does that include or exclude the fixed-price option cost at this time? I mean, it was increased but --","Jimmy Addison","Yes, it does included it, it does include the fixed price option. What it doesn't include, obviously because we haven't reached agreement, is the payment schedule changes. And as Steve said earlier, that won't change what we pay, it just will obviously change the buckets of years when we pay it. So we'll have to adjust this once we reach that agreement.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. And with the final order not expected until November, does that mean that the fixed price option becomes irrevocable on November 1, is that right?","Steve Byrne","Well, unless it's not -- it's subject to approval by the commission.","Michael Weinstein","Right. So it's a regulatory out but essentially after November -- you've already chosen is, right? So on November 1 it becomes set in stone unless there's a regulatory problem.","Steve Byrne","Yes, that's right, and I can't imagine why we would not want to elect it.","Michael Weinstein","Right. And what was the difference between the $55 million and the $11.5 million monthly payment? Remind me of that.","Jimmy Addison","The $55 million is simply our 55% share of the $100 million we agreed to pay each month. And then the $11 million is just the installment payments associated with the EPC. That's the settlement of the $137 million gross for the settlement of all the outstanding dispute items.","Michael Weinstein","I see, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good afternoon, thank you. Question on this petition. What's the chance that when you guys go there and regulators, interveners start debating, that we could end up in a situation where there is a reopening of some other issue or regulators decide to take back something? You guys went through this a couple years ago on the ROE. Is that something that would be open for debate? Are there other places in the full contract, full BLRA that would be open for debate?","Jimmy Addison","The ROE was set in the initial approval by the commission at 11%. The only reason that came back into play last time we were there, is we agreed in settlement discussions to put that on the table in order to reach the settlement we did. So that can only be changed if we choose to put that on the table.","Steve Byrne","That was done in that seven-month proceeding in order to gain the settlement of those intervening parties. And outside of that, what the public service commission is supposed to rule on is the petition that is before them and not other things. So basically those other things have already been decided. We're looking for a change and they're to rule on the change that we're asking for.","Jimmy Addison","Based upon, obviously, the prudent standard.","Travis Miller","Sure, okay. Is it possible that ROE or some other issue could come up in the settlement? Or you guys would do that kind of give and take?","Jimmy Addison","Well, as Steve read earlier, we'll first have wait and see who's interested in being in the discussions and then we'll see -- negotiations are always unique. We'll have to wait and see how it develops.","Travis Miller","Okay. And then on the gas customer side, you guys have been putting up some good growth numbers there on the customer side. How long -- what's the runway for this 3% gas customer growth?","Jimmy Addison","You mean on a projected basis?","Travis Miller","Yes, you guys have been -- put up very impressive numbers here on the 3% gas customer growth. I'm just wondering how long does that last? How many more customers are out there that you can get for that?","Jimmy Addison","Obviously it's made up of a couple things. It's made of the core housing growth. So the housing growth -- you might look at like this -- and the electric growth is 1.6%. So most of those, not all, but most of those are going to have gas if it's accessible because it's so much more affordable and it's a fuel of choice, people like it. I personally like it. I like it for a heater or water heater or clothes dryer, et cetera.","But then on top of that, you've got penetration of existing homes because of the price. It's so much more affordable with the price of shale gas today and the market for folks to use it for heating and water heating and things of that nature. So you've got the double benefit of that, if you will.","So I think it's interesting. I was looking at some stats earlier today about the economic projections for the Carolinas. And for the first time in several years, the multi-unit housing is projected over the next couple of years to drop as far as the number of units. And single-family housing is projected to increase.","In South Carolina single-family permits are projected over the next couple years to go up 20%, while multi-family is projected to go down 20%. In North Caroling it's even more exaggerated, up 25% and down 35%.","I think what we're reaching is more of this relative saturation of these multi-unit on a relative basis. I'm not saying there won't be more built but compared it to single-family units, you're starting to see single-families grow faster than the multi-family. You're going to see a lot more of those single-family units using natural gas. So I think that's going to be a big driver as well.","Travis Miller","Read into that the single-family's better for you guys from a customer growth standpoint, right?","Jimmy Addison","Absolutely, and not just for gas but also for electricity. I mean, your average single-family home is going to be larger than your average multi-family unit. A lot of those customers we've been adding the last several years have been -- while they've been nice growth in numbers, they've not been the size units that they were obviously in 2006 or 2007. And I don't see that returning as far as the size of those homes, but I do see more and more of the makeup being relative in single-family.","Travis Miller","Great, thanks so much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","Hi, good afternoon, everybody. First question I wanted to ask was about the dispute resolution board. If I understood correctly, you're still talking with Westinghouse and have not yet -- I don't know what the right word is -- filed with the DRB? Is that right? And if so, at what point would you submit all the requests to the DRB to get that 60-day clock started?","Steve Byrne","Andrew, you're correct that we have not yet submitted anything to the DRB. I would imagine that we will probably submit something within the next couple of weeks. That's not to say that we couldn't submit and then still come to an agreement after we submit and then withdraw it. So we'll probably submit in the next couple weeks, at least to start the clock. Then I wouldn't preclude the fact that we might not reach a settlement anyway with Westinghouse and then withdraw it.","Andrew Weisel","Is there a reason you didn't submit when you issued that 8-K last month?","Steve Byrne","No, we're looking at timing around other things, the 8-K was not necessarily a consideration.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Then in terms of the sequence of events, we've got a couple things coming up. There's that we just talked about. There's the Fluor report to Westinghouse, there's the ORS report. And then there's the potential settlement that ahead of hearings.","Is there any specific order in which those have to happen? In other words, is it possible that ORS might not be able to or want to file their report until the Fluor report is in? Or how should I think about that sequence?","Steve Byrne","The ORS report is separate from the update proceeding. The ORS report is relative to our annual rate filing. So remember, we have got two things going on with regard to new nuclear.","There's the update petition which gets the fixed-price option into the public service commission for their approval. And then we have an annual rate adjustment which we've been filing every year since we started the construction. There's no hearing associated with that but ORS does submit a report.","So really the two are separate and running along separate tracks. They just happened to conclude at the same time frame in November, probably in late November. So don't think that the ORS report is relative to the update petition.","Jimmy Addison","I'd say the things that are fairly firm, we have a hearing date starting October 5. We have a date that ORS is to submit their testimony in the update preceding of September 1. We've of course already submitted ours.","And the commission has a practice, generally, of preferring to see settlements filed a week or more before a proceeding begins, just so they have time to digest the settlement document. That's not always doable, based upon parties and negotiations and things that happen on the steps, that kind of thing. But that is the goal, is to have it sometime so they've got time to digest it before it starts.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. And to clarify, if you file with the DRB in a few weeks, call it mid August, if they take the full two months, that takes us to mid October, that is after the October 5 hearing is scheduled for the petition. But those are separate things, right? In other words, the DRB potential intervention wouldn't have anything to do with the schedule or decision around the updated petition. Is that fair?","Steve Byrne","Yes, they are not necessarily tied to each other. Now, we may file, I'd say within the next couple weeks. We could file next week. So they could actually get synched up but I wouldn't read too much into that.","Jimmy Addison","What we're asking the commission to approve is the prudence of these costs, not necessarily the buckets of when they'll be paid.","Andrew Weisel","Got it. Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Jenkins from State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","Hi, good afternoon. I had a question on slide 7 where you show the weather-adjusted change. I noticed compared to this same slide last quarter, it appears to be down by about 1% for most of the customer classes and overall. I was wondering if you could give any color on what -- are you seeing a slow-down? It looks like the customer growth still looks pretty strong. I was just curious about the kilowatt sales growth.","Jimmy Addison","I would not -- I personally don't read that into it at this point. I mean, obviously, the base numbers are lower but that is a 12-month moving average so you're dropping off a quarter from 2015, picking up another quarter here. We don't like to get into the individual quarters themselves because that introduces more volatility. But the pipeline, as you saw from the slide before that, the pipeline is still full.","And economic announcements just this week, the Mercedes plant announced that -- a previous announcement from a while back that they're breeding ground on the plant now and they're adding 1,300 workers with another 700 expected to be parts suppliers down in our Charleston territory. So there's a lot going on out there now. I don't really read anything into that as far as a trend.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then I just had a question. I know you mentioned on the nuclear update the shield building is still one of the critical path items. I was wondering if you could give a little color in terms of where you're at in terms of the panels on site and what's still being fabricated or constructed up at Newport News and so forth in terms of that item.","Steve Byrne","Yes, Dan, this is Steve. The shield building panels, Newport News continues to do a good job, both with timely deliveries and with quality. We probably got about two-thirds of the panels on site for Unit 2, maybe a third on site for Unit 3 and those are going very well. We've had good success with the fit-up of the panels so far.","So what we're doing now is we're actually welding those panels together in pairs. And we actually lift them in pairs and put them in. These are 40-foot curved panels, so when we weld them together we get 80-foot curved panels. It's one less lift you have to do to get two panels in. We're pouring concrete in the panels. We're through four courses. We need to get a couple of other things done around that now, so we're not waiting on the panels.","That work is going very well. Newport News is also getting the contract for the air inlet and tension ring portion of the shield building. So from our perspective, that's good news. The shield building is going well enough that I believe it is now off critical path for the trailing unit, Unit 3. Is still critical path for the first unit, Unit 2. But for the trailing unit it's now off critical path, so that's good news.","Dan Jenkins","So when do you expect for Unit 2 that would be completed where you would have all the panels on site? Is that this year still?","Steve Byrne","Dan, I'm not sure when we would have them all on site. I'd imagine that would be this year, at least the panels up to the air inlet and tension ring. I would say there's 167 of those panels and I would imagine we would probably get all of those on site this year. I don't think we're scheduled to complete the shield building until sometime in 2018. So even if they're not on site this year that's not necessarily a hold-up.","What they've done is they've prioritized the panels so we're getting in the ones that we need earlier than later. So even if some of those units are not coming to us, it doesn't mean necessarily any delay.","Dan Jenkins","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Leslie [Pruett] of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, I'm sorry to ask this question because I'm sure you've already answered it, but as I compare the CapEx slide from the first quarter to the one from the second quarter, the new nuclear expenses are up $400 million. And so I just want to make sure I really understand what is and is not included in your new nuclear CapEx today.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, sure, Leslie so the short answer is the slides you're currently looking at in this presentation includes everything we know, includes all be fixed price option, et cetera. The only thing that we anticipate changing on that in the future is adjusting the nuclear, the years that the spend occurs in once we reach some type of agreement on this payment schedule. The one from Q1 included the settlement portion, the $137 million that we had reached settlement on, but since we, by that point, we did not have the entire $800 million-plus included for the fixed-price option, the $505 million for the fixed price plus the other items.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. So the remainder, the $852 million minus $137 million, that's the $418 million, sorry -- the other $300 million for the fixed price option would be in 2019, 2020.","Jimmy Addison","That's right.","Unidentified Analyst","The rest of the fixed-price option cost increase would be in the letter two years.","Jimmy Addison","That's right.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, got you. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Hi, guys. I'm trying to think about some of the changes on the nuclear, the mid-year equip balances. And if I go back to your EEI slide deck, that balance was expected to be for 2016, about $1.1 billion. And now you expect it to be about $665 million, so 48%, 50% reduction. That impacts -- I'm going to make sure I understand that correctly -- that impacts the rate increase that will go into effect in November of 2016.","Jimmy Addison","That's right.","Michael Lapides","And therefore, the bulk of the impact is really felt in the revenue seen at SCE&G in 2017.","Jimmy Addison","That's correct.","Michael Lapides","So you're expected -- if I just do like for like or one for one, CapEx and revenue -- you're expected nuclear revenue increase 2016 to 2017 is roughly $45 million, $50 million lower -- 45%, 50% lower that it would have been six or nine months ago because of a change of construction schedule.","Jimmy Addison","That's correct but I would caution you to look at the whole picture so the financing associated with that will be less too.","Michael Lapides","Right, you wouldn't issue nearly as much debt. You've reduced the equity balance as well. Understood.","Jimmy Addison","Exactly.","Michael Lapides","Okay. Just trying to make sure. I'm trying to think about -- this begins to look like much more of a, hey, the real big uplift and revenue doesn't really happen until 2018 and that assumes that the construction schedule doesn't push out any further based on whatever Fluor fined or other side.","Jimmy Addison","Michael, would agree with that. The caveat being the fixed-price payment schedule will have some impact on the buckets. It's obviously not going to change the increase this November. That's already, that die is cast, if you will, but it will have some impact on the other years.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. I have a gas question for you guys. You all talk a lot about gas customer demand growth. Can you talk about weather-normalized gas unit growth that you are seeing? I know you've got some decoupling on the gas side, but want to think about what you're actually seeing on the overall demand growth side. I know customer growth has been great.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Michael, I really am not prepared to give you anything on that and the reason is, it really doesn't impact us much. We've got the decoupler, purity coupler in North Carolina, so a absolute non-issue there on a real-time basis. And in South Carolina gas business, you've got the rate stabilization act that captures any of that, the most you'd have is a one-year lag. So it's really not a big impact for us, so we don't model it and spend a lot of time on it. I'm sure I could get that answer, but I just don't have it with me today.","Michael Lapides","Okay. I appreciate that, guys. I may want to follow up with you. Trying to think about the bigger, broader picture of midstream needs into the lower Carolinas, given really the uptick in gas usage you may be seeing. And whether that creates another investment opportunity for you down the road.","Jimmy Addison","I understand. Or someone else.","Michael Lapides","Understood, cool. All right, guys, thank you. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well, thank you. We've had a successful first half of 2016 and we look forward to concluding the regulatory proceedings before both the South Carolina and the North Carolina Public Service Commissions in the balance of the year. We continue to focus on our new nuclear construction and on operating all of our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. And we thank you all for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"19260":["SCANA Corporation (NYSE:SCG) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  2, 2012  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Byron Hinson - IR","Jimmy Addison - CFO","Steve Byrne - COO, SCE&G","Analysts","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","John Hanson - Presidus","Ashar Khan - Visium","Operator","At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. (Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron Hinson","Thank you. I'd like to welcome everyone to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the second quarter of 2012. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer, and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development on our service territory and regulatory activity, including our recently filed base rate case for our electric business. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our nuclear project, after which we'll respond to your questions. Slides and the earnings release that we'll refer to in this call are available at SCANA.com.","Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that maybe made during today's call which are not statements of historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties which are shown on Slide 2 and discussed in the company's SEC filings. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Finally, as noted on Slide 2, we will disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found in or not used in conjunction with this call.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Byron, and thank you all for joining us today. We're pleased with the financial results for the second quarter and the progress of our new nuclear efforts. Steve and I plan to thoroughly update you on both of these matters today.","As shown on Slide 3, basic earnings per share were $0.55 for the second quarter of 2012 versus $0.44 in 2011. Higher electric margin from increased consumption and rate increases under the Base Load Review Act was partially offset by the cost of our capital program, interest expense, depreciation, property taxes and share dilution.","Gas margins were also higher due to the rate increase under the Rate Stabilization Act. Operating and maintenance expenses grew slightly over the second quarter of 2011, largely due to the timing of plant expenses, healthcare cost and incentive compensation.","Please turn to Slide 4. As you can see, basic earnings per share for the six months ended June 30, 2012 were $1.48 versus $1.44 in 2011. Increases in electric margin were partially offset by lower gas margins in Georgia, due to the mild weather in the first quarter along with higher operating and maintenance expenses and higher expenses related to our capital program, specifically depreciation, property taxes, interest and share dilution.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to review results for our principal lines of business. Healthcare, and electric and gas companies 2012 second quarter basic earnings per share denoted in blue, were $0.59, an increase of $0.11 over the second quarter of 2011. Electric margin was higher due primarily to increases under the Base Load Review Act.","Additionally, we experienced increased non-weather related consumption during the quarter. This increase in margin was offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, interest expense and depreciation as well as share dilution. Year-to-date basic earnings were higher by $0.11 due primarily to higher electric margin.","PSNC energy shown in red, reported flat earnings per share for the second quarter of 2012 versus the seasonal loss of $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2011, increases in margin due to customer growth contributed to the improvement. For the six-month period ended June 30, 2012, basic earnings were $0.24 per share in line with the prior year.","SCANA energy in green reported the seasonal loss of $0.02 per share for the second quarter of 2012, consistent with last year. Year-to-date earnings are down $0.08 due to the impact of mild winter weather in the first quarter.","Our corporate and other businesses reported their loss for the quarter of $0.02 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. For the six-month period, these businesses reported earnings per share of $0.04 compared to $0.03 in the same period last year.","Next, I'd like to touch on economic trends in our service area, as shown on Slide 6. We continue to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. In the second quarter, company's announced plans to invest $289 million with expectations of creating over 350 jobs in our South Carolina territory.","Our gas businesses in North Carolina also saw a promising quarter of economic announcements, with companies projecting investment of $325 million and over 1,400 jobs. We are pleased that this year is shaping out to be another solid year in terms of economic development in our territories.","On the heels of these major economic announcements, unemployment rates remain stable. Major businesses such as Boeing and Amazon that have located in our territory hiring employees quickly, and we're pleased to see these recent industrial expansions translating into jobs.","We're also pleased with two recent developments related to the project to deepen the Port of Charleston. The Army Corps of Engineers originally anticipated the project would take up to eight years to complete. But a year into the project, they have announced it could finish in five years.","In addition, President Obama chose the Charleston Harbor deepening project as one of seven priority infrastructure projects nationwide. This project will enable larger cargo ships to enter the harbor and is expected to faster economic growth. This is key once the Panama Canal is deepened in 2014.","For the 12-month period ended June 30, 2012, total weather normalized electric sales to residential customer were up approximately 0.6%. Our commercial sales were relatively flat. Industrial sales were down 1.4%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of the fire, we discussed last quarter.","We understand this customer's production will likely be limited for the majority of the year. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 3%.","As you can see on Slide 7, we continue to see improvement in customer growth at our major regulated subsidiaries. For the last three quarters, customer growth has trended higher in our electric businesses as well as our regulating gas businesses in South and North Carolina. For June, those rates were 0.8%, 1.5% and 1.9% respectively. We're encouraged by this trend.","Please turn to Slide 8, which sort our regulated rate base, returns in South Carolina regulatory calendar. The data on this slide represents information as of the date of our most recent regulatory filings.","The pie chart on the upper left represents the components of regulated rate base of $7.1 billion. This is composed largely of SCE&G electric with close to $6 billion in total electric investment, as denoted in blue.","The chart to the right shows our actual and allowed regulatory returns for the period. Our regulated gas business in North Carolina continues to earn a steady return due to customer growth in their territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker.","Return on our regularly gas business in South Carolina dropped slightly after the winter season. In June, we requested an increase of $8.8 million under the Annual Rate Stabilization Act adjustment. This increase would bring the earned ROE for that business more closely in line with the allowed return of 10.25%.","As you are aware, we recently found an application for our rate increase for our retail electric business, which I will discuss more fully on the next slide. That application reflected an earned return of 7.26%. This reflects the full pro forma return considering all known and measurable adjustments as required when the case is filed.","Accordingly, it is lower than our actual return to reflect annualized costs, which aren't fully incorporated yet in the financials. For example, in the case, we propose an adjustment to annualized depreciation expense. As we've begun depreciating property at various points of the year, our test year must be adjusted to capture a full year depreciation expense for those items.","The bottom of the slide includes the two timelines depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2012. As you can see in the first timeline we've completed all but one of our planned regulatory filings outside of the new nuclear project. In November, we will undergo the annual review of our gas, fuel cost and SCE&G.","The second timeline provides you with scheduled planned filings related to the new nuclear project. In May, we filed our quarterly status report and annual revised rates request related to the project. The Regulatory Staff has audited our request for revised rates and we expect an order from the commission around the end of September.","When we make our filing for revised rates, we do so on May 30. But the period under review requires us to project our construction expenditures through the end of June. So we have a portion of the filing that is actually a forecast.","When ORS does their audit, they look at actual expenditures and the actual capital structure at June 30. Generally that true-up result in a minor adjustment to our request to reflect the actual cost. ORS submitted their report this week and recommended a final revenue increase of approximately $52 million.","In addition to these regular BLRA filings, we filed a petition to update our nuclear budget and schedule, which Steve will discuss in a few minutes. We will file our next quarterly status report in mid-August.","Please now turn to Slide 9. On June 29, we filed an application with the South Carolina PSC requesting an increase in our retail electric rates. In this application, we requested an allowed ROE of 10.95% and additional revenue of $151.5 million. A significant portion of this increase is simply an extension of the previous rate case.","Out of this additional revenue, we anticipate approximately $50 million would impact net income as the balance offsets new cost that will also be reflected in the financials. For example, in the last case we agreed not to include in rates. Operating expenses is associated with the scrubber at Wateree station, as it was not yet in service. Instead, those costs were deferred. A portion of this case seeks recovery of that deferral prospectively.","Additionally, we deferred increase pension cost related to the decline in market value of the related assets after the financial crises. The remainder of the increase will offset expenses such as depreciation and property taxes.","In our application, we asked that the new rates become effective on January 1, 2013. A hearing is scheduled for November, and we anticipate receiving an order from the commission by the end of December.","Slide 10, presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast is identical to the one we shared with you at our June Analyst Day events and reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA filing in May.","Please turn to Slide 11. We have successfully completed all of our planned debt financings for 2012. The remainder of this slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and has not changed since our Analyst Day event. We continue to anticipate drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward during the first quarter of 2013.","Now, please turn to Slide 12. We are affirming our earnings guidance of $3.05 to $3.25 per share. The long-term outlook is unchanged as we plan to deliver 3% to 5% earnings growth over the three to five year period, based on the 2010 weather normalized base of $2.92 per share.","Our guidance encompasses the impact of whether on our Georgia operations during the first quarter, the impact of higher operating and maintenance expenses, and base rate increases for our new nuclear filings under the BLRA and Gas RSA adjustments. Our effective tax rate for 2011 was just over 30%, and we estimate the rate for 2012 will be approximately 31%.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. We are pleased that our construction continues to move forward on our nuclear project. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates of March of 2017 for Unit 2 and May of 2018 for Unit 3.","We have made progress on several areas during the past quarter. We continue to pour concrete in the Unit 2 excavation site. Making progress on the switchyard and cooling towers. The heavy lift derrick has been assembled, tested and is ready for use. Large component manufacture is progressing at sites around the world. And Slide 14 shows two of those components at a facility in South Korea.","Parts continue to arrive at the Port Charleston, before being transported to the site. We have made extensive progress on the turbine island for Unit 2, the first new unit, as you can see it on Slide number 15.","You can also see a portion of the heavy lift derrick, which is the blue arm across the top of the picture. The derrick is located between the excavation sites for the two new units. This will allow it to be used to lift assembled modules and other heavy components, and place them in the excavation site for either unit.","Circulating water pipe is in place, as shown in the center of the page. Slide also shows the containment vessel lower bowl. Chicago Bridge & Iron has completed welding of the lower bowl, and is now welding the first ring section for that containment vessel, which is shown on Slide number 16.","Slide 17, shows 230,000 volt transmission lines being connected to the switchyard, which is nearing completion. The construction is on scheduled to allow the switchyard to be energized in the first half of 2013. This will allow us to back feed the project with power from the grid.","A final hearing for signing of transmission lines related to the new nuclear project will be held on August 22. We were fortunate to be able to use existing rights-of-way for the vast majority of transmission lines from the new units.","Please turn now to Slide 18, which shows the nuclear island for Unit 2. Over the last few months, we have poured dental and leveling concrete using our on-site concrete batch plants. This process has done well even while incurring record high temperatures. We had anticipated the challenge of high temperatures and we're able to ship to schedules to allow the pours to be done in the evening, when temperatures are not as extreme.","We have also begun installation of the waterproof membrane in the nuclear island. After that is complete, more high-strength concrete called mud mat is poured prior to installing the nuclear island rebar cage. As of yesterday, we installed the waterproof membrane and mud mat for about 75% of the nuclear island and placed about 40% of the rebar cage.","I know many of you have been interested on our rebar cage. I will let you know that we are constructing our rebar cage to conform to the applicable concrete code and design certification document requirements. And do not anticipate any additional delays to the rebar cage.","Once the rebar cage is fully in place, we'll pour the six-foot thick nuclear island base mat and then set module CR10 on the base mat. The CR10 module is currently being fabricated on site, so that it will be ready when needed.","CR10 is a steel-frame support used to hold the lower bowl above the base mat until the foundation concrete is completed. We anticipate setting the lower containment bowl later this year. In summary, the construction is progressing well and on track to achieve the amended completion dates.","Please turn now to Slide 19. As you may remember, in May we filed an application with the South Carolina Public Service Commission seeking to update our budget and schedule. A new schedule sets the substantial completion dates for the units at March of 2017 and May of 2018.","The updated costs totaled $283 million and were primarily the result of delays in receipt of our license and agreement with Shawn Westinghouse related to challenge cost for the construction of our new nuclear units, and additional owners cost or non-EPC costs for which we were responsible, such as staffing, information technology and facilities.","The hearing on our updated cost filing will be held in September. We anticipate receiving an order from the commission on these items in mid-November.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We'll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar Securities.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities","Just wondering what the SCE&G rate case, what do you think the risk is there of a potential ROE cut given or interest rates have moved obviously? Any indications from anywhere either other utilities or other comments from the regulatory staff that could possibly lead to an ROE cut?","Jimmy Addison","Well, let me first kind of define where we are. Of course, we filed the case as we say here at 10.95. Our current rates are based on 10.7. The only other benchmark that we really have is the most recent case from Duke Energy, which I believe was completed last fall that was at 10.5.","So that's kind of the range of the numbers that we have today. And just to give you some perspective on the 10.95 compared to the 10.7, that's obviously 25 basis points. That's about $10 million per 25 basis points.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Securities","And one follow-up. Do you think there is any risk of rate fatigue in there? You've gotten obviously the nuclear rate increases now this is for the second time in a couple of years and you've had a pretty sizeable base rate increase. Did you get any indications of potential customer rate?","Jimmy Addison","Well, a couple of comments on that. First of all, we've taken a fairly unusual step of offering a field decrease simultaneous with this rate increase that would offset roughly a third or more of the cost of it to the customer. So we're trying to create a situation where we earn a reasonable return for investors to continue to attract the capital that we need to continue the development of the nuclear, while at the same time appreciating the condition of customers and trying to keep their bill down.","After that reduction you've got an overall average increase of 3.5%, 3.75%, and that's after two years. So that's pretty close to the rate of inflation we experienced over the last couple of years. And having said that, we're very aware that we continue to have the increases under the Base Load Review Act for the nuclear development and we have worked very hard to mitigate this increase and will work very hard to stay away as long as we can in the future.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jay Dobson of Wunderlich Securities.","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","Steve, just a question on the agreement between and Shawn and Chicago Bridge & Iron to merge, just sort of practical implications from your roles perspective?","Steve Byrne","We don't see any implications to our project from the proposed merger. So if it goes forward, we're aware of the fact that CB&I management team will take over. And we understand Jim Bernhard will be retiring. We have experience with Chicago Bridge & Iron.","As you probably heard a few minutes ago, they are doing welding on our site for the containment vessel. They are going to be on the site for another couple of years, while they complete the ring sections.","And if you go back in time, they actually manufactured the reactor vessel for our V.C. Summer Unit number 1. So we've got a long history with CB&I. So we think that it would be a good move. We don't see any implications at the site to the merger.","Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities","And then, Jimmy, on retail sales, if you can just give us a little more clarity. I sensed a bit of optimism may be too strong of a word, but a little bit of glimmer of hope that maybe things could be improving. And I'm really thinking to start out into 2013 and I think a lot of us have thought maybe it would be flat. Is there any hope with what you are seeing right now that trends are improving, that we could see things start to improve from a retail sales perspective out in '13?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I think that's a real fair characterization. And that's why we offered this additional chart on Page 7 in the slides to show the kind of consistent trend over the last three quarters in customer growth. So I am encouraged by this, it's just been so erratic over the last couple of years and it has continued even into the first six months.","To be more specific, out of the six months this year, three months sales have increased on a weather normal basis and three months they've been slightly lower. Now, net overall the increases have been larger, but there has just been some variability and that is just too early to say there is a real definitive linear trend.","One thing that we have noticed lately though is that, go back to a year ago and our overall growth rate in the electric business was about 0.5%. And the growth in commercial customers was less than half of that, which wouldn't surprise you in the recession.","The industrials led the way out, residentials have started to follow behind. And I have commented for a few quarters now that the commercials have lagged. So they were about half the growth of residential. But if you look at the same numbers today, where our overall growth rate is about 0.8% on Page 7, the commercials are well in excess of that over 1%. So that's a really interesting sign.","Now, you'll notice in our overall commercial sales were relatively flat to last year. So the analysis of that I'd take is that, all the commercial customers are being very frugal in this difficult economy. But more coming online and I'm encouraged by that, continue to be encouragement by the industrial announcements we've focused on over the past year. But I really liked it, the middle market starting to come back some.","Operator","Our next question will comes from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Can you just give an update from the BLRA increase that you agreeing at last November or that readiness in the rates last November? How much of it have you taken to date? What's left to be taken between now and the next BLRA increase?","Jimmy Addison","On a dollar basis?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Yes, please?","Jimmy Addison","Michael, I don't know if I have that at my figure tips. The increase overall was about, let's say about $52 million. And then to effect in November, of course we've got six months of that under our belt. I just don't pro rate know how to tell you how much of that is in there because of the cyclical nature of the business. I haven't given enough like that.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Can I just kind of use back, for 52 million and it is mid-November to mid-November kind of assume $7 million, $7.5 million, $8 million a month and then kind of pro rate at that way or is it much more seasonal and cyclical based on the demand cycle?","Jimmy Addison","It is definitely based on the unit sales. So it definitely varies based upon unit sales. That's certainly something we can provide you in the future. I've just not been asked it in the past, so I don't have it at my finger tips.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And finally, O&M. One of things you mentioned when talking about guidance, the slight increase in O&M. You guys have been one of the better utilities about keeping O&M really low. Just curious are you seeing O&M pressures that you haven't seen in the last couple of years or is this a little bit of O&M catch-up going on?","Jimmy Addison","Not really broadly, Michael. It is really been isolated to kind of three categories. And I have mentioned those in my comments a few minutes ago, but just to expand upon it a little bit. We had some small increase in planned expenses at some of the generating plants.","Healthcare has trended up. We've been very effective the last four or five years through the end of 2011, in holding healthcare cost much lower than national averages, but we've seen a bump this year. We're hopeful that that's going to moderate for the balance of the year based upon some of the very recent data.","And then finally, the main driver is really more of, last year was lower than a normal period would have been. And let me explain that, and that's really driven by coming out of Fukushima issue last year and thus lowering our long-term earnings guidance from 4% to 6% to 3% to 5%. Our stock took quite a hit. And as a result, all of our incentive comp plans that are equity based, we didn't hit any of those targets.","So those two actions I just described happened in or near the end of the Q1, and all of that impact was in those plans by the end of Q2. So we were hitting none of those targets and accruing none of that cost related to those benefit plans.","On the contrary, this year you're well aware our stocks performed very well compared to the peers, and we're getting some of that bounce back effect. So last year we were accruing none of that cost. This year we're slightly above our 100% targets, because of the bounce back. So it's kind of going in opposite directions.","Michael Lapides; Goldman Sachs","Last question, just when I look at the slide about the rate case. Which of those items in that box had about $151 million? You mentioned the environmental deferral around the OpEx for the scrubber, you mentioned the pension. Which are the other ones are more forward-looking, they weren't part of the historical test here?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I think most of the others are forward-looking. In other words, I think you nailed it too that were really part of the prior case. So the others really are things that have occurred, since then property taxes have increased.","We've got the announcement of the retirement of the generating plants. We've made additional investments into for reliability some of it mandated, some of it our judgment that needed to be made, and then depreciations increased. So those other categories are all after the last case.","Michael Lapides; Goldman Sachs","But these are as of the test year. These aren't looking forward as a forecast to 2013?","Jimmy Addison","No, exactly right. These are all historical test year. Only thing we do is just annualize everything up. As of the end of the test year, we annualize it at that point.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Paltz of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just had a few questions on, first, can you just remind me the kilowatt sales growth that is embedded in your long-term EPS growth?","Jimmy Addison","Actually I might hand that off to Steve, because that's really driven by IRP. Do you have in memory, Steve, what the long-term growth is there?","Steve Byrne","I don't have the kilowatt hour growth, but we're looking somewhere in the 1% range.","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So that net customer and usage growth?","Steve Byrne","That would be the net kilowatt hour sales growth.","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then, Jimmy, regarding your comments on the expected rate relief assuming you got what you requested, did you say the $50 million would be margin improvement or net income?","Steve Byrne","Net income. I'm sorry, David, that's pre-tax.","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just taking a bigger picture, I know you just filed this current electric rate case, but do you expect to continue your historic rate case cycle, I guess is what two to three years?","Jimmy Addison","It has been typically two to three years and that's been really something that in direction we received from the commission several years ago, about coming more frequently for smaller cases. Having said that, we've got three significant years of construction in front of us with the nuclear plant, and we're going to do everything within management's control to try to mitigate increases during that period.","We're hopeful that we get a reasonable return out of this case, it doesn't push us back in there in the near term. And that we can stay out longer because our goal would be able to stay out in the majority of that three year peak period, while we go through the heavy construction.","David Paltz - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just one last question, when do you plan to introduce 2013 guidance and address your long-term growth rate?","Jimmy Addison","Possibly at the Q3 call, David. But we'll kind of wait and see how the economy is going as well as obviously the other big if is what we were just discussing in this rate case. So if we're well along the way or have something in a settlement around the rate case even though it would not be approved by the commissions at that point, that would give us more confidence and we would lean towards announcing then. If not, we may hold off until the yearend call.","And back to your earlier question, one other thought is, I think really part of the solution and that all of us hope for I am sure, and really being able to stay out longer is if the economy really starts coming back. If some of these early trends really do develop, that can help fund part of the need for additional capital for new services, new lines etcetera. And we're hopeful that will help to extend that period before we would have to go out and contribute additional return.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Hanson of Presidus.","John Hanson - Presidus","How about an update as to situation with Santee and their options, and how that's all going with some of the folks there in the regions as we say?","Jimmy Addison","Santee, as you're aware is looking to divest itself with some of their ownership percentage. Currently, they are 45% owner in the project. They still are committed to nuclear and want to be an owner. They just want to own a little less than 45%.","They currently are, as we understand it, in negotiations with three entities, the one that gets most of the headlines in this area is Duke. So they are in negotiations with Duke to sell a portion of it, and as you're aware they've signed some letters of intent that should lead to ownership percentages. But they're also still pursuing a deal with AMP and with South Mississippi.","John Hanson - Presidus","The AMP is in Ohio, right?","Jimmy Addison","That's correct.","John Hanson - Presidus","And then they did have one with one of the Florida munis and something that that didn't has evolved or didn't pan out. I didn't see them on your list that you had at your Analyst Day, Steve?","Steve Byrne","I think if you go back to a couple of years, they did have two entities in Florida, and I believe they are both public power entities in Florida, that have since dropped off their list, and that's when they picked up the new public power entities of South Mississippi and AMP.","John Hanson - Presidus","What do you feel for the new Duke in terms of what they may think about this?","Jimmy Addison","So far SCE&G has not been involved in any negotiations with the new Duke. So I don't know how the new Duke will feel about it, but we don't have any reason to believe they're going to feel any differently about it than the folks who we were dealing with before.","And our understanding is that the people that we will be dealing with are the same folks that we had dealt with previously in these discussions. So since Santee has not let us known any changes in negotiation strategy, because of course the merger is not complete.","John Hanson - Presidus","Do they have any deadlines at all or not?","Jimmy Addison","I think in some of their letters of intent, they do have some deadlines. But, again this Santee's sale and it's there to piece to unload. So I am not aware of what those deadlines are at the top of my head.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ashar Khan of Visium.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Jimmy, I'm just trying to give some assumptions based on the data that you've provided and some based on the results, so if you can just bear with me.","First of all, is the earnings improvement coming this year, is all because of the electric nuclear stuff, and are you losing ROE on the non-nuclear stuff. Is that a fair point or no?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I think certainly there is margin from the new nuclear, but there is margin from the Rate Stabilization Act at the LDC in South Carolina. There is increased margin from growth in the North Carolina customer base. So I don't think you can say it's all from nuclear. But I'd say in the second quarter a substantial amount was driven by this bump in the economy that we discussed a few questions ago and that contributed to this Q2 growth.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Well, what I referring to was this chart that you have, I guess, on Page 8, which gives the 7.26% ROE, if I'm right? It is based as of March 31, 2012.","Jimmy Addison","Right.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Based on your objective of the $3.17, which is your internal target for the year. We expect that nuclear is going to be at 11% because that's what's granted and everything. Where will you end up this year based on that target on the non-nuclear with the 7.26? Where should we be looking for that number for 2012 based on the $3.17 guidance internal target?","Jimmy Addison","First of all, let me try to clear something up. First, the 7.26 is not our actual earned return, as I have attempted to really give some examples in my prepared comments earlier.","7.26 is the pro forma return at the end of the test year. So what we've done at the end of the test year is take all known and measurable cost that are there at the end of the year. For example, if we began depreciating a large piece of equipment in the twelfth month, we only have one-twelfth of the cost in that test year, so when the pro forma at end we will include the other 11 months, and that will drop the return down.","Ashar Khan - Visium","But what would this number be if you had all this year's earnings, and even if this was like pro forma for 12\/31\/2012?","Steve Byrne","Well, that's where I would say that the number we gave you at the end of Q1 was 8.86%, that's not changed a great deal as of today. And I don't know of anything that's going to change it to great deal between now and the end of the year.","So we're earning in that 8.75% to 9% range at this point, unless you pro forma in this full year cost. So eventually it's going to drift all the way down to the 7.26, once you get full years of those additional pro forma costs. But I would say now it's somewhere in the 8.5 range.","So the process in South Carolina requires that you don't file the interim surveillance reports after you file the rate case, you simply file the rate case with all of your pro formas and you don't file any interim reports in the meantime, until the case is resolved.","Ashar Khan - Visium","Jimmy, what I was trying to do and I don't know if you can help me assume and these are all assumptions. So just wanted to see how I'm trying to do next year's earnings. If say you get a 10% and you're able to earn a 10% ROE, this is my assumption, theoretically for a conversation basis. If you are able to earn a 10% ROE in 2013, the next year, will the delta be from the 7.26 to going to go into 10 or will the delta be from the 8.75 going to 10?","Jimmy Addison","Depends upon when you measure that. If you measured it at the end of the first quarter it'd be 8.86. If you measured it at the end of the year and the commission agreed with all of our pro formas, it would be 7.26.","So I understand what you're trying to accomplish. I think the only way I can really respond is to say that we've provided our guidance. We reaffirmed that today. So we've given you our internal target and our long term growth rates. And we think those are all reasonable, and if you want to make some sensitivity adjustments off that that's also why I provided the 100 basis points of ROE is about $40 million. So if you wanted to make some adjustments.","Ashar Khan - Visium","So if I am using that next year you should be able to improve like 200 basis points that would be that you are earning more like 9.26 next year on an ROE basis, on a pro forma basis in '13, right? So that's really one should use as a base, is the 7.26 for 2012?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, but it's not that simple, because it really depends upon on what conclusion the ORS and the commission comes to as it relates to the various pro formas we've included.","So for example, we have proposed certain amortization periods on this pension costs. Well, they may decide on different amortization periods. And so that would change the expense and maybe stretch it out over a longer period of time. So I'm not trying to be evasive, but it's just almost impossible for me to answer.","Ashar Khan - Visium","But that would of course not allow you to run from your allowed ROE of 10% rate if you drag things down, right? Whatever they don't do or whatever the number you get, you've asked for a higher number, and whatever that give you. And then there could be other stuff, which might not allow you to earn the allowed ROE as part of it right? That's what you are saying, right?","Jimmy Addison","Well, yes and no. As it relates to ROE, if there is a lower number that's going to impact our earnings for sure. If it relates to an expense item and they determine that it should be amortized over a longer period, and the expense will go down and the requested income will go down by a commensurate amount. So we would have no impact on net income or earned return.","Ashar Khan - Visium","But just to end up, Jimmy, because as you said, you won't be filing rate cases every year. I guess the year where you get a rate case decision, earnings should be much higher and then they leveragize, because you're not filing any increases for a year or so. Right? So there would like bumps in earnings, and I know you're going to offset it somewhat with the share increase coming in, but one can assume that earnings should be increasing on in a more percentage basis in a year where there is a rate increase. Is that that fair to assume?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, there is always a lumpiness in our business, because of the need for rate increases in just certain periods, but there are contributors. A lot of our growth is driven off, the BLRA is driven off of the contribution from the other gas businesses, and that's going to come back to how well the economy grows there too.","Operator","I am showing no additional questions in the queue. I would like to turn the call back to Jimmy Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Thank you. To summarize, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. Weather normalized mechanisms continue to mitigate the impacts of weather on our margins, and construction of our nuclear project continues to move forward.","We'll certainly be focused on our regulatory proceedings during the balance of the year, and we'll update you as these matters progress. We thank you for joining us today, and for your interest in SCANA.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today's presentation.

I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, April 25, 2013. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the first quarter of 2013. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and economic development in our service territory. Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at SCANA.com.","Before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Byron, and thank you, all, for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the first quarter of 2013 were $1.13 per share compared to $0.93 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher electric and gas margins were primarily offset by increases in CapEx-related costs, such as depreciation, property taxes, interest expense and share dilution. Our results during the first quarter of 2013 were slightly better than our forecast, due primarily to timing of O&M expenses.","As we projected in our February call, we took down the 6.6 million shares under our equity forward during March. For the remainder of the year, we expect comparable basic earnings per share to moderate due to the related dilution.","Now on Slide 4, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's first quarter 2013 earnings, denoted in blue, were up $0.13 compared to 2012, driven largely by base rate increases along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in interest and depreciation expenses, and share dilution.","PSNC Energy's earnings for the first quarter 2013, shown in red, were $0.24 per share and consistent with the first quarter of 2012. Increases in margin due to customer growth were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses and depreciation expenses.","SCANA Energy, the company's retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia, reported first quarter 2013 earnings of $0.16 per share compared to $0.09 per share in the first quarter of 2012. The increase is primarily attributable to a return to normal weather.","SCANA's corporate and other businesses, which include Carolina Gas Transmission, SCANA Communications, ServiceCare, SCANA Energy Marketing and the holding company, reported earnings of $0.05 per share, consistent with the first quarter of 2012.","Next, I would like to touch on sales growth, as shown on Slide 5. We continue to see growth in weather-normalized sales volumes. For the 12 months ended March 31, 2013, total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 2.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 0.9%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire, as we've discussed in prior quarters.","As we have mentioned previously, we evaluate weather-normalized sales on a 12-month rolling basis in order to capture an entire business cycle. Because of this, the impact of the fire is reflected in our industrial volumes. Excluding the impact of the fire, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 0.5%, while total weather-normalized retail sales would have increased approximately 1.4%.","On the bottom left-hand side of the slide, you will find the information about economic trends in our service territories. We continue to be encouraged by the level of economic development activity, with approximately $1.1 billion announced investment and over 2,600 jobs in our Carolinas territories this year. A significant portion of these investments and jobs are due to a recent announcement by Boeing Corporation that plans to invest another $1 billion and add at least 2,000 more jobs at its North Charleston campus.","Our electric customer base grew at a rate of 0.8% this past quarter, continuing to show stable growth. Growth at our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina continues to be strong. As of March 2013, those rates were 1.8% for SCE&G gas and 2.2% for PSNC. PSNC had its best growth rate since 2008. PSNC also hit a milestone this quarter, as they exceeded 500,000 customers.","Slide 6 presents our CapEx forecast, which has not changed since our previous earnings call. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending, as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed on February 13, and reflects our new CapEx budget for 2013 through 2015.","Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated. As you can see from the slide, we're beginning to enter a period of nuke -- peak nuclear spending.","Please turn to Slide 7 to review our financing plan. This slide presents our estimated financing plan through 2017, and is also consistent with the forecast on our last call. As I mentioned, we settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March. We don't anticipate any additional equity issuances for the balance of 2013, other than through our 401(k) and dividend reinvestment plans. We continue to anticipate new First Mortgage Bond issuances to support new nuclear construction later in the year.","Please turn to Slide 8. We are reaffirming our earnings guidance of $3.25 to $3.45 basic earnings per share, along with our internal target of $3.35 per share. Our long-term outlook remains unchanged, as we plan to deliver 3% to 6% earnings growth over the 3- to 5-year period, based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy, and let me start by addressing an issue we have been dealing with since last year, but has gained notoriety in the past few days based on a press release issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Monday. SCE&G has requested a regulatory conference with the NRC, based on the NRC's preliminary categorization of a finding during a construction inspection. The NRC assigned a color coding -- sorry, the NRC assigns a color coding to findings based on their determination of safety significance. The range of colors is green, white, yellow and red, with green being the least significant. A green finding is defined as one of having very low safety significance. In this instance, we were preliminary issued a white finding, the next lowest level, which indicates a low to moderate safety significance. We have not previously received a finding of greater than green on a construction, and we believe that this one should also be green, which is why we requested the conference.","This is not a new issue, having first been raised last September, and we have discussed it on previous earnings calls. It deals with shear reinforcement spacing and the use of T-heads in the concrete basemat. We corrected the problem prior to pouring the basemat, which was completed on March 11, and no additional work on the basemat will be needed, regardless of the outcome of this conference.","In addition, we identified a similar condition that exists in other wall sections of the nuclear island. We are submitting license amendment requests, or LARs, to document the change and gain NRC approval, and we expect to receive those LARs shortly. And we'll then be able to begin pouring these wall sections. We continue to anticipate that Unit 2 will become operational in 2017 and Unit 3 in 2018.","I would now like to direct your attention to Slide 9. As I mentioned previously, in March, we completed the placement of the nuclear island basemat, sometimes referred to as first nuclear concrete, or FNC. That event marked the first new such construction of nuclear concrete to be poured in the United States in 3 decades. Basemat provides a foundation for the containment building, shield building and auxilliary building that make up the nuclear island. Measuring 6 feet in thickness, the basemat covered a surface totaling 32,000 square feet, and it took just over 50 hours of continuous pouring to complete. We're very pleased with the collaborative efforts of our partners in making this concrete pour a success.","Please turn now to Slide 10. At the beginning of April, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the Unit 2 basemat. This module had been previously assembled on-site and was lifted into place using the heavy lift derrick. CR-10 supports the containment vessel. One of the next steps for Unit 2 will be to set the containment vessel bottom head in the CR-10 module. The bottom head has also been previously assembled on-site.","On the top left of Slide 11, you can see a picture of the switchyard. The switchyard was energized and turned over to SCE&G in January of this year. This gives us the ability to back feed to the 2 new nuclear plants to perform testing when the time comes. At the top right of that same slide, you will see a picture of cooling tower 2 Alpha. Progress on all 4 low-profile forced-draft cooling towers continues to progress as anticipated.","On the bottom left, you will see the Unit 2 turbine building. The basemat for the Unit 2 turbine building is complete and the forming and pouring of the walls has begun. At bottom right, you will see a picture of the Unit 3 nuclear island. Leveling concrete has been poured and the lower mud mat is complete. Installation of the waterproof membrane in the upper mud mat will be completed in the coming months, and the basemat will follow. Again, the schedule continues to support commercial operation dates in 2017 for Unit 2 and 2018 for Unit 3.","As you can see on Slide 12, we have 2 Base Load Review Act, or BLRA filings coming up in May. Around mid-May, we will file our quarterly status update with the Public Service Commission. And on May 30th, we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA. Both of these filings will be made available for review in the Investor Relations section of SCANA.com","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Travis Miller with MorningStar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wondering if you can walk through some of the cost implications that might be related to the NRC finding, the meeting, anything related to that, potentially?","Stephen A. Byrne","Travis, this is Steve Byrne. At this point in time, we are still hopeful that we will be able to make our case that this is a lower safety significant item than the NRC, perhaps, preliminary thought it was. And that -- if that's the case, we won't see any changes to the cost of the project based on this. Really, when you look at the significance determination process that the NRC goes through in categorizing these findings, even if it were to be categorized as a white finding, what that would mean for us is increased inspection. And of course, I don't know at this point how much increased inspection. That really becomes a burden on our staff, the cost of which would be difficult to quantify. But there is no direct correlation to say that if you get a finding, it's going to cost you x, because we would not anticipate a fine from this. So from a cost point of view, we don't think it's going to be material.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that relates to the capital investment, potentially, or CapEx. Also, you won't expect to see much impact on that side?","Stephen A. Byrne","That's correct, we would not.","Operator","Your next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Moseh Yang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is Moseh for Julien. Just a quick question on retail. Any chance if you guys could give us an update on your outlook and expectations for retail in Georgia prospectively?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. It really hasn't changed since what we guided at the year-end call in February. So we expect that business, on a normal weather basis, to be about $0.18 to $0.20 a share in earnings for 2013. And the first quarter of 2013 was normal. It's just that the first quarter of '12 as compared to was so abnormal, almost 50% below in heating degree days. So we're right on track so far.","Moseh Yang - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And just going back to nuclear for a second. Just kind of help us understand how this safety violation kind of differs from Southern's rebar issue?","Stephen A. Byrne","It's the same issue. The rebar issue that they had at Southern initially was the same issue that we had. And in fact, it came up at our plant. So when we talk about the rebar issue for the basemat, this is the same issue. And again, it was corrected prior to us pouring the basemat, and the same thing would be the case for Southern, corrected prior to them pouring their basemat. So there's no impact to the basemat from this violation.","Operator","Your next question is from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","I wondered if I could ask you to review again, you said you need to file another license amendment request for the walls. I wondered if you could just go through that again.","Stephen A. Byrne","Sure. Similar to the way we handled the basemat, we filed a license amendment request to handle the changes that we wanted to make to the basemat. And if you remember that issue probably from our last earnings call, we did some physical changes to the reinforcing bar in the basemat, and we also changed the applicable code section from the concrete code, from one section to another. So for the wall section, we're going to do the same thing. So we'll change the reference from ACI 349 to ACI 318, and then we'll do some physical changes to the reinforcing bar itself. Now those -- for the lower levels, the critical sections, the ones that we're going to need next, we have already submitted that license amendment request to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and expect approval of that relatively soon. And we think that, more than likely, there will be other license amendment requests for the upper levels, these will be levels that obviously we won't be needing for some time, in the months or years to come.","Leslie Rich - J.P. Morgan Asset Management, Inc.","So I guess this license amendment request process, is it getting a little bit more streamlined? And when the first one was filed, it was sort of potentially a big deal. Now is it just more, \"Oh, we have a change here, we have a change there?\" It's not likely to be hung up at the NRC for any extended period of time?","Stephen A. Byrne","Leslie, I think as with everything else, the more often you do it on our side and on the regulator side, they become more efficient at handling and processing them, so I do expect some efficiencies to be gained there. But to their credit, even with the basemat license amendment requests and preliminary approval request that we submitted, the NRC did exactly what they said that they would do and pretty well followed their timeline. So we have no complaints about how expeditiously they processed those changes, and we would anticipate similar handling of these changes.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just some nuts and bolts questions. First of all, O&M was basically flat on a year-over-year basis. Just curious, because when you -- in some of your prior slides from last year, you outlined some of the pressures, like pension, like environmental cost, that were embedded in the rate case, but would also create upward movement in O&M. It didn't look like that flowed through. Just kind of would love your thoughts on what happened there.","Jimmy E. Addison","Sure. Those costs did flow through. The reason they might not appear on the surface is they were offset by other kind of reductions. We had 2 or 3 things going on in the first quarter that will relate to, what we call, internally timing. They're going to show up later in the year rather than in the first quarter when we initially expected, and let me give you a couple of examples. We had some really -- we had a really mild January, and we had a really wet and cold February and March. Overall, it was statistically normal. So for example, the Georgia business ended up, like I said earlier, with normal weather. However, with very mild weather in January and the colder weather at the end of the quarter, we really didn't see the same level of bad debts or write-offs that we had expected in Q1. A lot of those bills are just showing up in April and May to the customers. So we expect there may be a couple of cents of that, that trickles over into Q2. We didn't have any significant storms that would require us to hit our storm deductible, which is $2.5 million a year, before we go against our storm reserve. We didn't hit any of that, but we had hit some of it in the past comparative quarter. We were lower than expected on our vegetation management, our tree trimming in Q1, because of that wet weather prevented the guys from being out there and executing on some of those plans. So those were some of the things that were really netting and offsetting those costs that are there, that we discussed earlier.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so when we think about what's embedded in your 2013 guidance, what should we assume kind of year-over-year O&M growth?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, well, as we discussed a couple of months ago on the year-end call, I said, overall, we expected to be in the close to 5% range. And about half of that is driven by amortized costs that are coming out of the rate case order, pension costs, those kinds of things. So on the net, at this point, I really see it maybe being slightly less than that, maybe 4% to 4.5%, but not significantly less. I think it will still show up in the full overall period.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So a little bit more back-end loaded rather than kind of spread? Like we were assuming it was just kind of spread evenly throughout the quarters.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. And frankly, we presumed some of that in our plan too, but we can't tell in advance what the weather's going to be and the rain's going to be and the storms. That's reality.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One follow-on, just trying to get a feel for how much of the rate increases that were granted at SCE&G going into 2013, really just the core base rate, not the nuclear. How much of that has already been incurred that you benefited from versus what's left over to take rest of the year?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, it started January 1, so we've got a full quarter in there. And I don't know the exact cyclical breakdown of it. But net of those related costs, you and I were discussing earlier, it's probably $0.02 to $0.03 earnings contribution in Q1, net of those costs. But I don't really have the revenue breakdown on a cyclical basis.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And finally just from a reporting perspective, how do you all allocate the holding company debt when you show your segment EPS?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, that's really rolled up in the holdco and others in that category, that's not broken out in any of the separating opcos. So it remains in there netted with the others.","Operator","Your next question is from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Steve, you mentioned that you're still on track for 2017 and '18 for the new nuclear units. Is that still March and May, respectively?","Stephen A. Byrne","Jonathan, we haven't had any changes to the in-service dates that we last took to our commission. Now with the Base Load Review Act order, we do have some schedule flexibility, and so it's 18 months before we would have to go back and say we were not on schedule. So as of this point in time, I don't have any information to say that we're going to be outside of the specific dates that we have in our last order, which you just mentioned, March and May.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, Jimmy, on the trailing 12-months weather-normalized retail sales growth of 1.4%, the adjusted amount, is that net of the energy efficiency efforts? I'm just kind of wondering since I believe your 2013 guidance embeds only 0.5% usage growth for the whole year.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, we're using 12 months rolling, so that's including 3 quarters from 2012 and the first quarter of '13. We try to do that, just take out some of the -- to get a full cycle in there. And I think what you were talking about, our plan for '13 obviously excludes those prior periods in 2012.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Right. But is the 1.4%, is that net of energy efficiency efforts? Because I know you're kind of indicating the 0.5% for 2013 reflected a headwind from some efficiency efforts, in particular, kind of CFL bulb adoption and stuff like that.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, net, we expect to be somewhere around 0.5% or slightly less overall retail growth.","Jonathan Reeder - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Does that mean -- I guess you feel pretty comfortable that, that's on the conservative side, if anything right now, based on how Q1 shaped up?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, I wouldn't really say that. I'd say I feel like it's pretty accurate at this point. I wouldn't characterize it as conservative or aggressive either way.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question is from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","Going to your Slide 6 on the CapEx, I was wondering if you could update what you've spent in the first quarter?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, Dan, I really don't -- I don't have that handy with me here now. But on the general part of the business other than generation, which tends to be projects and when we do those in the shoulder months, so either the spring or the fall, generally, the others is going to flow fairly ratably throughout the year. And the new nuclear, Steve, I don't know if you have any comments to characterize?","Stephen A. Byrne","I don't yet have the first quarter update.","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, we really don't have that. I'm sorry.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And I was curious on the prior Slide 5, if you had -- could give any color? You talked a little bit about, on the industrial, what the impact for the customer with the fire. But have you seen any change in trend among the industrial classes, is that improving or about the same or any color related to that?","Jimmy E. Addison","It's really a case-by-case deal. In fact, I was looking over those a couple of days ago at our top 30 or 40 customers, and it's kind of a hodgepodge. There's not any one certain trend or it's not like all are flat, like the average is. As you might imagine, there's some volatility on both sides of that. Somewhat sector specific, there will be fits and starts with housing and chemicals and things of that nature, but nothing really stands out as a trend, Dan.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","You've already addressed most of them. Just a bookkeeping one, what was the basic and diluted share count ending the quarter, after the equity floor was drawn?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Page 4 of the press release, right at the bottom of that page, you can get those. So basic, it was 134.4 million; diluted, 136.1 million.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Wasn't that the average for the quarter? I'm asking the ending.","Jimmy E. Addison","If you're looking for an ending...","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Like what's going forward, what should we be assuming?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, you're going to -- we're going to put that in the 10-Q. It will be filed in another week or so. But the year-end number, we took down 6.6 million shares. So I mean the actual number outstanding is just slightly under 140 million, but it will take a full 12 months for that to average into the annual average for sure.","Operator","Your next question is from Tim Winter with Gabelli & Company.","Timothy M. Winter - Gabelli & Company, Inc.","I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about some of the puts and takes with the equity going forward, your stock's hitting an all-time high again today. And the forward, how did that work out for you and what are you thinking going forward?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, well, I might just refer those over, if you have the slides nearby to Page 7, so nothing has changed since the last call on this. We still estimate about $500 million of equity in addition to that, that would come through our K and dividend reinvestment plans, and that would cover the balance of the construction of the projects. We indicate that in kind of that blue hash box because it may or may not occur just like it's laid out there on the chart. The forward helped us a great deal in that we did the forward originally in the middle of 2010. We had expected to take it down in 6 to 9 months based on the planned construction schedule. Because of the bonus depreciation stimulus passed by Congress, because of some of the change in our tax strategies, we really didn't need that cash at that point, so we extended the forward twice. So on one hand, it's really worked out well that we avoided the basic dilution for close to 3 years. On the other hand, the market -- frankly, you guys have been about 50-50, some have included it in -- you picked up diluted, some have picked up basic. So it's kind of a hodgepodge. So it certainly helped our actual earnings per share on a basic basis. But it's been a little bit of a disappointment that it's just an odd animal, as I've discussed before, and about half the market has followed on the diluted basis. So I just see it really different than options or something like that, so it does have that drawback. How we do it going forward? We're going to continue to monitor this. The good news is we don't need any more for the balance of the year, other than what we would get through the plans, which is kind of pro rata each quarter. And we'll watch the market and see what's going on, watch the projected inflation with the project and the project schedule. And it's just too early to tell any more about when or how we'll do that.","Operator","Your next question is from Andy Levi with Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Actually, most of my questions were answered, but just a follow-up. I guess based on your comments, it's safe to kind of say that your opinion of a forward sale is not as favorable as it was since you've experienced the forward sale. Is that kind of what you're trying to say?","Jimmy E. Addison","I'm glad we did it. I wish it did not come with the baggage of the dilution associated with it. Because again, about half of the market has focused on the diluted and about half have focused on basic. I wish it were clear there. But no, if I had to do it over again, knowing everything we know now, it would still be the best option, because it gave us that flexibility for such a period of time.","Operator","[indiscernible] question is from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jimmy, real quick follow-up. Tax this year, how big of a difference do you expect between booked and GAAP in cash taxes? Or how impactful, how much do you expect in terms of cash flow related to bonus D&A?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, bonus D&A, we expect to be somewhere in the $70 million to $90 million range for 2013. And the effective tax rate, we projected at the beginning of the year and it's held through so far at about 32%. So I can't tell you exactly what the cash basis will be, but it will start ramping up here this year or so.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Meaning the $80 million of bonus D&A is basically the only major offset to book taxes you can imagine from a cash tax perspective?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, we've got one other one in that change in our tax strategy, the 263A, but it's not as significant as the bonus depreciation.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to now turn the conference back over to Mr. Jimmy Addison for any closing remarks.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, thank you, and thank you, all. To summarize, we're very pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2013. We remain on track to meet our target and have met several major milestones with our new nuclear project.

I know many of you are joining us on the call today not only to hear our financial results for 2016 but also to learn more about the status of Westinghouse and the impact of Toshiba\u2019s financial challenges on our new nuclear construction project. Obviously we have been following the updates from Toshiba very closely and we will have comments for you on today's call. However before we get into that discussion, Jimmy Addison, SCANA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer will provide you with an overview of our financial results for 2016 followed by Steve Byrne, SCE&G's Chief Operating Officer with an update on the construction of our new nuclear units. I will then conclude our prepared remarks with an update on Westinghouse and Toshiba before we move into our Q&A session.","I now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks Kevin and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Earnings in the fourth quarter of 2016 were $0.87 per share compared to $0.69 per share in the same quarter of 2015. Electric margins benefited from a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and favorable weather compared to the same quarter of last year. Results also improved due to increased gas margins primarily attributable to the implementation of rate increases at PSNC and SCE&G. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and CapEx related items including depreciation, interest and property taxes. At the bottom of the slide you will note that abnormal weather decreased electric margins by $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulting in a positive $0.06 per share impact to earnings quarter over quarter. Slide 4 shows earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $4.16 per share compared to $5.22 per share for 2015. The decline is mainly attributable to the net of tax gains on the sales of two subsidiaries in 2015. During 2016, electric margins were higher due primarily to a Base Load Review Act rate increase, customer growth and weather.","Gas margins were also higher due to customer growth and rate increases. These increases were partially offset by higher O&M and CapEx-related items including depreciation, interest and property taxes. Abnormal weather increased electric margins in both years accounting for $0.19 per share in 2016 and $0.08 per share in 2015 resulting in a favorable $0.11 per share impact to earnings year over year. Now on Slide 5, I\u2019d like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G grew significantly for the quarter and the year due primarily to increasing electric margins from continued recovery of financing costs through the BLRA, weather and customer growth. PSNC also saw increases for the quarter and the year due principally to customer growth and a rate increase in November of 2016. SCANA Energy\u2019s earnings grew due to more favorable weather in 2016 versus 2015. Ignoring the impact of the net of tax gains on the sales of two subsidiaries in 2015 and their respective foregone earnings, SCANA\u2019s corporate and other results were consistent with the prior year.","I would now like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. In 2016 companies announced plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. The Carolinas continued to be seen as a favorable business environment and we are pleased about the continuous growth in our service areas. At the bottom of this slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as December of 2016 and 2015. Over the course of 2016, South Carolina's unemployment rate has dropped a remarkable 1.2% from its level at the end of 2015 and it's currently at 4.3%. December of 2016 marked an all-time high for the number of South Carolinians employed and the number in the labor force. Additionally, the absolute number of unemployed is the lowest it's been since April of 2001. Of particular interest and attesting to our state strong economic growth, almost 70,000 or 3.3% more South Carolinians are working today than a year ago. The expansion of the labor force is evident of the confidence of some of the workforce to re-enter the market and the deposit migration to the state of South Carolina.","The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia continued to see stable unemployment rates of 5.1% and 5.4% respectively. At depicted on Slide 7, United Van Lines recently released its annual Mover Study for 2016 which tracks migration patterns state to state. For the fifth consecutive year, South Carolina was a Top Five state for inbound moving. According to the study approximately 40% of these moves were related to jobs. Additionally, North Carolina has been listed in the Top Ten for the last five years. This study corroborates the customer growth which we have been seeing in our service territories over the past few years. On Slide 8 we present customer growth and electric sales statistics. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.6%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina each added customers at a rate of 2.9%. As you can see the rates trended fairly consistently throughout the year. The bottom table outlines are actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were relatively flat on a 12-month ended basis as we had expected when we provided our 2016 guidance.","Now please look at - to Slide 9 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $11 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue approximately 86% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business in which we're allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The adjusted earned return for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016 in the base electric business continues to meet our stated goal of earning a return of 8% or higher. This mitigates the need for non-BLRA related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We continue to be pleased with the execution of our strategy. Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we were allowed an 11% return on equity under the Base Load Review Act for all annual requests for revised rates that were approved prior to 2016. The approval of our 2015 petition included a revision of disallowed ROE down to 10.5% for prospective request for revised rates which applied to the request that went into effect at the end of November 2016.","Under the terms of our most recent order, the allowed ROE for the new nuclear business will be 10.25% for all prospective request for revised rates. As a reminder, we're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% on our gas LDC in South Carolina. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ended March 31 falls outside a range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE we failed to adjust rates under the Rate Stabilization Act. As you will recall, in mid 2016, we received approval for an annual $4.1 million revenue increase that was affective in November of 2016. As you were also aware we received approval from the North Carolina Utilities Commission for an annual $19 million revenue increase at PSNC Energy. That increase was effective on November 1, 2016. Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect the company's CapEx projections through 2019. This forecast also reflects the estimate of new nuclear spending as derived using the construction milestone payment schedule approved by the dispute resolution board in December 2016. Although this information is the best available at this time it is unlikely that the timing of these expenditures will occur exactly as presented. At the bottom of the slide, we recap the estimated new CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are historically calculated.","As you are aware, earlier this week, Westinghouse shared revised in-service states with us of April 2020 and December 2020 for units two and three respectively. Westinghouse has told us that it would provide the complete integrated project schedule supporting these dates to us for review. The CapEx forecast on Slide 10 has not been updated to reflect the impact of this revised project schedule. We will update the financial community on these changes after our review and evaluation have been completed. Now please look to Slide 11 to review our estimated financing plan through 2019. This plan has been updated to reflect the estimated timing of expenditures inherent in the construction milestone payments schedule as well as the expected impact of the Section 174 income tax deductions which we discussed on the previous call. The expected cash flows related to Section 174 are presented in the table is top of the slide. These amounts reflect the total amount of state and federal taxes that would have been paid absent the 174 deduction treatment. As a reminder, since early 2015 we have used open market purchases instead of issuing new shares to fulfill the needs of our 401-K and drip plans.","We currently estimate that will not have incremental equity needs until 2018. Again, it is unlikely that these debt and equity issuances will occur in the exact amounts or timing as presented as they are subject to changing in our funding needs for the plan project expenses and may change based upon the actual achievement of construction milestones and after consideration of the new schedule information that we will be receiving from Westinghouse. I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance and related assumptions on Slide 12. Our 2017 GAAP adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance range is $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target is $4.25 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 35% of this amount in the first quarter due to the demand in our gas and electric businesses, approximately 15% in the second quarter and the remaining 50% being roughly split between the third and fourth quarters. In developing this status, we have included the impact of electric rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA, the recent gas rate increases at SCE&G and PSNC. The impact of the 174 income tax deductions and the related estimated decrement rider as well as our current views regarding electric average use and the economy. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier, but does not incorporate the new schedule information that we will be receiving from Westinghouse.","We forecast electric customer growth to be approximately 1.5% offsetting our assumption that customer average use of electricity will be lower in 2017. Therefore we anticipate overall weather normalized retail electric sales growth for 2017 to be relatively flat. We expect consolidated operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 4% higher in 2017 compared to 2016 actuals. However, due to an integrity management rider approved in the 2016 PSNC rate case and a pension expense rider at SCE&G only about 1% of this amount will not be offset by incremental margins when compared to 2016 total O&M. amount. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Additionally, we project an effective tax rate of approximately 31% for 2017. In addition to providing this 2017 guidance we also resetting the base year for our long-term GAAP adjusted weather-normalized annual growth guidance to 2016\u2019s GAAP adjusted weather-normalized EPS of $3.97 per share. So our new long-term GAAP adjusted weather-normalized annual growth guidance target is to deliver 4% to 6% growth over the next three to five years using this base 2016 GAAP adjusted weather-normal EPS of $3.97 per share. Hopefully this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2017 and beyond as you update your models.","Now please turn to Slide 13. Earlier today we announced an increase of $0.15 in our annual dividend rate for 2017 to $2.45 per share, a 6.5% increase which is consistent with our prior commitment to grow dividends generally consistently with long-term earnings growth. Our Board of Directors also approved an increase in the upper band of our payout ratio from 60% to 65%. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistently with earnings.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. At first like to know that Westinghouse no longer has any modules either structural or mechanical left at the CB&I Lake Charles facility. Everything has either been completed, moved to another fabricator or is being completed at the VC summer site. On a non- construction note, we now have 22 operators for the new units who have passed all portions of their Nuclear Regulatory Commission license exam, a process that takes several years. We anticipate having over 40 licensed operators prior to fuel load. Moving on to some activities at the new nuclear construction site. Slide 14 presents an aerial photo of the construction tabletop from December of 2016. I've labeled both units two and three as well as many other areas of the construction site to give you a general layout of the area. If you look closely in front of the Module Assembly Building which is labeled MAB you can see structural module CA01 attached to the heavy lift derrick or HLD. At the time of the photo we were preparing to place it in the unit three containment vessel.","Slide 15 presents a schematic view of the five large structural or CA modules that are located inside the containment vessel. We have placed all of the major CA modules for unit two. We have previously placed CA04. 05 for unit three and more recently placed CA01. We'll discuss that more shortly. I'm pleased to say that all sub-modules for the remaining unit three structural modules are on site. Slide 16 shows an aerial view of the unit two Nuclear Island and containment vessel. Looking down into the containment vessel, you can see the first ring section and most of the previously mentioned structural modules as well as the steam generator which was placed in January. Outside of the containment vessel, you can see exhilarating building module CA20 and the shield building which surrounds the containment vessel. At the top left of the slide, you can see the containment vessel ring 2 before it was placed on top of the first ring section last weekend.","Slide 17 shows pictures of placement of the first of two steam generators for unit two which took place last month. The steam generator weighs approximately 1.5 million pounds, measures 20 feet in diameter and that's more than eighty feet long. Steam generators transfer heat from the reactor to convert water into steam needed to spin the turbine. Slide 18 shows pictures of the placement of the containment vessel ring two for unit two which as I previously mentioned was placed this past Saturday. This component was fabricated on site and is approximately 50 foot tall, 130 foot in diameter and weighs over 2 million pounds. There's one more ring section to be placed for the containment vessel before capping it off with the upper bowl. Slide 19 shows some aerial view of the unit three Nuclear Island. You can see that the CA01 one CA05 and CA20 structural modules, CA04 also has been placed but it\u2019s not visible in his picture.","Slide 20 shows the placement of the aforementioned unit three CA01. This super module was placed in the Nuclear Island in December of 2016 and will house the steam generators and pressurizer as well as form the refueling canal inside of the containment vessel. Slide 21 is a photo of the unit 2 Nuclear Island where you can see the shield building panels being placed. We\u2019re currently working on the fifth course of analysts and have 143 of the 167 panels needed to complete the unit 2 shield building. Slide 22 shows the placement of the first shield building course for unit 3. A panel for this course have been welded together and have been filled with concrete. We currently have 78 of 167 panels for the unit 3 shield building. Slide 23 presents the unit 3 module CA02. CA02 is a wall section that forms part of the in containment refueling water storage tank. All of the sub-modules have been up ended and welding is complete for this model. Slide 24 is a photo of the unit 3 CA03, this is west wall of the in containment room refueling water storage tank. Ten of the 17 needed sub models have been up ended fabrication in the community and the remaining seven sub-modules are onsite.","Slide 25 shows one of the accumulator tanks for unit 2 that was set inside of the Nuclear Island in December of 2016. There are two accumulator tanks for each unit and both of these tanks for unit 2 have been set in place. They're used to inject buried water in order to rapidly reestablish core cooling and are part of the path of safety systems. Slide 26 shows pictures of the unit three comparing December of 2015 to last month. As you can see we've made significant progress in just under 14 months. Slide 27 is the unit 2 turbine building where good progress is being made. Visible the top middle is the yellow overhead bridge crane which was recently placed. And we're now setting roof trusts. Slide 28 is the lower half outer shell for one of the low pressure turbans. There are six of these for unit and all six of them place for unit 2. Slide 29 shows a picture of the Sanmen plant in China. We have had our personnel involved in hot functional testing at Sanmen unit 1. And we've gained valuable experience. Additionally, we have recently participated in start up readiness inspections at the high on unit 1. We anticipate start up and operation of both of these units this year.","This completes my update on construction, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin to discuss the situation with Toshiba.","Kevin Marsh","Thanks Steve. I would like to direct your attention to Slide 30. We continue to monitor Toshiba's financial situation and their proposed recovery plans. Although ideally Toshiba would be without the stresses we still anticipate completing two new nuclear units which will enable us to provide our customers with safe reliable energy for decades to come. As previously mentioned in our press release Westinghouse officials told us earlier this week that they along with the Toshiba remain committed to completing the construction of these units. As Jimmy mentioned earlier we also received new in service dates from Westinghouse and we will be reviewing the corresponding integrated project schedule supporting these dates once they provide it to us. After our review and once we've completed our evaluation, we will make you aware of any changes or implications information may have. This would most likely take place during our first quarter 2017 earnings call.","While we are pleased that Westinghouse and Toshiba have reaffirmed their commitment to completing the project, we continue to look for ways to mitigate project risk for our customers and shareholders. If for any reason Westinghouse exits the project. We will evaluate the facts and circumstances at that time to determine the most prudent action for our company and customers. However we have already initiated steps as identified in our original EPC contract to assist in the only transition to a new construction team and assist in the continuation of construction activities. If necessary, in December of 2015, Toshiba\u2019s credit ratings slipped into speculative grade which triggered a provision in our contract requiring Westinghouse to establish a surety bond in the form of a letter of credit which can range up to $100 million. Additional, we initiated a contractual process to escrow intellectual property and software for the AP 1000 design. Should it become necessary having access to the AP 1000 design and software and the ability to call on the letter of credit would assist with a transition to a new construction team. Under this scenario we could evaluate options of serving as a general contractor, entering into a new EPC contract for the remainder of construction or entering into a procurement and construction contract and supply the engineering support our sales or through a third-party engineering firm.","As to the end of 2016, all major equipment has been procured, received onsite or is in fabrication. Additionally, our amended EPC contract requires Westinghouse to begin paying liquidated damages to SCE&G and our project partner Santee Cooper to cap out at $676 million based if the construction goes beyond August 2019 and August 2020, guaranteed substantial completion date for the new units and our current EPC agreement. As you can see from Steve\u2019s update, we are making substantial progress on these new plants and remain focused on continued progress toward their completion. Again, we will continue to monitor this situation closely and will alert you if we are made aware of any changes.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes today from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So I wanted to just follow up a little bit a lot of - I imagine a lot of questions her around it, but first just a little bit of an update of worker productivity to the extent which you have a sense. Given the new timelines released obviously recently what's your level of confidence against these timelines particularly given some of the risks around further delay on the second unit. Do you have any sense of that?","Steve Byrne","This is Steve, when you say that the second unit, you\u2019re talking about the second new unit or you\u2019re talking about unit two which is\u2026","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","The second new unit and the 2020 deadline.","Steve Byrne","So what we\u2019ve seen so far is that the efficiency factors have increased significantly unit 3, our second new unit. In some cases it's a matter of hours, in other cases it's double or triple the efficiency factor for the second unit. So we're learning the lessons from the first unit and applying them to the second unit and it's going much, much more smoothly. So I have a reasonable confidence in the efficiency gains for the second new unit. What we're doing with the schedule now is we're taking the assumptions that Westinghouse took in their schedule that they gave to us when they gave us the new dates on Tuesday. And we\u2019re evaluating what those assumptions are and what kind of efficiency numbers are in there. We do think that they have to increase their performance while increase the efficiency factors and they've got some plans laid out to do that. So we're going to be very interested to see it, as Kevin pointed out we're going to be going through that schedule over the next month or so and we got to be able to report out our level of confidence in that probably the next quarterly call.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","And to be clear about what we should expect at the time of the next quarterly call relative to what you've reflected today, largely the increase as far as your concern is a capital cost increase. Correct? Related to capitalizing interest. ","Steve Byrne","When you say increase which increase are you discussing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Simply the delay in the project itself should have some capitalized interest in equity cost that you would bake into the project cost I would imagine. And maybe actually to be very clear about this, I think previously you guys have to talked about a $10 million a month I think perhaps per unit of cost.","Steve Byrne","Julien, I think you\u2019re talking about what we would call the owners cost which we're not necessarily carrying cost what we're talking about is the amount of staff and the expenses that we have to accrue each month things like increased, NRC fees that kind of thing. But the bulk of it is going to be carrying the staff that we have to carry. So if what we're talking about is the short delays that we announced, I think it was Tuesday or yesterday relative to the schedule information that we got from Westinghouse, we're looking at numbers along the lines on one 100% basis about 12.5 million. In what we would call our ongoing onerous costs and of course those would be offset by liquidated damages which would start to accrue when they don't hit the existing guaranteed substantial completion dates of August of \u201919 and August if \u201820. So at a macro scale we think that as long as they can complete them in the timeframe that they've laid out, our incremental onerous cost should be more or less offset by the liquidated damages.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So barring a change in how Westinghouse and Toshiba decide to move forward, but actually really isn\u2019t effective had changed for consumers as far as their realized rates are concerned.","Steve Byrne","We see very little change there.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you, I\u2019ll let someone else ask.","Kevin Marsh","And Julien just to be clear I think that 10 million a month that you were talking about earlier that we previously referenced was more unlikely our 55% share of the costs going back probably a year ago. So the costs have increased a little bit and what I gave recently was the 1100% cost numbers.","Operator","The next question will come from Travis Miller with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Got one non-nuclear question and one nuclear one. I\u2019ll start with a non-nuclear one, what electric customer usage growth. Do you guys have to hit over the next two years call it 2017, 2018 to hit that 9% earned ROE that you guys are targeting?","Jimmy Addison","Yes specifically, this is Jimmy, specifically for \u201817 it's basically a wash in our plan between the addition of new customers as well as kind of the loss of margin from all customers just due to efficiency working through the system. I don't have a specific target in there for \u201818 but generally at that same level.","Travis Miller","[indiscernible] net zero type growth.","Jimmy Addison","Yeah. It\u2019s not precisely zero but it\u2019s very close to as relatively flat.","Travis Miller","So that would be investing about at a maintenance type level ex-nuclear?","Jimmy Addison","Ask that again let me make sure I\u2019m following that part.","Travis Miller","So that would be investing at essentially a maintenance type level non-nuclear, so that rate base stays very similar.","Jimmy Addison","You see in our CapEx plans we got and SCE&G business which includes SCE&G Gas, we've got about 400 million a year, 466 at the peak in \u201919 and generally that is going - in electric side is going to be matched against the DNA that's occurring on the book basis, so no significant change in rate base.","Travis Miller","And then walk me through what a worst case scenario on the nuclear side might look like if you were to get to some kind of stranded cost type situation.","Kevin Marsh","Hi Travis, this is Kevin, let me take a stab at that. First of all it\u2019s difficult to speculate on exactly what the status construction would look like if they were to - if Westinghouse where the exit the house. If that were to happen, I would expect that SCE&G along with our partner Santee Cooper would go through thorough assessment of the facts and circumstances that time and make some decisions around what options we thought might be appropriate and then certainly engage the Office of Regulatory Staff and the Commission to determine the most prudent path forward. But in terms of what that construction could look like, first of all we've begun escrowing the 81,000 intellectual property and software to make sure we got access to design if we were going to be responsible for continue with the project. We've got to surety bond in the form of standby letters of credit in place to make sure we've got some liquidity to help us make an orderly transition to a new construction team.","But with the construction team specifically, we could make a decision to serve as a general contractor, we could look at entering into a new EPC contract or we could look to find someone just to do the procurement and construction. So we would certainly consider all those kind of look at the last case option the abandonment provisions under the BLRA that's not something that's high on our list, we would certainly like to finish these projects, they are critical to us over the long-term and meeting customers\u2019 needs and the growth we expect to see in the state of South Carolina over the long term and even though Mr. Trump has talked about changing some of the rules that might be in effect on clean air regulation. I believe people will continue to be focused on clean air and as much carbon free emissions as we can. So we're sticking with our strategy and these plants are critical to do that. So we have to evaluate the circumstances very carefully and then figure the most prudent path forward.","Travis Miller","And then the abandonment clause in the BLRA, you feel confident that given this type of situation that's happened, it would still be valid? Is that right?","Kevin Marsh","Well I mean certainly it's never been exercised. The Base Load Review Act has been implemented for the first time with the construction of our projects. But the intent when that was written by the parties that drafted and approved it was to make sure if something happened that was outside of the ordinary course of business or some unusual circumstance would arise that investors would not be restrained in that investment. But what it assumes is there is a very thorough evaluation done and that our company along with the Commission and Office of Regulatory Staff would deem that to be the most prudent course of action. We're not advocating that, we're not saying we're at that point but it is one of the items that is on the list. If you go through the evaluation should Westinghouse decide to exit the project. But what we know at this point is Westinghouse and Toshiba have reaffirmed their commitment to finish the project. I think the presentations that Toshiba has made indicate that if they recognize that\u2019s their obligation and they are taking steps to try to shore up their balance sheet to be able to fulfill that. They were clear in their discussions with us earlier this week that they intent to finish the project. They are in the process of reviewing that schedule with us now, so they're taking the steps to indicate they're going to back up their commitment. So we are banking on that but certainly we're going to watch the developments very carefully as we go forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from Stephen Byrd of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrd","Wanted to discuss the abandonment provision of the BLRA. If the issues with the budget and the cost overruns are really driven by nothing changing to the license reactor design, but rather more ordinary course scheduling issues overruns, and also the fact that Toshiba may not be able to meet its financial obligations, is that under the abandonment provision? Is that a cause for being able to get recovery for the money spent to date?","Kevin Marsh","The provision is not specific as to exactly what it would cover. There was not an effort to make a listing of the types of items it would qualify. It's more specifically focused on what would be deemed prudent at the time that decision was made and that clearly means in the regulatory space that they would have to be a meeting of demands and in serious evaluation of where the project is, where it might cost to complete and then jointly make that decision is to the most prudent action. It would be extremely difficult not knowing all the facts and circumstances to try to list what would or would not qualify under that provision. And generally prudency is the rule that commission banks on at the end of the day.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. And Toshiba had laid out, I think, a little over $6 billion charge. Do you have a sense for where the budget is at the moment for the project overall? I know from your perspective you have protection on your EPC contract, but do you have a sense for where the budget estimate is based on your conversations with Toshiba and Westinghouse?","Steve Byrne","This is Steve, I'm not sure that we have a handle yet on what the budget estimate, of course we are focused on them performing now under a construction milestone payments schedule. So they had a milestone than they get paid. What we don't have is some of the details around what kind of contingencies that they have and the impairment that they announced. So that's something that we would not have direct line of sight over. So I couldn't give you an exact budget if you\u2019re talking about the Westinghouse portion of the budget. You might have to ask them but you know from our perspective we're focused on the construction milestone payment schedule. And then from June of 2015 we had about 6.082 billion to go.","Jimmy Addison","Stephen, this is Jimmy. Just to supplement they have represented to us obviously that covers all of their US projects ours and those in Georgia and they have represented to us as Steve alluded to that it does include contingencies and reserves we're just not sure of the levels of those et cetera.","Stephen Byrd","Okay, understood. And lastly, quickly on Sanmen, you laid out the status update here. I think the prior update was that Sanmen was going to be operational in 2016. Do you have a sense for the cause for the delay into 2017?","Steve Byrne","I'm not sure I have a direct line of sight on all of the causes and now when they went through hot functional testing they discovered a few things. So they've got a couple of equipment issues that they have to rectify. But I don't see those as large holdups. And for example we made available some bolts that they needed for one barrel that they asked for us this month. So this is something we don't need till 2017 for our trailing units. So we're glad - sorry to 2018 for trailing units, we're glad to give it to them. But we fully anticipate that they'll load fuel shortly they'll start up this year.","Operator","The next question will come from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Kamal Patel","I had two questions. One regarding the progress on summer. Where do you stand? Do you still stand in a position where you've made advances? Or are you where you aren't making advances anymore?","Kevin Marsh","On the construction milestone payments schedule, are you talking about Kamal?","Kamal Patel","Yes.","Kevin Marsh","We received an order from the Dispute Resolution Board late last year and as of December we are now making payments strictly under that construction milestone payments schedule. So we don't have any catch up payments to make if that's what you asked.","Kamal Patel","Okay. And there's no reverse catch-up work that Westinghouse owes to you under that payment schedule?","Kevin Marsh","No.","Kamal Patel","Second question, there's plenty of other what-ifs on the Summer, but with regard to the dividend increase, it's above what you did last year. I'm wondering what the premise was behind bumping it up above what we saw last year, given the headlines we're seeing around the project itself.","Kevin Marsh","Yes. It's really being consistent and transparent with what we've said before, which is we're committed at this point to growing it fairly consistent with earnings. And you've seen an increase in earnings projected for \u201917 that's actually slightly above the dividend increase. So that was the consideration.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I guess one question for Kevin, you talked a little bit about the letters of credit, but can you quantify just how much has been set aside and did I hear correctly that the max or the maximum is around $100 million dollars or the letters of credit and the postings that you\u2019ve vesting out, could that be a bigger number to help do the bridge in case there's a switch in contractors?","Kevin Marsh","Under the contract, there is a form that we go through based on previous month's construction totals and we have in place now the 45 million, the max end of that form is around 100 million. So that is formulae in the contract we have in place today and don\u2019t have any expected changes in that as of today.","Michael Lapides","Got you. Okay. And the other thing is, what is the timeline. When do you need to get the projects put in service and we saw the detail in the BLRA filing earlier this week about the potential change in schedule. When do you have to get them in service to ensure you qualify both for the production tax credits and for bonus depreciation and does that date differ from either of those?","Steve Byrne","Michael, this is Steve. For the production tax credit basis, we have to have them operating by 2021.","Jimmy Addison","And generally, it's the same for bonus, but recall that with the 174 strategy that really neutralizes as a great deal of the bonus advantage, so that's booking even in advance of --","Michael Lapides","Okay. So in the situation, there are already pushing unit three out, assuming the schedule they submitted holds and what's in the BLRA filing. Assuming Unit 3 is December of 2020, if that pushes out another couple of months, sometime between now and then, it's conceivable that unit wouldn't qualify for PTCs","Steve Byrne","That possibility exists. There are a couple things. There are yet undefined relative to or untested relative to qualification for production tax credits. One is, what is the definition of in service, because certainly we\u2019ll be making some power from those units prior to declaring it in service. So if making power qualifies them, we\u2019ll be ahead of those dates. So that just gives us a little bit more room probably on the older two months. And the other thing that we're looking forward to is the opportunity to see if we can get an extension on the dates for the production tax credit qualification because all of the basic tenants around the establishment of what those production tax credits are there do still exist for both our project and for the southern company project.","Kevin Marsh","And Michael, this is Kevin. I'll add one piece to that. I certainly can't speak for Westinghouse and Toshiba, but I am comfortable repeating what we saw in the translation of their Q&A after they did their preliminary release the other day. And in their comments, they were asked about the loss and how that attributed to the efficiency of the schedule worked, it was structural work that was being done at the plant site and what they said in that release in my words was that PWC was very conservative and looking at that schedule calculation and that they would not allow them to include in that, any projected improvements in productivity. ","So I would assume from that that the schedule they've got is based on current productivity rates which we know from discussions we've had in the past have not been ideal. That's been a primary area of focus for them. Fluor has been on site for a year now and I believe they've identified opportunities for improvement. So to the extent they can find those improvements and I would expect that to improve their overall schedule and possibly give us more comfort around those dates, certainly that December date for 2020 is pushing up against the deadline, but I just wanted to pass those comments on from the Toshiba executives\u2019 feedback to those questions in Japan earlier this week.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And one final, just actually on the core business on the gas side. Should we expect you come in to the regulators and ask for incremental gas revenue increases at SCE&G over the next year, year-and-a-half or so, just given the earned ROE levels and do you anticipate kind of every other year or so rate case filing on the PSNC side?","Steve Byrne","Michael on South Carolina, we don't have a litigated hearing. We've got a process that just measures that at the end of March of each year and if we're over 150 basis points, there's an adjustment. Those are usually very small, we have one this initiative that\u2019s about 1%. So we don't have anything in our plan right now for one this coming fall and November of \u201917 but really the results at the end of the heating season will help determine that. And on. PSNC, I think we're generally in the three or so year, three to four year timeframe for rate cases in that environment with the rapid expansion that's there now. And if you'll note, our CapEx forecast over the next three years compared to the current rate base, we're looking at CapEx additions of about 75% percent of the existing rate base in that business over the next three years. However, about half of that is covered in new revenues either through the integrity management rider or through direct industrial contracts. So that helps mitigate the need for frequency of general rating for instance in North Carolina.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andy Levi","Hey, guys. How are you? Thank you for taking my call. I really appreciate it. Just to understand just a few nuclear questions. Just on the fixed cost contract, is it focused more on productivity. Is that -- as far as what covers you? Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?","Jimmy Addison","Sorry, Andy, the fixed price option, we looked at productivity when we were renegotiating the contract and really wanted to take that out of the equation. So, the fixed price option really affords us the protections and gives us what the prices going forward almost regardless of the productivity, such that if they don't improve the productivity numbers, then they're hurting themselves. And I think we talked about a little bit earlier that the real downside liability for us might be our owner's costs should there be an extension of the schedule and as of right now, we think that the liquidated damages would about offset what those owner\u2019s costs are anticipated to be. But the fixed price option really was from June of 2015 when we started the discussions or when we had the last good information, when we started the discussions. From that point to the end of the project, they gave us a fixed price which was $6.082 billion. That was the to go price. Really, that was the price regardless of the efficiencies. Now, we're very interested in seeing them make improvements in the efficiencies. Certainly Fluor has done a number of things to improve the efficiencies. But they've certainly got plans to improve it even more going forward.","Andy Levi","Now, if there are design issues that the NRC has concerns with. Is that covered under this fixed price contract or not?","Kevin Marsh","In the fixed price contract, it's a change in regulation. They would then be entitled to submit a change order. One of the things we worked very hard at was ironing out the definition of change in regulation. So it now has to be a written change in the law or the regulation. So it can't be anything about interpretational things, but if it's a basic tenant of the design that the NRC just doesn't think they're living up to, that on would not qualify for a change order.","Andy Levi","So, just as an example, there was an article on Monday. I'm sure you've read it about the neutron shield block. And I guess is there design issues. I don't know if I'm saying it right, but that there were some hearings I guess going on at the NRC, that\u2019s one example. What would that fall under, if there was an increased cost or there was, it had to be much smart enough, but not redesigned, but you understand what I'm saying. ","Kevin Marsh","Yeah. So that's an issue where there has been no change in the law or the regulation. So Westinghouse would be obligated to make the changes to conform that shield block without passing along any increased cost to us. So that's a thing that they found during the functional testing at Sandman. And it's an issue of neutron shield block there, the material that was made of was getting too hot under the ambient conditions. So what they had to do was they just had to redesign it to use a different material which they've already done. So that one really is not as big a deal as it has been made out in the press I don\u2019t believe.","Andy Levi","Okay. So basically if the design is -- wasn't constructed properly, they're on the hook for, it's only if there needs to be some change in design because there's some regulatory change and thinking I guess for no better way to put, is that \u2013","Kevin Marsh","Not just the change in thinking, Andy. It has to be a written change in the law.","Andy Levi","Written change. Are there other hearings going on at the NRC. As far as other design issues going on currently?","Kevin Marsh","There are meetings on design issues going on at the NRC all the time. I'm not aware currently of anything that is looking like a change in law or the regulation that would force a change that we would be responsible to pay for.","Andy Levi","Okay. And just two more quick questions. I know like with Southern Company, their letter of credit expires every year and then it has to be renewed and administered provisions around what happens if the banks decide to pull that letter of credit, is that similar as your letter, again it\u2019s much smaller your letter of credit, but is it similar with you guys?","Kevin Marsh","It's an annual letter, but it has an auto renewal that runs through late 2020.","Andy Levi","Okay. And whose choice is it to terminate that letter of credit every year, yours or is it the banks or both?","Kevin Marsh","The banks could choose to do it, but they've got to give 60 days' notice and we have the right to draw on it immediately at that time.","Andy Levi","Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s an interesting provisions. And then my last question is, in a bankruptcy situation for Toshiba, do you just become another creditor or do you have some type of status?","Kevin Marsh","I'm not a lawyer. This is Kevin. But through our investigation, there are just a lot of different scenarios under which that can take place and it's difficult for us to speculate without knowing all those individual facts and circumstances but we continue to watch that closely and I we had a belief they were headed in that direction, we would take whatever steps we felt were appropriate to protect our project and our customers.","Andy Levi","And then I guess in that scenario of Westinghouse would default or not be able to complete the project, you'd have to find not only another contractor, but another engineer, right, because that's really what Westinghouse is doing or you would do the engineering yourself.","Kevin Marsh","Yeah. Andy, there are options there. Certainly, we couldn\u2019t do the engineering ourselves. We could go out and another EPC contractor. E in EPC is engineering. The other options are similar to what we did when we did this December, Unit no 1, we acted as a general contractor, had one company do the construction and we actually brought in another company to do the engineering. So there are a variety of options out there. There are different models in the marketplace and all of them have worked.","Andy Levi","Okay. That's great. And then I assume the NRC takes part in that too and kind of gives you a blessing on that?","Kevin Marsh","NRC is not necessarily in a position or responsible for giving us a blessing on who is the constructor. Obviously, the NRC holds us accountable for the construction and the quality.","Operator","Thank you, sir. The next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan","Hi. Good afternoon. How are you guys doing? Can I just ask you one thing that came out if you can help me a little bit because you could probably understand the slide [indiscernible] put out two days ago? So they said, the biggest change came from labor. And they said, it was actually -- what they had concluded in labor versus now what they believe the labor cost are, it\u2019s humongous number. You probably saw that slides to your team. Could you just tell me what went wrong from your point of view in terms of their calculation of those labor costs, which were exponentially higher than what they thought plan to be? And I just wanted to get, I don't know, if you can provide some color from -- on that component of it?","Steve Byrne","Ashar, this is Steve. We don't know exactly what is in all of their numbers and sometimes in the presentation from Toshiba, they kind of lump things a couple of broad categories. So there may be some bleed over in different categories, but I can tell you what they have informed us about at the Westinghouse level on the labor piece. One, they are going to have to hire more people to do the work. And then secondly, where they have made some assumptions around what they would call unit rates or how many hours it takes for people to perform a specific task, those unit rates are increasing. So for example, they would say it'll take 5 hours to pour a cubic yard of concrete, what they're finding is maybe it takes 7 hours to pour a cubic yard of concrete So for every cubic yard of concrete and there is a lot of concrete, it takes two more hours than you're getting a significant number of hours increase, which from their perspective is increase in cost. ","The other impact is what they've communicated is that when they acquired Stone & Webster, they made some assumptions about improving efficiency to the tune of about 30% improvement. And what we heard Toshiba say publicly during their call was that they have not seen those improvements. And as Kevin pointed out, Toshiba went on further to say that the scheduling information, the cost information that they put out, they have assumed no further improvements in that although they're pursuing improvements. So maybe it may have been an issue with the auditor, but they're not putting in the bank upon improvements in the cost numbers that they put out.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So then can I just ask the process? So they will come in and give you some new backup to the new dates that they\u2019ve given, right. I'm assuming that backup, you will study with Fluor or Fluor has already blessed that thing or what? So I was trying to see the decision making process, who will it be involved, but is it going to be your, the SCANA to say, hey, this is right, not right or who's going to be part of that decision making process to whether that schedule is correct or not correct?","Kevin Marsh","Yes. So the schedule information that we received so far has come from Westinghouse. They\u2019ve built that schedule with inputs from Fluor. So what we would look to do is we would look to do just to look at both aspects, we would look at the assumptions that Fluor made around things like unit rates, labor hours, labor cost. We would also then look at how Westinghouse has integrated all that information into the schedule. And the last piece is they've been performing density studies. And with a plant, even a big plant like we're building, there are limitations on how many people you can get into a specific area. So it's not as simple as understanding that a task now takes 100 hours if I put 100 people in there, I should get it done in an hour. If the room won't fit 100 people, then you cannot assume an hour. So we're going to be looking at all of those factors, we\u2019ll be looking at it in conjunction with Westinghouse and Fluor and we will have our folks doing it and then we'll more likely bring in some outside or independent help and we'll be looking at it in conjunction with our partner Santee Cooper.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So you will bring some outside help. Okay. I just wanted to kind of. Okay. And then if I can change tact a little bit, Jimmy and this is on the financial results and I don't know if these slides that you provided us in terms of flip and spending, okay, this is the best information that we know right now, of course. Let's hope it comes up pretty close to what it is. Of course, your earnings are very formulaic, because of the BLRA mechanism. You go in, you get something accepted. It falls into place. You start collecting revenues. It's a very formulaic kind of earnings. You put in the number and earnings split out. So based on the incremental quip that you have produced in today\u2019s slides, doesn\u2019t the earnings and the math provide for earnings growth, which would exceed the 4% to 6% range in the next couple of years, just from the math of the quip that you have provided. I mean that's what the math tells me. I just want to find out whether I'm thinking to that correctly or there is some big hole in the whole assumption?","Jimmy Addison","Our view of the long-term guidance is that it's a view of the CAGR over a three to five year period. Any one period might fall outside of that range, I mean on the surface of the math for \u201917, you have done the math, you can tell that it\u2019s slightly above that range, but we're not -- we're giving you separate guidance for 2017 of $4.25 with a $0.10 ban on each side. We're giving a three to five year CAGR that we believe falls within that band.","Ashar Khan","Okay. So you can have years, but it can exceed it, right? I\u2019m more talking about \u201918 and onwards, right? So what you're saying is, you want to keep the CAGR on a long-term basis but there could be years where the earnings growth could be higher than what is implied in the CAGR. Am I correct?","Jimmy Addison","You are correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from [indiscernible] with Wellington Management. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Could you tell me specifically what measures Fluor and Westinghouse can take in order to improve efficiency and your view on their ability to execute on that? Thank you.","Steve Byrne","Yeah, Chris. This is Steve. Work packages is one thing. They have been working for some time on improving work packages to make sure that folks that go to the field have what they need and they don't have to stop every time they run into a roadblock. So almost since Fluor took over, they've been working on improving the work packages. Secondly is, we\u2019ve had a lot of folks in the last year, I think Fluor has brought in 1200, 1300 incremental over the beginning of the year, but what we're focusing on now is ensuring that we bring in the right resources. So if I need welders, it doesn't do me any good to bring in fitters for example. So that's another thing that they're doing. We're looking at the possibility of changing the requirements on the secondary side of the plant or the Turbine Island side of the plant as opposed to the Nuclear Island or the nuclear side of the plant. So if I have requirements that are quality requirements that are nuclear grade, I don't necessarily have to apply those same standards to the Turbine Island or Turbine building side. ","And to date, we really -- the contractors have been applying same standards across the site. So one of the things that they can do is they can change what the standards will be. So there's no reason for me to build a nuclear grade turbine building for example. I need a faster grade turbine building, because it's the same. And then lastly, one of the things I can do to improve efficiencies is increase their nuclear expertise and the leadership team, particularly where the critical path runs and right now, for both units, that's on the Nuclear Island side. So Westinghouse is going to focus on increasing their leadership team, their nuclear background, particularly on the Nuclear Island. So that's the containment vessel or the Shield building, Annex building, Auxiliary building and heretofore, we've had a lot of folks with a lot of good construction experience, but a little light on nuclear experience. So those changes are taking place now.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. It doesn't sound like any of the stuff is insurmountable. It sounds like blocking exactly, so am I correct in assuming that you guys feel like efficiency improvements are readily achievable?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. I think the improvements that they've laid out to us are certainly achievable. Now, they've got to go out and get the expertise that they're talking about. They're at it right now. They're looking at all kinds of options and we are encouraging to include all kinds of options, including the possibility that we'll have Toshiba resources on the site. So perhaps folks from Japan that are actually doing work in the field, particularly on the trailing unit, so we're welcoming all of those changes.","Operator","The next question will come from Dan Jenkins with the State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Dan Jenkins","Hi. Good afternoon. So going back to the critical path, I noticed on your release on page 7 of the latest quarterly report, you laid out what the current critical path items are. So I was wondering if you could go through this like what the timeframe is for those items, like the -- are those -- what's the day for those items to be completed?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. Dan, for each unit, we run generally a primary, a secondary and a tertiary critical path. It's a series of activities that will culminate in finishing the unit. And as an example, when we were talking a year ago, probably even six months ago, the critical path for the first unit, unit two was the Shield building activity. So that was all of the activities, procurement, shield building, panels, delivery, installing them, filling with concrete and then moving incrementally up in the shield building. Shield building has now moved off critical path and that now runs through activities inside of the containment building. So the focus is really shifting more towards what we think it ought to be. So when we say the focus for Unit 2 has shifted into the containment vessel of building, we're talking about as things like setting up steam generators, reactor vessel, reactor coolant piping, the pressurizer, all the things that you would say form the heart and soul of a nuclear plant. So that's what we mean when we say that critical path has shifted to containment.","With regard to specific activities coming up and completing, I think you probably saw that we recently completed setting of the reactor vessel. We set the steam generator, one of two steam generators for Unit 2, we\u2019ve set the second ring section for Unit 2. We should set the third ring section for Unit 2. We think in early second quarter, a number of activities mostly focused on Unit 2, but the next steam generator for Unit 2, so there's two per unit. We\u2019ve set one, we should set the other one in the second quarter and the pressurizer should go in in the third quarter. So there are a lot of big picture activities taking place this year and the next couple of quarters, particularly around unit number 2.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. So a lot of key items coming up in -- before mid-year it sounds like then?","Steve Byrne","Yes.","Dan Jenkins","Going back to your financing plan, I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the timing you expect for 2017 for the financing.","Jimmy Addison","Yeah. Dan, this is Jimmy. So we've got, estimated around 800 million there at SCE&G in debt to do this year and I would expect that probably more than half of that, we would do before the middle of the year. So sometime in late Q1 or Q2, we would probably do 500 or so of that 800 in the balance over late in the year.","Operator","The next question will come from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good afternoon. A couple of things. One, under the BLRA structure and everything like that. I know you guys are sensitive obviously to the rate of revenue increases and things of that nature. If it were mutually desirable for some reason, is it permissible to have deferrals underneath that and then like we\u2019re carrying charges and then recoup it post operational types of things and can those types of structures work in South Carolina, you will have these stuff like that?","Jimmy Addison","I would say, I don\u2019t know if you're familiar with our 174 tax strategy and the proposed decrement rider, but essentially that is the way we propose flowing that benefit back to the customer is to help offset some of these rate increases the next couple of years during the peak nuclear construction. So while we don't see any deferral or lowering of the BLRA amount itself, we intend to protect that process and let it operate as it should annually. We do anticipate that this tax strategy is going to allow us to offset the real impact on the customer\u2019s bill on a real time basis as we implement those increases.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And secondarily, you mentioned in your opening comments about having the ability to possibly engage another EPC entity or whatever. Can you give a sense as to given where the project is today, how large a universe of companies or vendors you have to evaluate or whatever, so we can think about it in terms of who you feel is capable of stepping in if need be?","Steve Byrne","This is Steve. I think the universe is relatively small. Obviously, the folks who would be in the driver\u2019s seat there would be Fluor. Fluor is a company now that\u2019s been onsite for about a year, so they\u2019ve probably got most of the new nuclear construction experience certainly in this country. There are other companies in the US that could do it, [indiscernible] and probably one or two others and then around the world, there are a number of companies that have recent nuclear construction experience, AREVA is another company that would come to mind, a French company, but certainly they have operations here in the United States and have a US wing, so they can actually do some of this construction. So, there are a variety of options available to us, a number in this country but worldwide, it's a much bigger field.","Unidentified Analyst","And also I think in an earlier question, you were talking about the various critical path activities that you have coming up here over the first half of this year and going forward. At what point, how close are you guys to getting to a point where the construction project is like now becomes a more traditional construction project. And if -- nuclear in and of itself is no longer like the defining factor in terms of getting from here to there.","Steve Byrne","Yeah. I think we're actually pretty close to that. When you go through any major construction project, you do side press, excavation, we\u2019re through all of those. You discover things about the site that perhaps you can back where we're through all of that. One of our bigger challenges was the procurement as the nuclear supply chain went dormant for many years. We've had to stimulate that again. But the majority of the manger equipment is actually on our site, stored and the remainder of as has been fabricated and some of it's actually on the high seas as we speak. So I think by the end of the quarter, we'll probably have ninety plus percent of the major equipment on the site. We're actually starting to accumulate most of the valves, for example, we've got 5500. 5600 valves that go into this plant and I think we've got 5400 of them at the site. So from an equipment perspective, we're getting our handle on that. One of our bigger issues was the initial fabrication facility for structural modules. That was in Lake Charles, Louisiana. ","That facility was problematic for us for a long period of time. We have divested ourselves from the facility, so Westinghouse no longer has any modules, structural or otherwise for Lake Charles facility. We have spun off other fabricators to handle modules and all those other fabricators seem to be doing a much, much better job of it. And Westinghouse is set to become accustomed to what it meant to build one of these plants under the combined construction and operating license framework that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has and we would call that a part 52 license. So you really have to construct it as it was designed. So that experience has been painful for the contractor and for us, but that experiences has been learned. I don't think that we're going to see quantum leap in productivity for unit 3, our second new unit. If we finish with the first one, we put the experience into our data bank and then we apply it to the second unit, unit 3. So most of those unique nuclear activities I think are getting behind us. ","Now, we've got to focus on staffing the plant to the appropriate level with the right resources and bringing in leadership that understands what it takes to build a nuclear project and what the differences are between I\u2019d say traditional construction and nuclear construction. So when Westinghouse discusses bringing in additional nuclear savvy resources on the Nuclear Island, what they're really talking about functionally is a bifurcation of the site such that we acquired the non-nuclear standards to the non-nuclear portion of the plant and certainly Fluor has been very good at that. Even for us, Fluor has built non-nuclear turbines for us. They\u2019ve built gas plants and coal plants and other things for us. So with regard to your question a long winded answer, but I think we're getting to that point very rapidly, where the unique nuclear aspects and the unique aspects of this new regulatory framework are getting behind us. We've had challenges that you probably don't see in construction, even in things like getting our operator\u2019s license which is one reason I highlighted it in my comments upfront. But I would have to say that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is, they've been learning some things, but they are working with us very well to make sure that we have those licensed operators when we need them to load fuel.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess one last thing, it\u2019s probably for Jimmy. Have you had any discussions with the agencies in terms of how perhaps a more elongated and elevated construction budget and that type of thing might affect our ratings or might affect your financing approach going forward?","Jimmy Addison","We've had timely discussions with all three in the last week or so and really an elongated schedule doesn't really have an impact per se, because of the aforementioned tax regime. I discussed it's really, our ratios are in pretty good shape and all of them were fairly comfortable with that. The real issue that they are continuing to watch like we all are is just to make sure that Westinghouse is able to deliver on what they've said they will deliver on this week. The concern that the agencies have is the same ones that we have, which is that if they were to not honor those contracts, what would the potential impact be? So I would say that's the only issue not really on elongated schedule.","Operator","The next question is from Claire Tse with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Sorry. This is David. Sorry to sneak in a question at the end here, but just in your long term growth rate, are you assuming that the ROE on the nuclear project is reset to whatever the prevailing ROE is at that time?","Jimmy Addison","David, you might think of it as vintages, so whatever's out there today will stay at the rate that it is. So the vast majority that's in in rate base today is at 11%, the most recent increment was at 10.5, the increase, it was just effective a few months ago. And then those prospective being the first one would be the one we would file in \u201817 would be at the 10.25 and the ones thereafter would be 10.25, but there is no resetting of the prior.","Unidentified Analyst","So if I understand that then, it looks just hypothetically speaking 2021, both units are fully in service. The ROEs are -- are at more in pieces, not getting whatever the prevailing SCE&G ROE is in 2021?","Jimmy Addison","Right. So in the interim period, what I described is what's happened -- what happens at the end, it all goes into general rate base. There is no nuclear and non-nuclear rate base at the end. So it all goes into one rate base pot, you view that as, you see what the overall rate is and you would of course compare that to what the allowed is at that point and would give consideration to whatever the current market conditions are.","Unidentified Analyst","I understand. So really some rate case post 2021 assuming everything's in service. That's when you have just one ROE, allowed ROE for your entire SCE&G rate base, including the nuclear units?","Jimmy Addison","That's right.","Operator","The next question will be from Mitchell Moss of Lord Abbett. Please go ahead.","Mitchell Moss","Hey, guys. Just wanted to get a little clarification. On the slide 30, you mentioned in-service dates and in prior presentations, you've mentioned guaranteed substantial completion dates. Are those the same? In other words, is the guaranteed substantial completion date now April 2020 and December 2020?","Steve Byrne","Yeah. This is Steve, Mitchell. No, the days are not the same. The guaranteed substantial completion date is our contractual day and those are used to start the calculation for liquidated damages. So if the plants are not in service by the guaranteed substantial completion dates, which are not changed, then liquidity damages would start to accrue. The Westinghouse numbers that we've put out for the in-service dates, that's when Westinghouse has told us now they expect the plants to be in service.","Mitchell Moss","So in other words, if it goes sort of as planned from August of \u201919 for Unit 2 for instance, from August of \u201919 through April of 2020, liquidated damages will accrue?","Steve Byrne","Correct.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. And for the purposes of the regulatory approval of the, I guess, the final regulatory approval beyond Westinghouse\u2019s in-service dates, is there additional testing or timing, anything else before the regulators will give its final approval I guess on this?","Kevin Marsh","Are you speaking of NRC or state?","Mitchell Moss","State. Yeah. Under the BLRA I guess, just to say that this project's effect would be completed. ","Kevin Marsh","The state regulation, the BLRA, when they grant us the venues in the first day up front, it includes the right to construct it and operate the plant. So we don't have to have another hearing at the conclusion to have it put in to service. We filed an estimate of the O&M cost, the depreciation, ex cetera that goes in and the last be already proceeding, but that's not a litigated proceeding.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. But there doesn\u2019t need to be any type of an operating performance test for some of the amount of time post the in-service dates, anything like that?","Kevin Marsh","I\u2019m going to hand that back to Steve to talk about operator in our sleeve perspective, et cetera.","Steve Byrne","Yes. So contractually, as we put the plants in service, that means that they have to have passed a performance test. So yeah, they will not only have completed the plant, we will have loaded a few, we will have done our startup testing, but the plants have to be operating at or near 100% for a period of time where they can guarantee -- where they can prove to us that the output guarantee has also been met. So yeah, the plants will be up and operating by the time they claim substantial completion.","Mitchell Moss","Do you have an estimate of about what the period of time is?","Steve Byrne","From fuel load to substantial completion, there's about six months. And when Westinghouse is giving us their in-service states, that's a substantial completion date.","Mitchell Moss","Okay. And then operating at 100% time, is that after substantial completion now?","Steve Byrne","No. The substantial completion, they have to demonstrate that the units are performing as they have told us they will perform. So then you don't have to actually have been at 100% and they have to run a test to verify that the megawatt output is what they guarantee that would be at 100%.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Marsh for any closing remarks.","Kevin Marsh","Thank you. 2016, although not without its various challenges, marked another successful year for our company. We are very pleased with our underlying economic growth, the operation of our businesses and our financial results. We look forward to 2017 and continue to focus on the nuclear construction project as well as on operating all businesses in a safe, reliable and efficient manner.

Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Operator","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 20, 2014. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. Joining us in the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G. During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory and regulatory activity. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","I would also like to mention again that we now post new nuclear project-related information directly to our website at scana.com. On SCANA's Home page, there's a yellow box containing a link to the new nuclear section of the website that contains a link to project news and updates. It is possible that some of the information that we will be posting from time to time may be deemed material information that has not otherwise become public. In connection with this process, we have discontinued our prior practice of furnishing on Form 8-K the quarterly reports that SCE&G submits to the Public Service Commission of South Carolina and the South Carolina Office of Regulatory Staff for SCE&G's new nuclear projects. Instead, the company now posts copies of these reports in the new nuclear section of the SCANA website.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Jimmy, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made today on the call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the company's Investor Relations section of the website.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Byron. And thank you all for joining us today.","I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $0.73 per share compared to $0.79 per share in the same quarter of 2012. Higher margins from base rate increases and customer growth were more than offset by expected increases in operation and maintenance expenses and CapEx-related items, including depreciation, property taxes and share dilution. You will also note in the footnote at the bottom of the slide that other income in Q4 of 2012 included the impact of some tower sales at our telecom subsidiary, as we do in the normal course of business from time to time. There were no such sales in 2013.","Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the full year of 2013 were $3.40 versus $3.20 in 2012. Increases in electric margin due primarily to base rate increases and customer growth, as well as higher gas margins, were partially offset by increases in O&M and higher expenses and dilution related to our capital program. Results in the upper half of our guidance are consistent with our message on the Third Quarter Call in October.","For the year, our O&M increased approximately 2.5% over 2012 principally due to specific rate-case-related expenses and the amortization of previously deferred items. The additional O&M increases that we had projected at the beginning of the year were largely mitigated by cost-control efforts such as lower labor cost due to attrition. These cost-control efforts, along with other items such as lower incentive comp accruals, resulted in relatively flat O&M growth year-over-year, except for the regulatory amortizations.","Now on Slide 5, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's full year 2013 earnings were up $0.13 compared to 2012, driven largely by higher margins from an electric base rate increase as well as increases under the Base Load Review Act and the gas rate stabilization act, along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses, property taxes, interest and depreciation expenses and share dilution. For the fourth quarter, SCE&G's earnings were $0.03 lower than the same period last year due mainly to dilution.","PSNC Energy's earnings for 2013 were $0.37 per share compared to $0.38 per share in 2012. Increased margins from customer growth were offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation and dilution. Similar to the full year, the fourth quarter was down $0.01.","The earnings for SCANA Energy, our retail natural gas marketing business in Georgia, in green, showed an increase of $0.09 over last year primarily due to a return to normal weather during the first quarter of 2013. For the quarter, SCANA Energy's earnings were $0.06, equal to the same period of last year.","SCANA's corporate and other businesses reported flat earnings in the fourth quarter compared to a gain of $0.02 in 2012 related to the 2012 tower sales noted earlier. For the full year, these businesses reported basic earnings per share of $0.04 in 2013 compared to $0.05 in 2012.","I would like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 6. We continued to see new business growth and expansion of existing businesses. During 2013, companies announced plans to invest approximately $2.5 billion with expectations of creating approximately 10,000 jobs in our Carolinas territories. We're excited about the continued economic development in the region. At the bottom of the slide, you can see that the national unemployment rate, along with the 3 states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. While all these states continue to show marked improvement, the Carolinas are benefiting greatly from the industrial expansion. Specifically, South Carolina's jobless rate dropped below the national average for the first time since 2001. South Carolina's unemployment rate is now 6.6%, and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.4%.","Another positive data point on the economy is the recent United Van Lines' annual migration study. South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third, respectively, in terms of domestic migration destinations, corroborating our realized customer growth. These are all very positive signs for our territories.","Slide 7 presents customer growth in electric sales. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G's electric and gas growth rates for the year are 1.2% and 2.1%, respectively. Our regulated gas businesses in North Carolina added customers at a 2.3% rate.","The bottom table outlines our weather-normalized kilowatt hour sales for the quarter and the full year. Overall, weather-normalized total retail sales were up 1.9% for the fourth quarter and down 0.5% on a 12-month-ended basis. We are particularly encouraged by the industrial expansion, which has been mitigated by the efficiency and conservation into residential and commercial markets.","Now please turn to Slide 8, which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of approximately $8.2 billion. As denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business.","In the block on the top right, you will see SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The 2013 earned return in the electric business is approximately 9.5%, well within our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, is essential to achieving this goal. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page on our new nuclear business, we are allowed an 11% return on equity. The South Carolina PSC approved our request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $570 million to our rate base and increased rates just under 2.9% in November. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continued to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North and South Carolina, respectively, and we continue to operate these businesses close to those returns.","Along the bottom of the page is our regulatory schedule, exclusive of BLRA filings. These items are fairly routine annual filings.","Slide 9 presents our updated CapEx forecast. The CapEx at new nuclear reflects Westinghouse and CB&I's projected cash flow estimates supporting the current in-service ranges for Units 2 and 3. The projected cash flow reflects changes made by the consortium and the timing of certain payments. These projected cash flow estimates do not include the estimated $200 million in-service delay cost. The previous cash flow estimates were SCANA's internal estimates with input from Westinghouse and CB&I.","Forecasted CapEx in SCE&G, outside of the new nuclear deployment, increased slightly due to increased projected capital expenditures in our generation, transmission and distribution categories. Capital expenditures at remaining subsidiaries remain largely consistent.","Along the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period, on which the BLRA increase is calculated.","Now please turn to Slide 10 to review our estimated financing plan through 2018. The slide is consistent with the forecast from our last calls, other than the addition of 2018. To summarize our financing for 2013: We successfully settled our equity forward, resulting in the issuance of 6.6 million shares in early March and executed on-plan the equity financing through our 401(k) and reinvestment plans. SCE&G also issued $400 million in first mortgage bonds in June.","The financing plan, CapEx plan and in-service dates for Unit 2 and 3 reflect the current assessment of our new nuclear construction project as well as other projects. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to inflation, construction schedule or other factors.","I would now like to discuss our 2014 weather-normalized earnings guidance and related assumptions, as shown on Slide 11. Our 2014 guidance is $3.45 to $3.65 per share, and our internal target is $3.55 per share. Due to the cyclical nature of our business, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in each of the first and third quarters, approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and the remainder in the second quarter. Additionally, we are resetting our base year to 2013 based on 2013 GAAP basic EPS of $3.40 per share. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA. This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.","Additionally, while we anticipate the number of customers will continue to increase, our assumption of customer average use of electricity is slightly lower next year to reflect current energy efficiency trends. We anticipate overall retail sales growth for 2014 to decline by approximately 0.2%. We forecast customer growth to be similar to 2013.","We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 3% higher in 2014 compared to 2013 actuals. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx-related costs of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was approximately 32%, and we estimate the rate for 2014 will be similar.","Keeping in mind our internal target of $3.55, let's discuss potential upside and downside variables to our 2014 earnings range. There are several factors that could cause us to trend towards the lower end of our guidance. We continue to see fluctuations in average use. There continues to be industry uncertainty around electricity consumption, and as a result, we have forecasted average use to be slightly lower. Average use could come in lower than forecast due to higher efficiency adoption rates or simply conservation.","Customer growth continues to be a bright spot in our service territory. We are currently forecasting an increase for 2014. However, if customer growth comes in lower than expected, this could negatively impact earnings. Additionally, if nuclear spending were to shift to later years, it would impact our earnings. In contrast, there are several factors that could push us towards the upper end of our guidance. If average use were to increase or come in better than in 2013 or customer growth accelerates beyond 2013 levels, we could have potential upside.","Finally, as we reported last year, the pilot weather-normalization program in the electric sector ended as of December 2013, and we will see the impact of weather in our financials prospectively. Hopefully, this should provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2014 as you update your models.","I also wanted to mention that, earlier today, we announced an increase to our annual dividend rate for 2014 to $2.10 per share, a 3.5% increase. The results of 2013 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We are not -- now back within our stated payout policy of 55% to 60% and expect to grow dividends fairly consistent with earnings prospectively.","Please turn to Slide 12. On January 27, we announced plans to increase our ownership in the V.C. Summer new nuclear units by 5% in the future. I will comment on a few financial matters related to this transaction, and Steve will comment later on the incremental capacity. As noted on the table, each incremented ownership interest will be funded with internal cash flow, driven largely by depreciation associated with the 2 new units. As a result, we do not expect to access the capital markets to fund this increase.","This transaction will not occur until Unit 2 is complete, and therefore, no change in the base load review formulaic increases will occur. Additionally, the estimated $500 million purchase will add to SCE&G's rate base incrementally with each annual purchase. And we will work to develop a plan to mitigate and possibly eliminate any upward pressure on customers' rates due to this purchase in the future.","In summary, we're very pleased with this transaction as it will add to base load generation for the long-term benefit of South Carolinians. We plan to file a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina for approval of the transaction later this year.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to further describe the impact of the transaction on our reserve margin and operations, as well as an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy.","I'd like to continue the discussion on the agreement with Santee Cooper. In looking at our future generation needs in the integrated resource plan, the company decided that purchasing additional nuclear power was a great fit to help us replace a portion of the older coal-fired plants we expect to retire over the next few years, and delay our need to build new gas-fired capacity after the year 2020.","The structure of the 5% acquisition will happen in 3 stages. The first stage is triggered by the commercial operation date of the first new nuclear unit, which is currently anticipated to be late 2017 or the first quarter of 2018. At the time of commercial operation of the first new nuclear unit, we will acquire 1% or approximately 22 megawatts, with an additional 2% or 44 megawatts to be acquired no later than the first anniversary of the commercial operation date and the final 2% or 44 megawatts being acquired no later than the second anniversary of the commercial operation date. This approach keeps our reserve margins within our committed targets of 14% to 20%.","Now I'd like to outline the impact of the additional 110 megawatts on our generation mix as we dispatch our plants. On Slide 13, you can see our generation mix by dispatch and capacity. This is then updated to reflect the effects of the additional 5% share of the new nuclear generation through 2020. This additional phased increment still maintains our balanced approach to capacity, keeping nuclear, coal and gas at roughly 1\/3 each, with the remainder of our generation in hydro, biomass and solar. From an operational perspective, this non-emitting base load generation will fit nicely into our system and allow us to forestall the addition of peaking generators while satisfying Santee Cooper's needs to divest of some of their share.","I'll now provide an update on our new nuclear construction project. Please turn to Slide 14. The company is reaffirming that we expect Unit 2's in-service date to be between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. This date is still within the Public Service Commission's 18-month schedule contingency window for the currently approved in-service date, which is March of 2017. In-service date for Unit 3 will be similarly delayed, or roughly 12 months after Unit 2. The company is also reaffirming the previously reported estimate of approximately $200 million of additional costs associated with this schedule change. While we continue our discussions with the consortium, we believe SCE&G's responsibility for any portion of the $200 million estimate should ultimately be limited to substantially less once all of the relevant factors are considered.","I'll now provide a brief update to the on hook dates for some of our structural modules. As I previously mentioned, the on hook date is when fabrication of an assembled module at our V.C. Summer site will allow it to be placed on the hook of the heavy lift derrick. Module CA-20, see on Slide 15, is an auxiliary building module that will be located outside and adjacent to the containment vessel. All CA-20 structural submodules have been received on-site and 2 of the 4 major subassemblies uprighted and set into place on the assembly platen in the Module Assembly Building, as well as parts of the third and fourth subassembly. The remaining few components of the subassemblies are being inspected, repaired on-site and are being prepared for installation on the platen. This module is scheduled for an on hook date of the fourth -- first quarter of 2014.","Module CA-01, on Slide 16, is a steam generator and refueling canal module that will be located inside the containment vessel. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of CA-01 at one of the China sites. On-site fabrication of this module should begin soon. This module has an on hook date of the third quarter of 2014.","Module CA-03, on Slide 17, is the southwest wall of the in-reactor water storage tank located inside the containment vessel. Fabrication of module CA-03 is progressing at Pegasus Steel's fab facilities in North Charleston, South Carolina. Here, you can see a photo provided by Westinghouse of a portion of this module at a similar AP1000 plant being lifted for placement. This module has an on hook date of fourth quarter of 2014.","The Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 2, shown on Slide 18, is the second ring of the containment vessel. This structure has an on hook date of the fourth quarter of 2014. The first ring of the Unit 2 containment vessel, which I will show you in a picture shortly, is scheduled to be placed during the second quarter of 2014.","On Slide 19, you can see a summary that outlines the on hook dates for these 4 module structures.","I would now like to discuss some recent activities at the site. Slide 20 presents an aerial view of the new nuclear site. In the center of the picture is the MAB or Module Assembly Building. To the right of the MAB, you can see Unit 2, and to left is Unit 3. Well, we are also making progress on the low-profile cooling towers along the bottom of the picture. I'll discuss the site in more detail shortly, but here, you can get a feel for the layout of the site, and you can see that things are really starting to take form.","On Slide 21, you can see the picture of Unit 2 Nuclear Island. As previously mentioned, during 2013, we completed the over-50-hour continuous pour of the Nuclear Island basemat, also referred to as first nuclear concrete. Then using the heavy lift derrick, we set the 500-ton CR-10 module on the basemat, as well as the containment vessel bottom head on the CR-10 module. The containment vessel will house numerous reactor system components, such as the reactor vessel, tightening steam generators and pressurizer. As you can see on the bottom right of the slide, work continues to form the concrete walls and other structures that comprise the Unit 2 Nuclear Island.","On Slide 22, you can see a picture across the top of the slide showing the successful pouring of the Nuclear Island basemat for Unit 3, which took place in November. Again, this basemat provides a foundation for the containment vessel, shield building and auxiliary building that make up the Nuclear Island for Unit 3. On the bottom left side of the slide, you can see the finished product of that pour. Currently, construction of the CR-10 module is taking place on the Unit 3 Nuclear Island basemat, as you can see on the bottom right of the slide.","On the top left of Slide 23, you can see a picture of the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head. Similar to Unit 2, this bottom head will be placed on the Nuclear Island, on top of the CR-10 module for Unit 3. On the top right of the same slide, you'll see the first containment vessel ring for Unit 2. As I mentioned earlier, this ring should be placed on top of the Unit 2 containment vessel bottom head during the second quarter of this year. Two pictures along the bottom of the slide show cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha. Both of these cooling towers are now structurally complete. All 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continue to progress as anticipated.","On Slide 24, you can see the schematic of the turbine building that illustrates how the various turbine building modules will look when complete. The modules that are highlighted in green have been placed in their final locations, with work continuing to progress for modules CA-81 Charlie and CH-82.","On Slide 25, you can see a picture of the Unit 2 turbine building. Comparing the schematic from the previous slide, you can see all of the previously mentioned modules in place on the turbine building basemat.","On Slide 26, you will see a few of the components that have arrived on-site. On the top left, you'll see a picture of the Unit 2 reactor vessel. This vessel is a thick-metal-clad stainless steel and houses fuel assemblies. On the top right, you will see Units 2 and 3 accumulator tanks on-site. These accumulator tanks are safety-related tanks that hold water and would be used to inject that water into the reactor vessel if they were -- if there happen to be a loss of pressure effect.","On the bottom left, you see 1 of 2 moisture separator reheaters being lifted with the heavy lift derrick. And moisture separator reheaters take steam coming out of the high-pressure turbine and super-heat that steam before it enters the low-pressure turbines to ensure that all -- that it's all steam and no water. On the bottom right, you will see the Unit 2 and Unit 3 core makeup tanks. Core makeup tanks contain boiled water and are a component of the passive cooling system that assists in safely shutting down the plant.","On Slide 27, you will see the new nuclear CapEx over the life of the construction. This chart shows the CWIP during the years 2008 to 2018 and has been updated using the fourth quarter of 2013 BLRA quarterly report, which we filed on February 11 of this month. As you can see, the next several years are considered the peak nuclear construction period. The green line represents the related projected customer rate increases under the Base Load Review Act. As Jimmy stated earlier, the 5% future acquisition will not affect these projected BLRA increases.","Please now turn to Slide 28. As we mentioned in our Third Quarter Call in September, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved an increase of $67.2 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30. Our BLRA filings for 2014 are shown at the bottom of the slide.","On Slide 29, you will see a breakout of total new nuclear project costs. On the far right, you can see our current projected costs as filed in the fourth quarter 2013 BLRA quarterly report. Project costs are down approximately $633 million from the original approved -- approval received from the Public Service Commission of South Carolina. As you can see, this change is largely attributable to lower escalation.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Wondering at the SCE&G, you talk about the non-nuclear. What's the primary thing that's holding back that earned return from the allowed return, that 100 basis points or so?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, Travis, it is the kind of headwind of just general consumption, non-weather-related consumption, really what's going on across the industry, occurring with us too with more efficient lightbulbs, more efficient HVAC, et cetera. So that's the -- that's kind of the large headwind that we're working against and offsetting it with cost control.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is there any point -- you've talked about customer growth, obviously, but demand growth slowing. Is there a point at which you see that demand growth stop slowing and perhaps start picking up again? Is there a trough point that you see in that region?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, it certainly does in the mid term. I don't have a point, a calendar point, to put on that now. But to draw you 2 points in time: In the short term here, we're expecting it about flat, slightly less than '14, 0.2% down, whereas in our longer-term IRP that's out there now, we're expecting something over 1% growth over a 15-year period. So I can't tell you exactly at what point that turns and in what year, but it -- we do see it turning in the long run.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jim von Riesemann of CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Before we get run over on all the nuclear questions, a couple of questions on my end. Jimmy, would you mind explaining this interest rate derivative, the uncollected fuel issue in a little bit more detail and kind of walk us through the geography on the income statement in the fourth quarter of '13 so we can think about our models in the future a little bit more clearly?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I'll be glad to. So what happens there, if you want to kind of gross the income statement back up absent this accounting, you basically need to add $50 million back to margins and remove $50 million from other income. So we took these interest rate hedges that were substantially in the money and went to the regulator and said, \"Hey, core to our strategy over this next nuclear -- 3 nuclear peak construction years is not having any other increases to bear on customers' rates, like fuel.\" And we are substantially in the money on these hedges because interest rates have risen. And instead of the customer getting the benefit over the next 30 years in lower interest rates related to the bonds where we've amortized the hedges, we'll cash them in and take all of the benefit back to the customer now by offsetting under-collected fuel costs, avoiding a potential fuel increase. So the regulator agreed to that. And there's a net $50 million of that that netted down margins and increased other income.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay, super. On Georgia retail, I know you guys have had some significant cold weather down there. Can you talk about what you've been experiencing in the first quarter thus far, and how your contracts work down there? Are you guys variable or fixed?","Jimmy E. Addison","So our customers' contracts with us are both. And I would say a slight majority of them now are in the fixed area compared to variable, which is consistent with the entire market based upon our understanding of it. So more customers are in fixed contracts with marketers that are in variable contracts. We -- if they're in a fixed contract, we have a financial hedge in place based on any contracts entered into in any 1 month that aggregates all of those contracts and plans for normal weather. So when there's more -- abnormal weather, abnormally cold, of course, we've got some financial risk associated with that, but we're very comfortable. I'm not going to get into forecasting January's earnings, but we're very comfortable that January will be a good financial month for the Georgia business.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then let me kick off the nuclear stuff. Your friends are a few miles to the south. Are you thinking about doing a nuclear loan or at -- get a loan guarantee? Or at least, that's what every press is -- press report is telling us. How are you guys thinking about nuclear loan guarantees from the government?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, nothing's changed on our side. We continue to provide our information to the DOE on a periodic basis to keep them updated on our information since we initiated the application several years ago. And if ultimately we believe there is some benefit for the customer in that arrangement, we'll -- we would examine possibly doing it, but at this point, we've not seen the benefits.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","Your guidance for this year, the $3.45 to $3.65, that's I guess based on kind of year end. Does it incorporate any weather in that pro-or-con?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's correct.","Andrew Levi","Like, whether it's upside or storms or anything like that.","Jimmy E. Addison","Right. The only thing I would say is that in our operating forecast, on the electric business, we do have in our operating cost a $2.5 million of potential costs that is basically deductible, if you will, before we can use our storm damage reserve. And based upon the experience to date, I can assure you we've exceeded that amount. So I'm glad we had that in our forecast.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So just explain that, I guess, real quick. So you have this $2.5 million deductible, which is in your forecast, but any incremental storm cost in South Carolina is covered through a clause or through insurance vote?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, so we have a storm damage reserve that we ceased adding to effective with the new base rates in the beginning of '13. But it has about $25 million in it at this point. So anything related to storms above the $2.5 million annually would go against that reserve. If we were to exceed the amount in the fund at this point, then we would simply defer that and go back to the regulator. Our agreement is, through the last settlement, we would go for some type of mechanism to get that recovered.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then I think, clearly, there's upside from the weather as far as temperatures and things like that, but then also I guess you had some outages as well. But net-net, would you think you're on the plus side there weather-wise?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. We did have outages. We had at the peak probably 140,000 customers out. That did not last very long, probably less than 1 day. We had them all back on within about 5 days or so. But we made a rough estimate of the actual revenue loss, and that's less than $1 million.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So net-net, weather should be a positive, and that's not incorporated in your guidance for 2014...","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, financially, it's a positive. It's a heck of a way to get there with all that the states have been through in last week, though.","Andrew Levi","Right. No, no, I get that. It's not good for the customers at all. And then just on the Georgia side, how should we kind of think about that just at a very high level? I just remember, when we had the warm winter, there was a financial hit. Now we've had a really cold winter. So how should we kind of think about that business relative to what's the norm? Because your earnings are fairly consistent there.","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, what I would say is January is 1 of about 5 important months for the Georgia business. We're in the middle of February now. It's 82 degrees today. So we're not selling a lot of gas in Atlanta and the surrounding areas. So we -- I think we'll have a very good month in January, my gut feel. February, with part of it cold in the early part of the month, and now it's in the 80s, we'll have to wait and see what the rest of the month brings. But there are really 5: January, February, March, November, December all are key to that business. So we're only 20% of the way through the real earnings season for 2014 for Georgia.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Weinstein [ph] of UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It's Julien here, actually. Could you elaborate a little bit on the service delay costs, what the latest is there? And perhaps to the extent of which timing, do have any sense as to when this all might come to a head, if you will?","Jimmy E. Addison","You're talking about new nuclear?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, on the new nuclear, the $200 million.","Stephen A. Byrne","$200 million? Yes, I think what you heard us say today was that we're reaffirming that we still think that value is good and that that's still our number, not a consortium number. But we are anticipating that the consortium is going to go through another estimate at completion through this spring and summer. And sometime perhaps third quarter- or fourth quarter-ish of this year, I would anticipate that they will give us an estimate that will include anything that they see from that delay from receiving the modules, and that will start our negotiations at that point.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And how long would that take just so you could kind of continue running out the...","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, I'd be -- I'm loathe to give you a time estimate. Our experience with negotiating with the consortium is that things take a long time but it's worthwhile in the end. And then we've got an almost completely new management team in at CB&I and a lot of new folks at Westinghouse since the last time we went through one of these kind of negotiations, which would have been with their predecessor, Shaw. So it will take a while. Now whether that's a quarter, 2 quarters, 3 quarters, I don't know what I could tell you that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right. And could you just elaborate a little bit more on the shift? It looks like some of the CapEx that you were intending to spend in '13 moved out to '14 and '15. Could you just talk a little bit more about that?","Stephen A. Byrne","Yes, I think what we're looking at now is that, at our last quarterly call, we were estimating spending about $897 million in '14. We're now looking at some of the money from '13 moving into '14, so that's now increased by about $53 million in '14. Then that's largely a compression of the schedule. So when the end date stays the same and they don't spend as much in '13, it's going to push into '14 and '15. So the '14 number looks like about an additional $53 million. So when the consortium doesn't hit milestones, and they get paid based on milestones, we withhold payment.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you, excellent. And then lastly, could you just comment quickly? You comment briefly in your remarks about the additional 100 or so megawatts. Is that it in sort of for the time being in terms of ultimate ownership? If you could talk maybe about a long term? Is there a desire for more, or how this negotiation ultimately happened in your mind in terms of desire to take down more of the plant?","Stephen A. Byrne","You know what, it's the -- our desire really was based on the desire of our partner, Santee Cooper, to divest of some of their ownership percentage. I think their appetite to sell off some of their piece has diminished over the last couple of years. At one point in time, I think they were talking about a much higher percentage. And it looks like the 5% that we're going to take is satisfying their desire to divest of some of their ownership percentage. So I don't foresee that changing. I think that the 5% that we've agreed to purchase, pending the regulatory approvals, at least at this point in time, is it.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And then from a seasonal perspective, the approvals, how long is that they're going to take here? I mean, how does that mesh into everything, if you will? Is there any kind of key date we should be bearing in mind there?","Stephen A. Byrne","No, nothing key. The really -- the ball is in the court of us to pull that together and go to the ORS and ultimately to the commission. And we would expect to do that sometime later this year, but there's no key requirement or time frame around it.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of just nuts-and-bolts item, and then one for Steve on the nuclear project. Jimmy, just real quick, on the gas RSA, what are you kind of expecting about -- for that in terms of potential rate revenue changes at the back end of the year?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, well, as we have on one of our slides there, the business has earned -- at this point, we're earning up in the 10.6%, 10.7% range, something like that. So that's in the upper end of the 50 basis point band. And the real contributor to that is the cost-control efforts we've had across the enterprise. And so -- and as well as really good growth in the gas system. So those new customers using more gas, with the growth, has really helped keep that return up. To me, it's really a kind of a high-class problem to have. We're likely in the situation where we'll not have an RSA increase this fall, but that's because we're earning the returns and we're controlling cost increases. And therefore, the -- we're running the business at the allowed return. So I really don't see a lot changing in that RSA.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And so you -- basically, you don't assume there's a gas rate increase at SCE&G. And it doesn't strike me there's a general rate case process or much happening on the PSC -- PSNC side. Am I thinking about both of the gas businesses kind of correctly there from a revenue requirement change?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I would certainly say that's the case for the next 12 months.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then O&M, I want to make sure I understood. You made a comment about expect O&M roughly up 3% year-over-year. Just curious what's driving that. You all have a pretty good history of, I want to say, giving an initial O&M level and then coming in and beating it, and give credit to you guys for doing that. But just kind of curious what's driving -- given we're in a low inflationary environment right now, what's kind of driving that change in the year-over-year O&M?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, I think it's -- if you look at our actual results, they've been basically flat in the last couple of years now, realizing on the face of the financials that '13's actuals are up about 2.5%. But I said in the earlier comments, all of that was really driven off rate case amortization. So despite wage increases, increases from contractors, et cetera, we were able to hold our real costs flat other than those amortizations that flow through. You can only do that so long. If you look across all of our customer base, over the last couple of years, we've added about 30,000 customers in all 3 states combined. We're serving them with 200 fewer employees today outside of the folks that Steve's hiring in new nuclear. So we've done a really good job of holding that back for a while. We got to make sure in the longer run that we balance that against and don't cause damage to the customer service, reliability or safety, and we're just looking at balancing that.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And now that you don't have weather normalization now at SCE&G on the electric side, you still have it on the gas side. And is it on the gas side for both businesses, or just the SCE&G side?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes, it's on both gas LDCs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, Steve, on -- in the BLRA filing, there was a little bit of discussion about issues or concerns, really more issues with the reactor coolant pump and piping. And can you just kind of rehash for us, what actually is a reactor coolant pump and the piping that goes in it? And what are the some of the issues or concerns that you touched on in the BLRA?","Stephen A. Byrne","Sure. The way the reactor coolant system works is that the fuel rods are there really to make heat, and then the reactor coolant system water will move that heat and it carries it to a steam generator where we make steam with a secondary source of water. So our water never boils, it stays liquid, and we will then pump it right back from the steam generator to the reactor vessel. So it just makes a big loop. And on the bottom of the steam generators, in order to pump it back to the reactor vessel, we have 2 reactor coolant pumps. And these are new to the commercial nuclear industry type pumps. So they've been used for decades in military applications, like the Navy. So these are big canned rotor pumps. When they get the bugs worked out, I think they're going to be much, much better than the previous version of reactor coolant pumps, but they are working through some of those bugs. So there's a lot of testing that's going on, particularly for the projects in China. And as they're going through those China checkouts or tests, they're finding some issues...","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And can you -- and what kind of -- when you say issues, I mean, are we talking operational issues? Or are we talking kind of the stuff like getting the materials delivered to your site on-time and on-schedule?","Stephen A. Byrne","No, no. We're talking about operational issues found during the test. We don't have any issues that we're aware of with the supply chain or getting them delivered to the site. But they've had some issues with some bearings that have been overheating. That's going to entail bearing redesigns and those kind of things. Not overly concerned about those. The do have one issue with some parts of the in-power [ph], which is the motor force on this pump that drives the water. Some repairs were made to some of those for the China project that created loose parts. And we've discovered that we did not go through the same process, so we shouldn't expect the same kinds of loose parts. So there's kind of checkout issues on the reactor coolant pumps. And I believe that the pressure being exerted on the supplier by the Chinese will solve the problems for us.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question will come from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","I wanted to elaborate. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit on Julien's question about the timing of the nuclear CapEx. I understand that some of the dollars that you expected to pay in '13 spilled into '14. But if I look at the BLRA from last week, it looks like there was also a pretty big pickup in '15 as well as '16, and then reductions in the outer years. So am I right in reading that, that the spending almost got compressed even further into the peak years?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. So here is the situation: If you -- let's look at it on the a mid-year basis since that's the way the BLRA filings happen, based on the CWIP that's expended through mid year. So what we forecast is that the -- that through midyear-2014, we'll be down $164 million compared to what we had earlier expected, and we will pick that up in '15, '16 and '17. So it's just kind of a skewing to the right of the same dollars. There's no real change in the dollars overall related to this. But the $164 million lower in '14, add 96 in '15, 43 in '16, 45 in '17 and about $18 million less in 2018. So it's just a change of the distribution.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, great. And then one other question. This is just sort of a -- maybe I'm misreading something in the press releases, but when I -- every quarter, you detail how many customers you have for the electric and gas utilities. And the numbers I'm calculating are very different from what you're reporting. So when I compare this press release versus the one a year ago, I'm showing about 0.66% increase in the customer count versus you're reporting a number significantly higher. You're basically showing almost 2% on an average basis. Is there anything that would cause the year-ago numbers to somehow be restated? Was there any reclassification?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, there's no reclassification, there's no restatement or anything of that nature. So it should be period-end data compared to the period end a year ago. So we've got -- I'm looking at it here now. We have 675,000 electric, 325,000 gas in South Carolina and just over 500,000 gas in North Carolina. And that yields 1.2%, 2.1% and 2.3%, respectively.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Okay, maybe I'll follow up offline, but I just want to clarify the -- when you talk about similar growth in '14 that you saw in '13 on the customer counts, you are talking about those numbers that you just described, right, like the almost 2% on average?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's exactly right.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Addison for his closing remarks.","Jimmy E.

Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Byron Hinson, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Byron W. Hinson","Thank you, and welcome to our earnings conference call, including those who are joining us on the webcast. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, Chairman and CEO of SCANA; Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Kevin will make opening comments and Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results, economic development in our service territory, regulatory activity and earnings guidance for 2013. Additionally, Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After those comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and the earnings release referred to in this call are available at SCANA.com.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin B. Marsh","Thanks, Byron, and I'll begin on Slide 3. SCANA had a very good year in 2012, both financially and operationally, and Jimmy and Steve will speak to those accomplishments in just a few minutes. Like most businesses, we had plenty of opportunities and challenges during the year to keep our team busy. Early in the year, we developed and then executed a multifaceted strategy to overcome the challenges of the extremely mild weather that impacted our natural gas marketing business in Georgia. Additionally, the new nuclear team received our combined operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and made substantive progress on the construction of the 2 new plants.","Last year, we completed a comprehensive analysis of each business unit through our robust, strategic planning process that allows our management team to focus on significant issues and to execute. One example of a positive outcome of the strategic planning process is our decision to consolidate the leadership of all our regulated natural gas operations under one leader. Rusty Harris, who previously served as President of PSNC Energy in North Carolina, is now leading this combined group as President of SCANA's natural gas operations. You may remember Rusty from our Analyst Day presentations last year.","As a company, our strong financial and operational results are reflected in our total return to shareholders, which outperformed the majority of our peers in 2012. Yesterday, we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate, further contributing to shareholder return.","Several years ago, I was on the earnings call when we announced we were lowering our growth rate. We monitored the economic impact of the recession over the last 24 months, and we're more confident in the economic environment today than we were in 2011. Unemployment in our service area has improved by nearly 200 basis points, and customer growth also continues to improve. As a result, today I am pleased to tell you that we are increasing our growth rate. As Jimmy will discuss shortly, we are raising the upper band of our long-term growth rate from 5% to 6%. Our new growth target will therefore be 3% to 6% over a 3- to 5-year period, reflecting our more optimistic view while acknowledging some volatility in margin growth. We are now focused on executing our 2013 plan to achieve this goal.","Jimmy and Steve will now lead you through a discussion of our 2012 results and areas of focus for 2013. Obviously, one of our primary areas of focus will continue to be our new nuclear project. We are entering a period of peak construction spending, and focusing on successful execution will continue to be paramount. I'm confident we have a qualified team in place that will be able to bring this project to completion. Another area of focus for the next few years will be managing our base electric business, with a goal of no request for base rate increases until peak nuclear construction is behind us.","I'll now turn the call over to Jimmy, who will discuss our 2012 results.","Jimmy E. Addison","Thanks, Kevin, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 4. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012 were $0.79 per share compared to $0.76 per share in the same quarter of 2011. Higher electric and gas margins, as well as proceeds from the sale of communications towers, partially offset by increases in operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation and dilution. The increase in operating and maintenance expense was primarily due to higher incentive compensation and generation expenses. As I've mentioned previously, incentive compensation levels were abnormally low in 2011 due to stock performance and the fact that we did not meet our internal earnings target for the year. In 2012, we outperformed most of our peer group and exceeded our internal earnings target, resulting in the accrual of additional at-risk incentive comp.","Generation-related expenses were somewhat higher due largely to changes in the O&M and fuel allocation mix at our biomass facility. We also had termination fees related to the change in the third-party administrator for our health plan in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on Slide 5, for the full year, our GAAP basic earnings were $3.20 per share. There are several factors which should be considered as you review our 2012 earnings and look forward to 2013.","First, I would like to review the weather impact. 2012 marked the warmest year on record in the U.S. We experienced $0.11 per share of abnormal weather in 2012 comprised of $0.10 in Georgia in the first and fourth quarters, as well as $0.01 in the first quarter at SCE&G. As Kevin said, we recognized early on that weather in Georgia was going to be a challenge, but we remained committed to meeting our earnings target. It took several actions, including the sales of several well-subscribed telecommunications towers, as we do in the normal course of business from time to time. These sales of those towers contributed a gain of approximately $0.04 per share. We also reduced our forecasted spending, which contributed an additional $0.05 to the bottom line. The year-over-year increase in O&M is due to factors we discussed earlier: incentive comp, generation expenses and termination fees associated with health care. As a result of these actions and stronger-than-expected margin growth, we were able to more than offset the impact of weather.","Now on Slide 6, I'd like to briefly review results for our principal lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's full year 2012 earnings were up $0.23 compared to 2011, driven largely by base rate increases under the Base Load Review Act and the Gas Rate Stabilization Act, along with customer growth. These increases were partially offset by increases in operation and maintenance expenses, interest and depreciation expenses, and share dilution. For the fourth quarter, SCE&G's earnings were $0.04 higher than the same period last year, reflecting the aforementioned margin increases. PSNC Energy's earnings for 2012 were $0.38 per share compared to $0.37 per share in 2011. Increased margins from customer growth were somewhat offset by higher operating and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Fourth quarter 2012 earnings were flat over the same period in 2011. SCANA Energy reported lower earnings for the year and quarter primarily driven by the abnormally mild weather as I discussed earlier. SCANA's Corporate and other businesses for 2012 reported a gain of $0.05 per share compared to a loss of $0.01 per share in 2011. The increase is largely due to the sale of telecommunications towers as mentioned previously.","Next, I would like to touch on sales growth as shown on Slide 7. Weather-normalized sales volumes have shown promise, particularly in the latter half of 2012. For the year ended December 31, 2012, total weather-normalized electric sales to residential and commercial customers were up approximately 2.4% and 1.7%, respectively. Industrial sales were down approximately 1.7%, primarily due to reduced production at one of our largest customers as a result of a fire, as we discussed in prior quarters. This customer was brought back online on October. Were this customer's operations consistent with 2011, we estimate industrial sales would have increased approximately 1.4%, while total weather-normalized retail sales would have increased approximately 2%. Of the total retail sales growth, approximately 2\/3 was from increased usage, while 1\/3 was attributable to new customers.","On Slide 8, you will find information about economic trends in our service territories. We continue to be encouraged by the level of economic development activity with approximately $1.6 billion announced investment in our Carolina territories this year.","Census data also shows a positive trend in domestic population migration for our service territories. Of the 4 census graphic -- geographic regions, the South region saw significantly greater domestic population migration growth. In fact, more than 10x the growth of any other region. South Carolina, North Carolina and Georgia are all among the top 10 states in population growth, signifying that more people are relocating to the Southeast and more importantly, into our service territories, which leads to customer growth. Over the last year, customer growth has trended higher in our electric business, as well as in our regulated gas businesses in South and in North Carolina. As of December 2012, those rates were 0.9% for electric, 1.8% for SCE&G gas, and 2% for PSNC. SCE&G gas had its best growth rate since 2007 and PSNC had 2 linked quarters of 2% customer growth.","Please turn to Slide 9, which sets forth our regulated rate base and returns. The bar graph on the left presents the components of our regulated rate base of over $7.6 billion. As you can see from the items denoted in the 2 shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is composed of SCE&G electric. Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. Public Service of North Carolina continues to earn a strong return due to customer growth in its territory and stable margins under the customer utilization tracker mechanism. The return on the regulated gas business in South Carolina reflects the November rate increase of $7.5 million under the Rate Stabilization Act. We also continued to see the expected returns on the new nuclear project under the BLRA.","As we've mentioned previously, a strategic goal for 2013 and beyond will be to manage our base retail electric business to prevent the need for base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years of 2013 through 2015. Control of O&M and non-new nuclear CapEx, while monitoring and responding to margin fluctuations, will be essential to achieving this goal. As you're all aware, in late December, the PSC issued an order approving an overall increase in retail electric revenues of approximately $97 million with an allowed ROE of 10.25%. We anticipate this rate increase will have a net income impact of approximately $26 million in 2013. These new rates were effective on January 1, 2013.","We will file our quarterly surveillance report for SCE&G electric with the Commission in mid-March. We estimate the regulatory retail electric ROE for the 12 months ended December 2012 is approximately 10%. We continue to fine-tune our strategy with a goal of managing this business so that we earn a reasonable return while not requesting a base rate increase during this period of peak nuclear construction.  The bottom of the slide includes a timeline depicting our regulatory filing schedule for 2013 outside of the new nuclear project. These planned activities are standard annual filings. As you can see in the timeline, we have completed our annual demand side management filing and we'll be submitting our integrated resource plan shortly.","Slide 10 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast reflects new nuclear spending as reported in our latest BLRA quarterly report filed on February 13 and reflects our new CapEx budget for 2013 through 2015. On the bottom of the slide, you can see our anticipated incremental nuclear CWIP as of June 30. This represents the incremental CWIP from July 1 through June 30 for each period on which the BLRA increase is calculated. Our projected nuclear spend has not changed substantially since the last public version of this slide. The projection for capital spending at our North Carolina LDC and in our gas transmission business has increased to accommodate growth in both of these subsidiaries. Spending at SCE&G has remained largely consistent with the previous CapEx schedule we presented, with increases in our generation, transmission and distribution categories being partially offset with decreases in other categories.","Please turn to Slide 11 to review our financing plan. As a result of a shift in our nuclear spending, as shown in the Q3 and Q4 BLRA filings, coupled with the extension of bonus depreciation into 2013, we have pushed approximately $275 million of additional equity from 2013 to 2014. We are committed to drawing the remaining funds from our equity forward contract during the first quarter of this year, resulting in the issuance of approximately 6.6 million shares. We expect this equity from the forward, in addition to the $100 million from the employee stock and other DRIP plans to meet our needs for 2013, further minimizing dilution. The blue box denotes our estimate of the additional equity needed to complete nuclear construction. Of course, the amounts and timing could change due to a change in inflation, bonus depreciation, the construction schedule or other factors.","I would also like to touch briefly on our pension plan. I'm pleased to report that our pension plan remains adequately funded. We have not had to make a cash contribution to the plan since 1997, and do not anticipate any such contributions until after 2014. In addition, we are now largely insulated from the earnings impact of changes in pension costs as a result of the implementation of a pension cost recovery rider as part of our latest electric rate case.","Slide 12 presents our 2013 earnings guidance and related assumptions. As Kevin mentioned earlier, we have increased the upper band of our long-term target growth rate from 5% to 6%. Therefore, our new target will be 3% to 6% over a 3- to 5-year period, based on 2012 GAAP basic earnings per share of $3.20. This increase represents our projected earnings momentum driven by our BLRA filings, our stated goal to manage retail electric returns and our view of the economy, balanced with our assumption of the impacts of the phase-in of the CFL lightbulbs and other efficiency standards.","Our 2013 guidance is $3.25 to $3.45 per share, and our internal target is $3.35. Typically, we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in each of the first and third quarters, approximately 25% in the fourth quarter, and the remainder in the second. In computing this guidance range, we have included the impact of base rate increases from our new nuclear filings under the BLRA, the 2012 gas RSA filing and the retail electric base rate increase that took effect on January 1. This guidance also assumes drawing the funds under our equity forward contracts in the first quarter of 2013, and incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier.","Additionally, while we anticipate the number of customers will continue to increase, our assumption of customer average use of electricity is lower next year considering the aforementioned energy efficiency impacts. We anticipate overall retail sales growth for 2013 to be slightly less than 0.5%. We forecast customer growth to be in a similar range to 2012.","We expect operating and maintenance expenses to be approximately 2.5% higher in 2013, excluding bad debt expense and specific O&M expense increases associated with the recent rate case, since those have already been considered in the anticipated $26 million net income impact we previously provided. If you were to include rate case and bad debt expenses, O&M would grow at approximately double the 2.5% rate. The largest driver of rate case expenses is the recognition of pension expense in 2013. While this increase will be offset with additional revenue via a rider, it will cost the O&M line item to increase on the face of the financials. In regards to non-rate case O&M, approximately 1\/3 of the expected increase is due to deferred items from 2012.","Some of the other items driving the increase include amortization of program costs from our demand side management program, which are offset with increased electric margin and increased reliability related costs. We also expect continued growth in the CapEx related cost of property taxes, depreciation and interest. Also, our effective tax rate for 2012 was approximately 30% and we estimate the rate for 2013 will be approximately 32%. Our lower effective tax rate for the last couple of years has reflected the amortization of previously deferred state investment tax credits, and that amortization ran its course during 2012. The higher effective rate was considered in our most recent electric rate case. In addition, we've seen a fundamental shift in the Georgia market. The business has really matured during the last decade, resulting in thinner margins and enhanced competition for customers. As a result, we estimate earnings in Georgia will be slightly lower prospectively, and in the range of approximately $0.18 to $0.20 per share.","Keeping in mind our internal target of $3.35, let's discuss the potential upsides and downsides to our 2013 earnings range. There are several factors that could cause us to trend towards the lower end of our guidance. We continue to see fluctuations in average use. While we were pleased with usage in 2012, we believe that there's uncertainty around average use. And as a result, we have forecasted average use to be slightly lower in 2013. Average use could come in even lower than forecast due to higher CFL bulb adoption rates. Customer growth continues to be a bright spot in our service territory. We are currently forecasting an increase similar to 2012. However, there is the possibility that customer growth comes in lower than expected. And as you are all aware, many American households have seen a reduction in take-home pay in 2013 due to the recent expiration of the payroll tax holiday. Lower discretionary income could impact customer spending. In addition, gasoline prices are already increasing, which could further impact discretionary spending, particularly in our service territories, where customers typically drive personal vehicles to and from work. Additionally, if nuclear spending were to slow down or shift to later years, it would negatively impact our earnings potential for 2013.","In contrast, there are several factors that could push it toward the upper end of our guidance. If average use were to increase at 2012 levels or better or if customer growth accelerates beyond 2012 levels, we could have potential upside. Hopefully, this will provide you with a line of sight into our view of 2013 as you update your own models.  And finally, I want to mention our upcoming Analyst Day event to be held in New York on June 5. Please mark your calendars and plan to attend.","I'll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Stephen A. Byrne","Thanks, Jimmy. I'd now like to direct your attention to Slide 13. Construction continues to progress at our nuclear site in Jenkinsville, South Carolina. The project maintains an excellent safety record and has seen good coordination between the various contractor companies on-site. The schedule continues to support commercial operation dates in 2017 for Unit 2 and 2018 for Unit 3.","On the top left of the slide, you can see a picture of the switchyard. Switchyard was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2012 and was energized for testing this year. At top right, you will see a picture of Cooling Tower 2 Alpha. Progress on all 4 of the low-profile forced draft cooling towers continues to progress as anticipated. On the bottom left, you'll see the Unit 2 Turbine Building. Turbine Building basemat for Unit 2 is substantially complete and we are starting vertical construction. At bottom right, you'll see a picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island, rock cleaning and form work have been completed and leveling concrete has been poured. The lower and upper mud mats, along with the waterproof membrane will be installed in the coming months.","Slide 14 is a picture of the Unit 2 Nuclear Island. As you may have noticed, in January, we filed a License Amendment Request or LAR and a Preliminary Amendment Request or PAR, with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reflect changes in the license design as it relates to reinforcing bar in the Nuclear Island basemat. The proposed changes reflect a modification to the American Concrete Institute code section referenced in the design from Section 349 to Section 318. The use of this code section requires relatively minor changes to the rebar and to the thickness of the concrete in the areas below the elevator pits and the sump.","In January, we received a No Objection letter from the NRC staff on the path laid out in the PAR. At that point, we began work on the reinforcing bar reconfiguration, allowing us to prepare for the nuclear concrete pour upon receipt of the LAR. We're optimistic that we will receive the LAR in the first quarter. We don\u2019t expect this issue to impact the commercial operation dates for the 2 units.","As you may have noticed in our most recent BLRA filing, we have filed 7 LARs to date and anticipate that there will be more throughout the course of the project. I wanted to bring to your attention that these filings are relatively routine and are a normal part of the nuclear licensing process. Not only are they filed for new nuclear construction, but they are routine in all nuclear facilities, including our V.C. Summer Unit #1. These filings were made periodically throughout the construction of our new nuclear build.","Overall, the fabrication of equipment off-site is proceeding on a schedule that supports the commercial operation date of the units. The components of the condenser for Unit 2 have arrived on-site and are being assembled. Manufacturing and testing of the reactor vessel for Unit 2, as seen on Slide 15, is nearing completion and shipment is planned for the second quarter of 2013. Steam generators for Unit 2 are also scheduled to be delivered in 2013. However, the schedule for fabrication of the sub-modules from a Shaw Modular Solutions facility in Lake Charles, Louisiana, remains a focus area for the project. Senior management from SCE&G, Shaw and Westinghouse continue to actively provide oversight, and we continue to see improvement in the fabrication and delivery process related to the sub-modules.","Progress at the Sanmen plant in China, which is building the AP1000 design, is going well, as you can see on Slide 16. In January, they successfully set the containment vessel top head, which you can still see attached to the large blue crane. All major equipment has been installed and the welding of the main cooling piping is in process. We congratulate them on their achievements and look forward to accomplishing the same milestones.","Slide 17 gives you a visual representation of the sections of the containment vessel. You can see that the top head, which Sanmen just set -- the containment vessel is approximately 215 feet tall, 130 feet in diameter and weighs about 7 million pounds. The containment vessel is assembled in 5 main sections: the bottom head, 3 ring sections and the top head. Each section is assembled and welded from individual steel plates that are shipped to the site from sub-vendors, where they have been rolled, formed, cut and beveled.","On Slide 18, you can see the progress that has been made on the fabrication of the containment vessel for Unit 2. The on-site fabrication by Chicago Bridge & Iron is steadily progressing. They have worked on the rings that attach the completed bottom head and which will form the vertical walls of the containment vessel containers.","On Slide 19, we review our new nuclear Base Load Review Act filings and related rate increases. In September of last year, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved a rate increase of $52 million. These new rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30. We continue to be pleased that the mechanism is working as designed. Our BLRA filings for 2013 are shown at the bottom of the slide. As you can see, our next quarterly status report will be filed in May, and we will make our annual request for revised rates under the BLRA in May as well.","Information on Slide 20 reflects the expected rate increases for our nuclear project through 2015. As you can see, the amount for 2013 is lower than the number previously provided in May of last year, due largely to the shift of CapEx as discussed in our third quarter 2012 BLRA report and the escalation associated with that shift. The amounts for 2014 and 2015 are largely unchanged. We will adjust these numbers in May when we make our request for revised rates, but we wanted to give you a sense of our current expectations.","That concludes our prepared remarks. We will now be glad to respond to any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Adam Muro of Goldman Sachs.","Adam Muro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Adam Muro here, subbing in for Michael and Neil. Just curious, the Vogtle plant under construction by Georgia Power recently faced a challenge of the railcar used to get the reactor vessel from the port to the plant site was not big enough, creating some logistical issues. I mean, just curious on whether this impacts your construction project. If so, how, and what can be done to remedy this?","Stephen A. Byrne","This is Steve. The railcar that was used to transport the reactor vessel from the Port of Savannah to the Vogtle site,  I didn't understand that it was undersized but the load did shift in transit not far out of the Port of Savannah. The vendor, in this case it's Westinghouse, along with the railcar vendor, are redesigning that car. We don\u2019t anticipate that it's going to have any impact on our delivery schedule. We don't need our reactor vessel on the site until sometime next year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Travis Miller of Morningstar.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just discuss your dividend policy and ability to increase the dividend in line with your targeted earnings growth rate, particularly given the amount of capital expenditure you have coming up?","Jimmy E. Addison","Sure. Well our policy is 55% to 60% payout ratio. And we got a little ahead of that, not due to dividend growth, but due to a pullback in earnings at the beginning of the recession a few years ago. And we presented a plan to our board about 3 years ago. They took the third step in that plan yesterday, which we published. And that is to continue to grow dividends, but grow them at a lesser rate than the earnings growth so that we get back inside the top end of that payout ratio. So we're very close to it now, I think based on our proposed guidance for '13, we're just slightly over 60%. So we would expect to be able to continue to grow it until we're completely inside of that range at a slightly lower rate than earnings growth, and then we would expect the dividend growth to be fairly consistent with earnings growth.","Travis Miller - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. If you could provide a little color on the expected difference between the retail sales guidance of roughly 0.5% compared to 2% for 2012 if you include the customer outage. Is that all just due to higher efficiency rates?","Jimmy E. Addison","It principally is. And we've expected our actual number of customers added, new customers added to the system would be very similar in 2013 to 2012, that's our planning assumption. At least we based it off of what we had experienced through Q3. When we put our plan together, of course, Q4 accelerated just slightly above that from 0.6% to 0.9%. So most of the kind of dampening of it is our expectation of these efficiency standards. And there's kind of no question that this is coming with these CFL bulbs principally. The question -- the very difficult part for all of us is exactly when does it work through and how much of it comes through. So we've assumed it comes in over 3 to 4 years, and becomes completely saturated. But frankly, we don't know what kind of inventories are out there in folks' homes of incandescent bulbs that they can use over time. So that's the biggest factor.","Operator","The next question will be from Andy Levi of Avon Capital.","Andrew Levi","I'm sorry if you've talked about this in your formal comments, I've just been hopping around calls here. But what was -- what prompted you to take the high end of your growth rate up to 6%, which we were happy to see?","Kevin B. Marsh","Yes, Andy, this is Kevin. We've had these discussions on the calls, I think ever since we lowered the rate, as to when we might be able to move it back up. We talked last year and we watched carefully as we tried to figure out exactly what was going on in the economy. We saw glimpses of movement both in the customer usage, as well as the growth rate. We hadn't seen anything that we felt like was more of a trend until we got towards the end of the year. Based on our analysis, I guess we would say we see a light at the end of the tunnel now rather than a flicker, and we felt confident raising that top end combined with the growth we expect to see from the Base Load Review Act increases. But we still a left a 3% on the bottom end just in case the economy does take a turn on us or we see more of an impact from the CFLs that Jimmy talked about earlier. But I think just all in all, it's a little firmer confidence from our feeling of what the opportunities are and the growth we see in the population in South Carolina, as well as just a more continuous stream of average usage going up rather than being up 1 month and down the next month. We see that a little more consistent.","Andrew Levi","And I think you probably mentioned this, too, and I probably missed it. So you moved the equity out a year, which you had scheduled to do for '13. Was that a function of bonus depreciation or what was the reason for that?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. Andy, it's really a function of several things. But one, I would say the inflation on the overall project continues to be less than we had expected. Project to date now, it's about $600 million less total projected escalation or inflation on the project than we had planned at the outset when it was approved. Hence, the overall projected cost is now down from $6.3 billion to about $5.7 billion. And if -- you know our strategy is 50-50 debt and equity financing, so half of that comes from equity, so that's kind of a permanent dampering on the need for equity. And then bonus depreciation certainly contributed some to that, as well as some of the just -- better results on customer growth and customer usage. The retained earnings as a part of that helps offset it, too. [indiscernible] Sorry, to finish up, we will take down the equity forward here next month before the end of the first quarter, and that's $200 million from the deal we did back in 2010 and that keeps us in good shape.","Andrew Levi","And what was the benefit -- what's going to be the benefit of bonus depreciation in '13?","Jimmy E. Addison","I think we estimate it to be maybe $80 million or something in that ballpark.","Andrew Levi","Okay. So basically, you're below budget and on schedule on the nukes, pretty good.","Andrew Levi","That's right.","Operator","The next question will be from Andrew Weisel of Macquarie Capital.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. I guess, just the one last one I'll add is, the 3% to 6% using $3.20 as a base, that's 3% to 6% is basic earnings per share growth?","Jimmy E. Addison","That's right.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","So what might that look like on a diluted basis, as these issuances come out and as the share count changes over time?","Jimmy E. Addison","Well, the dilutive effect, at least prospectively, will be eliminated once we take this forward down next month. So that dilution calculation will require to use that treasury method just like you would you be for options or something of that nature. But it's not like an option in executive comp where it's not the company's option as to when it happens, it's the individual's option. This is always -- we were the driver of it. I've been a little frustrated with the dilutive calculation related to the forward because it's such as theoretical animal, but I really haven't computed it going forward. There'll be some tail period until it works out of the historical calculations, but it will not be applicable prospectively.","Andrew M. Weisel - Macquarie Research","Sure, that makes perfect sense. And similarly, the 2013 guidance, again, that's basic but dilutive probably won't look too different, is that a fair assumption?","Jimmy E. Addison","Yes. I think that's a fair assumption.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from John Alli at Decade Capital.","John Alli","I apologize, but I was hopping on just as you guys were starting the commentary around the dividend growth. I was wondering if you might just be able to recap that quickly?","Jimmy E. Addison","Sure. Well, our policy is 55% to 60% payout, so we've been a little over our policy statement the last few years just due to the pullback in earnings around the recession. So the strategy that we've recommended and our board's endorsed over the last 3 years has been to grow dividends at the smaller rate than earnings growth to get back within that cap. So we're almost back there now. Growth rate on the dividend was about 2.5% this year, higher than the last couple of years, but still smaller than the earnings growth rate of about 6%. So we're about back where we need to be. And once we're completely inside that cap, we would expect to grow dividends fairly consistently with earnings. Now there may be some years when earnings are a little lumpy with rate increases and things like that, and we intend to take a longer-term view on dividends to kind of flatten some of that out.","John Alli","Great. Any color on the timing of the '14 equity?","Jimmy E. Addison","No, not at this point. I mean, we'll continue to monitor the project construction. We'll continue to monitor what Congress might do. I mean, hey, they could come up with some more bonus depreciation or something like that, so I really don't have anything specific at this point. And we need to watch what inflation does as well because if it continues to come down, that could haircut some of the total amount and the timing of when this is needed.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Marsh for his closing comments.","Kevin B. Marsh","Thank you. Let me summarize by saying we are pleased with the results for 2012. The abnormal weather during the year presented some challenges for us, but I was pleased with the management team as they rose to meet that challenge and their efforts resulted in a strong finish for the year. Our nuclear construction continues to progress, as Steve discussed, and although we have some challenges, we continue to focus on bringing the 2 new plants online during 2017 and 2018, respectively.","Thanks for joining us today and for your continuing interest in SCANA.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation conference call. [Operator Instructions As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, October 26, 2017. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Iris Griffin, Vice President of Finance.","Iris Griffin","Thank you, and welcome to our analyst call. As you know, earlier today, we announced financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Joining us on the call today are Kevin Marsh, SCANA's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer.","During the call, Kevin will provide an update on the regulatory and legislative process surrounding our decision to abandon construction of VC Summer Units 2 and 3. Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. The slides and earnings release referred to in this call are available at scana.com.","Before I turn the call over to Kevin, I would like to remind you that certain statements that may be made during today's call are considered forward-looking statements and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as shown on Slide 2. The company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements.","Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found in the Investors section of our website under Webcasts & Presentations.","I'll now turn the call over to Kevin.","Kevin Marsh","Thanks, Iris, and thank you all for joining us today. I'd like to begin our discussion on Slide 3 with an update on activities associated with our decision to abandon the new nuclear project.","As I have said before, the decision to stop work on the project was always our least desired option. However, it was the right decision for our customers based on the impact of the bankruptcy of Westinghouse, their refusal to honour their fixed-price contract as well as the withdrawal of our project partner, Santee Cooper. Top of the slide lays out some of the events that have transpired over the last few months. We have appeared before special committees of both the South Carolina Senate and House of Representatives to explain the details of our project and the evaluation which was the basis of our decision to abandon the project.","We hope to work with the legislature and other parties to develop a reasonable and comprehensive settlement of the issues relating to the abandonment decision. Our focus is on finding a solution that mitigates the cost impact on customers while positioning the company to continue to be able to serve our customers and meet the state's growing electric demands.","At the end of September, the Office of Regulatory Staff filed a petition with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina requesting that the commission issue an order directing SCE&G to immediately suspend the collection of revised rates currently being collected under the Base Load Review Act. SCE&G filed a motion with the PSC to dismiss the ORS request, citing numerous legal deficiencies.","The PSC later chose to defer action on the ORS request in order to establish a briefing and hearing schedule. The PSC took this approach to allow for careful consideration of the arguments given, the potential impact of the proposed actions not just on the company but also to customers in the long run.","Additionally, the ORS filed a separate motion requesting that the PSC consider the most prudent manner in which SCE&G should pass the value of the Toshiba guarantee payments to customers. We have consistently stated that we intend to use the value of these payments to mitigate cost to our customers. Our goal is to establish this through a comprehensive settlement with the interested parties, which can be presented to the PSC for consideration and approval.","The bottom of the slide lists the corresponding briefing and hearing schedule associated with the September 26 ORS petition.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jimmy to discuss our financial results.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Kevin. Before I discuss earnings, I wanted to go over 2 significant financial events that occurred this quarter: the receipt of proceeds from the Toshiba guarantee and the impairment charge associated with the nuclear project.","Slide 4 presents a breakdown of the cash received both through the monetization on September 27 and the receipt of the initial payment from Toshiba on October 2. The total amount realized is approximately 92% of the Toshiba guarantee, and as previously stated, the value of these payments will be used to mitigate cost to our customers.","Slide 5 depicts the impairment loss recorded for the quarter as it relates to the new nuclear project. While we believe that the issues regarding recovery of these costs and the rates being collected under the BLRA for financing costs should be resolved in future proceedings before the South Carolina Public Service Commission, the public, political and regulatory response to the abandonment decision has been extremely contentious.","In light of this and under applicable accounting guidance, SCE&G took a $210 million pre-tax impairment charge or $132 million, net of taxes. The estimate was determined by taking the total cost expended on the new nuclear project that have not been included in revised rates and offsetting those with the approximate net value of the Toshiba settlement proceeds.","As you are aware, there remains great uncertainty as to the eventual regulatory outcome regarding the abandonment of the project, but it's our current estimate of an impairment charge that is both probable and reasonably estimable under applicable accounting principles.","The recording of this impairment loss under the accounting rules does not mean that we will not seek full recovery of our prudently incurred costs as there are many possible outcomes to the upcoming regulatory process, and this estimate is subject to change as that process unfolds.","I'll now begin our earnings discussion on Slide 6. Earnings in the third quarter of 2017 were $0.24 per share compared to a $1.32 per share in the same quarter of 2016. This decrease is primarily related to the impairment loss. As explained in the footnote, abnormal weather increased earnings by $0.08 per share in the third quarter of 2017 compared to abnormal weather contributing $0.27 per share in the third quarter of 2016, resulting in a negative $0.19 per share impact to earnings quarter-over-quarter. Gas revenues, offset by higher gas costs, contributed to the earnings for the quarter. Lower O&M expenses and higher other income offset increases in depreciation, property taxes and interest expense.","Please turn to Slide 7. Earnings per share for the 9 months ended September 30, 2017, were $2.28 per share versus $3.29 per share for the same period in 2016. Again, this decrease is primarily related to the previously mentioned impairment loss associated with the new nuclear project. Higher electric revenues were more than offset by expenses related to fuel for generation, purchased power costs and the impact of abnormal weather compared to the prior year.","As noted at the bottom of the slide, abnormal weather decreased earnings by $0.12 per share for the first 9 months of 2017, while weather increased earnings by $0.27 per share for the comparable period of 2016 for a year-over-year decrease of $0.39. Additionally, increases in gas revenues, partially offset by gas costs as well as lower O&M expenses and higher other income, boosted earnings for the year. Interest expense, depreciation and property taxes all increased compared to the prior period.","Now on Slide 8, I'd like to briefly review the earnings results for our principal lines of business. SCE&G's third quarter 2017 earnings decreased versus the same quarter of 2016 due primarily to the impairment loss and the quarter-over-quarter impact of abnormal weather and lower O&M. PSNC's earnings were up $0.04 per share for the third quarter of 2017 over the comparable period in 2016 due to higher gas revenues as a result of a rate increase and customer growth as well as lower O&M. SCANA Energy's earnings for the quarter increased due to lower bad debt expense and lower O&M.","I would now like to touch on economic trends in our service territory on Slide 9. Through the third quarter of 2017, company's announced plans to invest approximately $1 billion, with the expectation of creating over 10,000 jobs in our North and South Carolina territories.","At the bottom of the slide, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of September 2017 and '16. South Carolina's unemployment rate is 3.9%, the lowest the state has seen since November of 2000 and a full percentage point below a year ago. South Carolina continues to see a decrease in unemployment despite continued growth in the labour force. The other states in which we have service territories, North Carolina and Georgia, also continue to see declining unemployment rates of 4.1% and 4.5%, respectively.","These positive business developments continue to play a significant role in strong customer growth presented on Slide 10. The top half of the slide shows the customer growth rate for each of our regulated businesses. SCE&G's electric business added customers at a year-over-year rate of 1.3%. Our regulated gas businesses in South and North Carolina added customers at a rate of 2.9% and 2.6%, respectively.","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather-normalized kilowatt-hour sales to retail customers for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017. On a 12-month ended basis, weather-normalized sales are 0.8% higher versus the prior period.","Now please look at Slide 11, which recaps our regulatory returns. SCE&G's base electric business, in which we are allowed a 10.25% return on equity, earned a return for the 12 months ended September 30, 2017, of 8.93%, down 95 basis points due to the negative impact of weather. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.25% in our gas LDC in South Carolina. These rates are set according to the Rate Stabilization Act. If the earned ROE of the gas business for the 12 months ending March 31 falls outside of the range of 50 basis points above or below the allowed ROE, we file to adjust rates.","As of March 31, 2017, the 12-month earned return for SCE&G gas was below the band, and we filed for an annual increase. The PSC approved the request for an $8.6 million revenue increase, and the new rates will become effective beginning with the first billing cycle in November.","As of September 30, 2017, the 12-month earned return for PSNC Energy was 11.61%. This situation is a result of a timing difference on a large capital project scheduled for completion in December of 2017. PSNC does not include [quip in its rate base. However, once this project is completed, it will be added to rate base and the earned ROE should more closely approximate the allowable ROE.","Slide 12 presents our estimated CapEx forecast. We have removed the base electric business in South Carolina from this forecast as that plan is highly contingent on the outcome and treatment of the new nuclear abandonment decision. However, this forecast highlights our renewed focus on the regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina. As you can see, the total investment in these gas businesses will exceed $1 billion over the next 3 years. Customer growth is the most significant driver for these investments, and continued pipeline integrity investment is also an ongoing focus. Once the NND abandonment process is resolved, we will update the full CapEx and financing plans accordingly.","I would now like to discuss our 2017 earnings guidance on Slide 13. We are reiterating our 2017 GAAP-adjusted weather-normalized earnings guidance range of $4.15 to $4.35 per share and our internal target of $4.25 per share. This measure excludes the impact of abnormal weather and the impairment loss.","At this time, we are unable to provide long-term earnings guidance. While there are fundamental positive factors such as our strong customer growth and the continued expansion of our regulated gas businesses, the key consideration will obviously be the treatment of the abandoned new nuclear project. Once the nuclear abandonment recovery has been addressed, we will provide updated long-term guidance.","Before I conclude our prepared remarks, I wanted to set the tone for our Q&A session. As we have said in various legislative hearings, we believe our actions related to the nuclear project have been prudent and were in the best interest of our customers. While it is always our intention to be as transparent as possible, please understand we are not in a position to discuss the possible time lines and outcomes of any pending litigation or investigation surrounding the new nuclear project.","We'll now be glad to respond to your questions on other matters.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So perhaps just -- I know it's a little bit tricky for you guys to talk, but perhaps, could you elaborate a little bit on thinking of recovery of sort of related capital expenditures, for instance, the $300 million to $400 million on the associated transmission and how you think about that in the context of your lag as -- into '18 as well as potential replacement capacity today and what the time line, at least to address that conversation, might be despite everything else going on?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Julien, it's Jimmy. I'll start on that. So, the transmission is, roughly, 75% of it is in service today, completed construction, and the other is progressing. So, it's already strengthened the system and is used and useful today. So, we don't really see a concern in that. And it's -- really, what our proposal was in our original petition, and we'll take this back up at some point, is for that to be considered down the road as part of the base electric business. So, we'll -- we would propose to incorporate that into the kind of the returns of the base business and that be considered in a base rate case down the road. As far as current capacity, et cetera, we're buying on the open market today. It's fairly available out there. We're buying 300 megawatts today. So, we'll re-evaluate that once we get this situation cleared up with the new nuclear here.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Got it. And so basically, there could be a potential replacement, all that gas capacity or extensions just in terms of open market purchase -- continuing the open market purchases for the time being?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, no commitment either way at this point. The current purchase runs through the end of '19, so we've got some room to evaluate that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And then turning to the gas utilities side of the business. Obviously, with a reduced CapEx budget today, how are you thinking about a potential to accelerate spend on the PSNC at the South Carolina gas utility piece today? And when would you expect to update or discuss your capital budgets on that side? Again, trying to be respectful of ignoring the other questions at large here.","Jimmy Addison","Yes. So, on the 2 gas LDCs, we'll update that CapEx quarterly as we have project changes, et cetera. And I would say I wouldn't characterize it as accelerating spend necessarily as it is responding to the customers' needs and demands. So as the lower natural gas price is projected for quite a period of time, there's been a lot of demand for it from industrial customers for electric generation and from other IOUs, et cetera. So, it's really responding to that [indiscernible] CapEx every quarter as we re-evaluate the projects over the next kind of 36-month view. That's typically what we disclose.","Operator","And our next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Kevin, can I just ask, too? I don't know if you can respond to that. Has the board responded to the letter that was sent by the governor or not?","Kevin Marsh","Yes, we had a board meeting this week, and certainly, the board is aware of the letter that came out from the governor. Those are issues that had previously been raised by the Office of Regulatory Staff and their filings or other filings before the commission, so it was not really a new issue. So, it didn't surprise me that the governor sent the letter. Those are topics that have gotten a lot of attention from a variety of parties. It certainly doesn't have any weight in terms of authority from a law perspective, but we don't want to ignore his opinion. Those are facts. It will be evaluated in the hearings as we address the issues that have already been filed at the commission by the Office of Regulatory Staff.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then I know -- just trying to get a little bit because we are in kind of a no man's land. Kevin, from your perspective, when is -- do you think, knowing what you know now, is that we get some kind of settlement or resolve of this case one way or the other as we look into the future? Could you kind of walk us through what this petition, the timing? And when does it get addressed in terms of some kind of a clarity to your shareholders? Could you just walk us through some time lines or something?","Kevin Marsh","Sure, and that's a fair question. There are a couple of things, I believe, could have an impact on that. Back up just a little bit and remind you, when we filed our petition with the commission in early August for our abandonment decision or the treatment under the abandonment clause under the Base Load Review Act, that would have triggered a 6-month period based on a normal hearing schedule at the commission. ","When we were asked by the leaders of the House and the Senate to withdraw that to give them a chance to go to their review process, we did that, which I still believe it was a good idea to give everybody a chance to understand all the facts and circumstances around the decision that we made. That kind of put that process on hold, so once we refile with the commission, that would again start the 6-month process. And we have told the House and the Senate and other leaders around the state that at some point, we will need to go back and file with the commission because that is the avenue for a file decision. ","When we were in front of both of the House and the Senate committees, giving explanations and details behind the decision to make -- to do the abandonment, we talked about our goal and desire to find the right parties to bring together that would include both of their representatives, trying to find a comprehensive settlement. It would be in everybody's best interest and mitigate cost to customers going forward. And we envision that, that would be done through a settlement process that typically took place as part of the regulatory process. This is a very different situation, given the attention that's been given to it. ","So, I believe at this point is we will find a settlement process outside of the commission filing probably before we actually make the filing with the commission. We have had some preliminary conceptual discussions with some of the parties. Out of respect for the process or the parties, I don't want to get into the details at this point because we don't have anything definitive, but we will certainly make a disclosure when there's something substantive to discuss. All that being said, the House and the Senate, I believe, are close to concluding their review process. ","Their goal is to, as they've indicated to us, is determine what changes, if any, they want to make to the regulatory structure or the Base Load Review Act on a go-forward basis. Their desire to have that prepared to go when the session comes back in, in early [indiscernible]. So, it would be my hope we've got a settlement position in place that hopefully we've all agreed to that we can file with the commission prior to the session coming back into play in early January or shortly thereafter. But that's dependent, I think, upon the duration of the settlement discussions and different opportunities might have as part of that process. ","We would like to do that before the end of the year, but we want to be respectful of the process and give this settlement option an opportunity to work itself through, which I think will be helpful to the overall regulatory process when we do file. So, I know that's not a definitive answer, but we're not talking a year. I think we're talking within the next 6 months that we would file and hopefully get a decision from the commission within that 6-month time frame.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Frank with Corso Capital Management.","David Frank","A question. Just assuming that you fail to reach a settlement hypothetically here. If the legislature took action against South Carolina Gas and Electric to disallow recovery of some or all of its investment in VC Summer, would that same law also apply to the recovery for Santee Cooper? And if not, why?","Kevin Marsh","Now let me see if I can sort through the couple of questions you've got there. The work that's being done by the legislature is not part of the official regulatory process. Certainly, their opinions would carry a lot of weight, but my understanding is they cannot reach a decision on their own as to make something happen. It would ultimately have to go back through the commission. So, they may have recommendations for the commission, they may have recommendations relative to the Base Load Review Act itself. But they would not be the ones that would make the decision as part of the regulatory filing we would make at the commission for the abandonment treatment. If there were a settlement, I think that settlement would go to the commission. ","If there were not a settlement and for some unfortunate reason, we were not able to reach a settlement, then the company would have the ability to file, as it did back in August, and go through the traditional regulatory process, of which I'm sure the legislative bodies would likely intervene and give their opinions as part of that process. But they can't make the decision on their own from a regulatory perspective without going through the commission under the current law. Santee Cooper is not -- Santee Cooper is not subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission. So, their board is the authority now that makes decisions relative to their rates and what rates they would charge their customers to recover their bond financing cost.","David Frank","Right. No, I understand that. But my point is that if the legislature tried to pass a new law, which somehow undid the BLRA or part of it, I think this is what every investor or one of the two main things investors are most afraid of, is that the legislature comes in and tries to rewrite a law. And I'm just wondering, would they shoot the state in the foot if they try to draft a law that targeted just South Carolina Gas and Electric? Would a law, in order to be fair, would it also have to apply to Santee Cooper's investments since they were a partner with you in the nuclear plant? From the perspective of they wouldn't want to cost themselves, the state billions of dollars if they tried to somehow undermine your recovery, there would have to be a level playing field that a law would also have to apply to your partner. I realize you're not regulated by the commission.","Kevin Marsh","Yes, well, Santee Cooper does not fall under the Base Load Review Act. So, if they took an effort to retroactively change the law or cancel a law altogether, that would not have a direct impact on Santee Cooper. I know that there's anything that precludes them from taking action directly against Santee Cooper since they do have -- since the governor does have control over the board and the members of the board and the decisions, I guess, they would ultimately make, that would-be part of that legal legislative process. But they don't fall -- Santee Cooper does not fall under the Base Load Review Act. I don't think they could reach out and try to apply that to them since it was designed to apply to the regulated utilities at the commission.","David Frank","Okay. And just on the $1.5 billion that you have yet to recover under the abandonment. If you don't reach a settlement, I assume you would look to file for recovery prior to the legislative session coming back in place. And my real question here is, by filing, does that somehow preserve any legal rights to recovery, give you a placeholder should there be some tampering or attempt to tamper with the law later rather than wait until after they try to change the law and then file?","Kevin Marsh","Well, we are certainly evaluating all of those options. And I'm comfortable saying that we're going to do everything we can to reach a settlement because I believe that's the best solution for all the parties involved. But absent a settlement, we do believe we would need to file to protect our customers and our investors. And we would do what we thought was in the best interest of those parties.","Operator","Our next question comes from Travis Miller with Morningstar.","Travis Miller","A bit of an accounting question here. On AFUDC, and I'm thinking about in terms of the guidance, what that AFUDC was projected back when you set that guidance, what it's developed into as you've added the $1-or-so billion of capital throughout the year, and then how that fits into the guidance range today, and then kind of what happens when you're not investing any capital in the third, fourth quarter on the nuclear project. Just wondering if you could walk me through kind of how that AFUDC built on the equity and the net interest would work.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Travis, this is Jimmy. So, the -- you're definitely right. We do expect it to be lower. I'm not going to get into individual projections on line items other than to say we get that all in the comprehensive evaluation of our guidance affirmation that we made earlier. But I will say that you're right, that, certainly, with lower spend, there's less AFUDC to be computed. And frankly, the rate has been lower this year as well because the way it works, we've had a lot of short-term debt outstanding during the first 9 months of the year. So that rate has been lower, too. So, it's been lower for both of those reasons. And then third, once we elect to abandon, we've really converted -- you no longer can really compute AFUDC kind of proper on it. We've computed a carrying cost, if you will, as a proxy that's based on the weighted average cost of our debt. So, we've made, really, those 3 factors that are impacting it, but we have considered all of that in our guidance update.","Travis Miller","Okay. Great. And then with the impairment, how does that then affect AFUDC? If I understand correctly, because you've been carrying some of that kind of $1-ish billion throughout the year, is AFUDC included in the impairment that you've recorded so far in the first and second quarter? Does that make sense?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, the impairment is the $210 million, Travis. If I understand your question, is there some AFUDC included in that $210 million? I believe so, but frankly, I'm not completely sure. But I believe there would be a proportional amount in there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza","I guess, you didn't want to talk about timing, and, I guess, you got pushed into talking about timing. I just need to just confirm just something. So, you're shooting for hopefully to file something within 6 months beginning of the year, and you're looking at a settlement with lawmakers by year-end. Is that about, right?","Kevin Marsh","Well, that would be certainly our goal, is to reach a settlement as soon as we could. I think a logical progression, assuming we make that settlement, would be we would file that along with the petition as soon after that as practical.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay. So -- okay. And then 2018 outlook likely will be pending until we get past those proceedings?","Kevin Marsh","Well, I think we need to understand what the settlement would be, and that will put us in a position with the data we need to do the longer-term projection based on that settlement.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, got it. And then just lastly, appreciate the sensitivity with the conversations with lawmakers. But is there any sort of any kind of visibility you can give us as far as what some of the pushes and takes are or at least how the conversations are going and how they're progressing at more of a top level?","Kevin Marsh","I really can't talk about the individual components of the conversation. There are a variety of issues on the table. Certainly, customers and legislators and our team have different views on many issues regarding recovery. We're looking for the solution that will try to balance those as best possible and maintain the financial health of our company so that we can continue to serve the customers that depend on us every day. We're at the very early stages. I just don't have anything definitive to report. I look at it as a positive that we're having discussions, and that process is hopefully going to continue to increase.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And it's fair to say that the settlement discussions pretty much relate to abandoning of the nuclear plant, right? There's no path to continue?","Kevin Marsh","Well, that -- we believe abandonment is the right decision in the best interest of our customers. We don't have any other potential partners that have stepped up and been willing to join the discussion. We did the comprehensive evaluation that shows, from a customer perspective, that while disappointing, abandonment is the best option. And once we chose that option, we look to figure to determine how we could lower the impact on customers. And that's why with the money coming in from Toshiba settlement, the benefit of the tax deduction, we believe abandonment is in their best interest. We don't know of any one that's expressed an interest to complete those plants anytime in the near future. I don't know what discussions the governor has had with the different people. But my understanding from my sources is that no one has expressed an interest in completing those plants today.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Ellinghaus with Williams Capital.","Christopher Ellinghaus","A couple of things about sort of the abandonment process itself. Have you made any sales or have any serious prospects for monetizing any equipment at this point?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Chris, we are looking at that, of course, in concert with our partner in that. But I don't believe that based upon what we know today, that any of that would-be material in relation to the cost incurred.","Christopher Ellinghaus","Okay. And has -- are you spending any money today to sort of button up the site? Or do you have any expectations that there'll be future expenditures required to sort of mothball the site, sort of akin to the way Santee Cooper has spoken about it in hearings?","Kevin Marsh","Yes, we're going through an evaluation now to determine what's necessary, and we have been taking steps to put the site in a safe condition, removing all of the cranes and the construction equipment that was on site to facilitate the work that was being done. We have materials and parts that are stored in warehouses. We're certainly doing inventories of those and sharing the listing of those with people that might have an interest in possibly purchasing those down the road. ","From a mothball perspective, under the abandonment provisions, under the Internal Revenue Code, if we intend to mothball the plant to potentially start it back up at a future date, that could put our decision to take the abandonment deduction in jeopardy. ","So, we're studying that very carefully now, knowing what you could preserve for potential future sale versus what you would truly abandon so you would qualify for the tax deduction. We don't have to make those decisions today, but we will need to make those by the end of the year. And we continue that evaluation with Santee Cooper to understand where that line would be drawn and what opportunities we would have. But our priority is to make sure we can preserve the ability to take the abandonment deduction because that's worth $2 billion to our customers, which is 3x the value of the Toshiba money that came in on an after-tax basis. So, it's a significant benefit for the customers, and we believe that's critical as part of our settlement discussions and trying to minimize the impact to our customers over the long term.","Christopher Ellinghaus","Okay, great. Can you talk about what you're spending today for legal and regulatory costs? Is it material?","Jimmy Addison","We've certainly ramped up compared to what we've normally incurred, that's for sure, Chris. But I would not say that it is material in relation to our financial statements in that context. It's a significant sum of money, that's for sure. But I [don't think it's material to our financials at this point.","Christopher Ellinghaus","Okay. And one last question. Kevin, you were sort of talking about you've had some modest talks with the legislature so far about settlement. Are they -- can you tell us, are they thinking similarly to you? Or is your thought process about trying to have a settlement by the end of the year sort of your hope? Or are they thinking along the same lines?","Kevin Marsh","Well, I believe what I said earlier is we were having some discussions with some of the parties that would be involved in the settlement. I don't believe I called out the legislature directly. There are people with different views on the timing and what their views would be on settlement. What I meant to indicate was based on what the House and the Senate committees have shared with us is they do plan to conclude their processes before the end of the year. And I'm hopeful that concluding their processes will give us an opportunity to conclude some successful settlement negotiations, at which we'll drive our filing with the commission. That's why I got to my year-end time frame.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Jenkins with The State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","So first, I had a couple of questions. The Toshiba guarantee, you've already recovered, it looks like, $1.1 billion. So, I assume that's already on your balance sheet. And is there a -- like how are you viewing that cash in terms of uses? Is that just going to sit their kind of as a rainy-day fund until you get more clarity? Or, I guess, how should we think about that cash that you currently have?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Dan, 2 different parts of that. So, the cash in the short term, we have used to pay down the commercial paper that was incurred to support the construction payments over this -- the last several months. So that's the cash side of it. So, we have essentially paid down most of that commercial paper that's matured over the last 30 days. And there will be some residual there that will be in cash, a minority of the amount. The separate tract to that is how is that ultimately used for the benefit of our customers, which we said from day 1 it would be. So that will be wrapped up, we hope, in this comprehensive settlement that Kevin's talked about earlier. That would be the regulatory treatment of it.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And similarly, you mentioned that the potential tax benefit from the abandonment is worth $2 billion. Is there anything additionally you need to do to kind of solidify that deduction for the current year tax return or whenever that would become eligible as a tax write-off?","Jimmy Addison","Yes. Our current intention is to take that deduction this year, which has some benefits and to reaching back a couple of years for taxes that were paid in earlier years. So, we think that to get that cash as soon as we can for the benefit of customers is the most advantageous route. So as Kevin elaborated earlier, we're doing everything we understand -- we can understand to make sure that we qualify for that this year because of the value of it. And so that's an ongoing process. Certainly, a lot of things had to be done with the stoppage of the construction to make the site safe, to stabilize different equipment -- let vendors remove equipment, et cetera, and secure the site. But we'll -- our intention is to wrap that up before year-end to solidify that deduction.","Dan Jenkins","So how should we think about just how that's going to flow through the cash flow statement in terms of -- how much would that $2 billion would be seen in this current year? And then how much would be left over for future tax credits and so forth? How long would that probably extend? Do you have a feeling for that?","Jimmy Addison","Yes. So, some of the $2 billion, as you'll remember from -- maybe from our application filing, about 25% of it, we had already claimed through the various R&E tax credits. The other 75% or $1.5 billion is what we're talking about here. And there might be a couple hundred million dollars that we can -- $200 million to $250 million that we can reach back into an earlier year if we claim the deduction this year. And then the balance of, let's say, $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, we would have to use prospectively over -- we project it would take us probably 4 to 5 years to use that through NOL.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then I just want to make sure I'm understanding kind of the legal arguments being made. I'm not an attorney. I recognize you guys are neither, but I imagine you've had quite a few meetings and conversations with attorneys. So, I just want to verify my understanding's correct. So, the ORS, when they filed a petition to suspend the rate collections, that was primarily based on the AG opinion, right, that the Base Load Review Act law was potentially unconstitutional? Is that -- am I reading that correctly?","Kevin Marsh","Part of the filing, but the ORS did refer to the opinion that came from the Attorney General where he said that portions of the Base Load Review Act may be suspect as to their constitutionality, but that really doesn't have any weight in the law because it's never gotten -- never going through or contested by a court of the state. The opinion, while it is an opinion, has no weight at this point, in our opinion, which is why we challenge the filing with the Office of Regulatory Staff at the commission.","Dan Jenkins","Right. And that opinion, at least I looked at it over somewhat, it sounds like the basis of that opinion primarily rests on kind of the concept of the plants not used and useful. Was that your reading of that or what you've heard from your attorneys? Was that...","Kevin Marsh","Yes, I can't -- Dan, I can't make a legal judgment on the basis they determine their opinion. I just know we believe that the law that's on the books today is constitutional. We believe it's been in place for 9, 10 years. It's been at the commission, have been followed by the commission. It's been in the Supreme Court a couple of times, and nobody has challenged the constitutionality of the law to this point. And there's just a strong presumption that a law is constitutional when it's passed by the General Assembly. That's generally the case, and we would stand by that and intend to defend that if necessary.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And beyond just -- like there's been -- there's quite a bit of case law that has allowed recovery for like cost, the plants that were abandoned because they became uneconomic and so forth, that would kind of go against the argument being made on the Houston usefulness. Is that your understanding as well?","Kevin Marsh","Again, I just can't get into the legal opinions. We believe what we have done and invested under law was appropriate and under the law to the extent we reach a settlement or otherwise would be recoverable under the terms and conditions of the law.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then speaking of the settlement that you're hopeful to reach, there's still probably a number of parties though that probably -- it sounds like at least their current positions are something you wouldn't be able to agree to, particularly thinking of some of the environmental groups and so forth. So, unless everybody agreed to the settlement, it's still likely to be -- or it's still potentially to be litigated through the courts. Is that your -- what we should expect? Or how should we think about that?","Kevin Marsh","Well, I can't speak for them, but I know we have had numerous settlements that have gone before the commission. To my knowledge, the environmental groups have not signed on to any of those. And I'm drawing on my memory so I could be incorrect here, but some of those, they have appealed, and some of those, they have not appealed when they've been approved by the commission. I don't believe it's gone all one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Simple question. How do reserve margins now look in South Carolina state as a whole and then your service territory over the next 3 to 5 years?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Michael, I don't have anything on reserve margins at my fingertips now, but I'd go back to my comments earlier about capacity. We found a market where we could buy capacity when the plants were delayed. And we're in that cycle now where we purchase that capacity through the end of '19. So generally, there's energy to be had in the southeast. So, I just can't comment any more specifically about it right now in the near term.","Kevin Marsh","Yes, I can add a little bit to that, Michael. With the purchase we've got, we're within the guidelines that have been established by the commissioner. We typically follow with the commission for an adequate reserve margin. We've heard Lonnie Carter from Santee Cooper, their former CEO, indicate that they didn't need any generation for quite a few years. So, I know they've got plenty of capacity. So, our belief is there is available capacity in the marketplace for us to access should the need be there for us to maintain our reserve margins.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And where are you in terms of thinking about incremental renewable developments in South Carolina?","Kevin Marsh","Yes, we have been doing renewable development for a number of years under Act 236. It was passed by the commission 3, 4 years ago. We had guidelines set forth in that. We're well on our way to meeting those guidelines. There are certainly a lot of companies or investors that have looked to bring solar onto the system, under the [purple requirements. We have quite a few megawatts in the queue that we will continue to evaluate. We've got about 50 megawatts on the system now. That could easily double here in the near future based on the interest we've seen. And again, I'd remind everyone, we are not opposed to renewables. We think they have a good solid place on the system. We just got to make sure we do it in a way that we can meet our peak needs when that energy is available, we're a winter peaking company, and that typically happens in the early morning hours before the sun has risen to the point that all of those solar farms would generate what we need. So, we got to be cautious on how we do that. But certainly, we're ramping up our efforts to bring solar onto the system. We just finished a solar farm close to 2 megawatts right outside of our campus here in the last 30 days, and it will be online soon.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman","Maybe if you read the papers and listen to the hearings, it doesn't sound like you have a lot of friends down there right now. So, I'm just curious in terms of any settlement talks you've had so far. Is the tone of those different than what we hear in the papers and listen to in the hearings [indiscernible] so far?","Kevin Marsh","Yes, we have had very preliminary discussions. The tone has been open, looking for ideas. We're talking about conceptual ways we might be able to find a solution, but we don't have anything definitive yet. But I'm optimistic the fact that people are talking to us, that we'll have some legitimate effort to find a solution.","Jimmy Addison","Steve, this is Jimmy. I'd just offer one word. I would just say that the characterization would be professional, very, very professional discussions.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And is there a breadth of parties involved here in terms of just the people that you would normally have to have an agreement with?","Kevin Marsh","I don't want to get into the particular parties at this point, but I would also tell you though, we typically have a wide variety to include the Office of Regulatory Staff. I think in this case, for us to be successful, we're going to have to have input from the legislature. And we also typically have input from our large industrial customers, small business, Chamber of Commerce, other large customers that may have an interest in the settlement. I don't see that any different. But the real difference I see at this point would be having a legislature involved. The Electric Cooperatives of South Carolina certainly, I think, have a vested interest over the long term, and I think we're likely to see them at the table as we go through these discussions. So, it'd be a little broader group than we typically have, but most of the players, we know well and we have good relationships with them. And as Jimmy said, we'll have a professional discussion.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then just one numbers question. What is your total collection so far under the BLRA? Do you have like a cumulative number?","Jimmy Addison","It's about $1.7 billion.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. And then one other -- just a quick one. Just -- is your 10 -- when's your 10-Q going to be filed?","Jimmy Addison","It's got to be filed by, I believe, the deadline is like November 9, and we'll file it inside of that deadline.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Fremont with Mizuho.","Paul Fremont","I guess, Southern Company basically has indicated that they're going to recommend using the Toshiba proceeds to reduce the regulatory asset. And, I guess, their claim is that in the long run, ratepayers are going to be better off because, ultimately, if you just used the money that -- to pay out the refunds on a near-term basis, customers are going to end up spending a lot more sort of over the duration. Any thoughts on that? And also from a shareholder perspective, would not using the Toshiba proceeds reduce the regulatory asset? Wouldn't that essentially de-risk some of the investments that you've made in the plant?","Jimmy Addison","Paul, this is Jimmy. I would just say that, certainly, the settlement funds there are central to these discussions that we're having. I'm not going to get into characterizing individual parts and kind of the process and all that Kevin said initially. But it's an important part. But I would reemphasize something else, which is this tax deduction is 3x the amount of this Toshiba settlement. So -- and it's cash, just from a different source. And so, both of those are on the table and key to these discussions.","Paul Fremont","Okay. And then if I look at the -- at your Slide 3, the -- and the schedule, if oral arguments are scheduled right now on December 12, would it be fair to say that within 2 to 3 months after that would be sort of the expected time line for a final order in that proceeding?","Jimmy Addison","No. So, Paul, this is just the schedule around ORS's motions and our motions around their filing to stop collecting the rates, et cetera. What Kevin described earlier is if we get a settlement process working, we'll need to, in accordance with the statute here in South Carolina, we'll need to file the abandonment proceeding again that we withdrew mid-August. And that was...","Paul Fremont","Right. No, I'm just saying, on this motion, when would sort of the expected time frame be for a final order on their motion?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I don't know that, that's specifically outlined. So, I think that's probably up to the commission's discretion, but I don't know the specific answer to that.","Paul Fremont","Okay. And then -- and you were talking just now about sort of a separate abandonment filing. So, assuming -- I would assume that if you were to reach a settlement, it would be in the context of that filing that hasn't even yet occurred, right? But that would be the proceeding in which it would most likely be applicable?","Jimmy Addison","That would be correct. And we would file that settlement and the support of it in that proceeding.","Paul Fremont","And then if you're unable to reach a settlement, is there sort of an expected time frame by which you would likely file the abandonment case?","Kevin Marsh","We haven't given -- this is Kevin. We haven't given a particular time frame. We want to make sure we've exhausted all opportunities for a settlement before we consider that track.","Paul Fremont","Okay. And then my last question is, I think the legislature or members, certain individuals in the legislature have asked to become intervenors in some of the cases, I guess, the -- maybe the ORS motion to dismiss as well as your original abandonment case. Is there a potential conflict in them acting as an intervenor in the case, given the fact that they select the commissioners?","Kevin Marsh","I don't know the answer to that question, but I can confirm they have intervened. I don't know that, that's a negative at this point because that gives us an opportunity to negotiate with them as intervenors in any potential hearing, which is, to me, a plus for the opportunity for a settlement process to occur.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson","Well, you'll be happy to know that most of my questions have been answered, but just sort of to follow up on the legislature and sort of the settlement process. It appears that the central issue sort of abandonment and sort of the tax benefit, which is clearly a big mitigation element, is not fully understood by the commissioner, perhaps other party -- excuse me, so the legislatures and perhaps some of the other parties. Insofar from what I've heard, insofar as if they don't want you to build it, they want you to mothball it. A number of them do, and even the ORS seems to be suggesting that, that seems to be part of it. I'm just wondering, I mean, in terms of your discussions with these guys, and I know -- I don't want you to get too far ahead of yourselves on it, but just in general, how should we think about this? Because it seems that there is a big disparity when we think in terms of how people are thinking about sort of these fundamental issues in terms of resolving and mitigating the issue for ratepayers. Do you follow me?","Jimmy Addison","I do, Paul, and I understand where you're coming from that, especially if you're kind of watching from afar and seeing some of this. I will say that some of the legislative committee members have understood this from day 1, and I think it's becoming clear to most. And I think the local press here has even picked up on this issue today and have publicized it some more. So, I think folks are starting to understand. And the choice is really pretty simple. It's $4.2 billion that we have to recover or take -- get the tax deduction solidified, and it's $2 billion ultimately. So, it's a huge difference. Obviously, almost 50%, and both of those are after the net of tax impact of the Toshiba settlement. So, it is a huge issue. It's almost half of the difference. So, I think everyone is catching on to this.","Paul Patterson","Okay. And then I can -- I have to think that this is somewhat of an expensive process, given all the sort of investigations and litigation and everything else. How should we think about -- I mean, how material, if you can give us sort of a sense, just the cost of all this is and how that might, in fact, impact EPS and how we should think about that going forward.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, all I'll say about earnings is we have contemplated that in our updated guidance that we gave earlier this afternoon. So, it's in that commitment to the $4.15 to the $4.35 based upon what we know today, we've made an estimate of and have it contemplated. But it is expensive. But it's not, I would say, material to the financial statement. It's very expensive in time, too. And it is absorbing a lot of time of a lot of us. That's why it's important that we get to some conclusions on these settlements as well.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kamal Patel with Wells Fargo.","Kamal Patel","I have 2 questions, one regarding the impairment charge. So, the $1.22 billion is what was basically subject to review. Are you just making the assumption that, that is no longer recoverable? And if so, given the past state court proceedings in support of the BLRA, why would you be inclined to make that decision?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, Kamal, it's Jimmy. So, what we're doing there is, under the accounting principles, we've got to mix our best estimate of what's probable and reasonably estimable. And that's what we've done under these accounting principles. And recording of the loss under the rules doesn't mean that we'll not seek full recovery of our prudently incurred costs. That's not what we're suggesting here at all. There's many possible outcomes to the proceeding and to our -- even to our settlement discussions to this point. We're just trying to, as best we can, apply these accounting rules to the situation at this point. So, we're not giving up on asking for those costs at all.","Kamal Patel","So, this isn't -- this in no way is a -- I guess, viewed being taken on past legal decisions?","Jimmy Addison","No, it is not. It is simply an application of the -- of our application and a highly judgmental situation of the accounting rules. It's not a legal position at all.","Kamal Patel","Okay. And then just looking at capital structure. Would this revision slow down and, I guess, your dividend growth on one topic? And then would there be explicit support given to ratings through equity infusion at the utility level or something like that, if needed?","Jimmy Addison","Let me make sure I understand your first question. Was it -- first part of this question. Was it tied back to this impairment?","Kamal Patel","Generally speaking, the slower earnings growth trajectory that you could realize from the project not being in -- proceed any longer.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, well, as we said earlier, I'm really not going to be able to answer that because we're not commenting on long-term guidance at this point. But we have -- we've not commented on anything on guidance. We've not said it will be slower. We've not said it will be the same. We've not said it will be faster. So, we've got to get through this process, get a new base, if you will, for what we're going to base our earnings growth off of. And then we'll comment on guidance long term.","Kamal Patel","Okay. And then from a ratings perspective?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, repeat your question there for me? I'm sorry.","Kamal Patel","From a ratings perspective, will there -- would -- if there was additional equity needed by the utility, will there be an infusion of equity or would you let the ratings weaken?","Jimmy Addison","Well, I think the ratings today don't necessarily reflect the metrics because of all the uncertainty around the whole resolution to this matter. So, I think we've got to get through the -- I know we have to get through the resolution of this matter so that the agencies can better project what the future's going to look like with some certainty. Because the metrics we have today are different than the ratings most of them have been adjusted here in the short term. So, I don't really want to get into the speculation of what we might do with different outcomes. But I think we just -- it's kind of the same answer as the other one. We've got to get to the resolution of this uncertainty, understand where we are, then we can update long-term guidance and look at the whole cap structure and see where we need to go. Our desire would be if we're in a fiscal position to do it after this legislative regulatory outcome to have an investment-grade-rated opco and holdco, assuming we've got the financial wherewithal to do that.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Kevin Marsh for any closing remarks.","Kevin Marsh","Thanks for taking time to join us today and certainly for asking your questions. I want to say our top priority remains finding this comprehensive settlement that will lead to a fair regulatory decision on the abandonment of the new nuclear project. However, as we work through that process, we will continue to focus on operating our businesses in a safe and reliable manner. And again, I thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in SCANA. Have a good evening.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

Thank you for standing by. I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SCANA Corporation Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded on Thursday, February 19, 2015. Anyone who does not consent to the taping may drop off the line.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Susan Wright, Director of Financial Planning and Investor Relations.","Susan Wright","Thank you, and welcome to our Analyst Call. As you know, earlier today we announced financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. Joining us on the call today are Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer; and Steve Byrne, Chief Operating Officer of SCE&G.","During the call, Jimmy will provide an overview of our financial results and related matters, and Steve will provide an update on our new nuclear project. After our comments, we will respond to your questions. Slides and the earnings release referenced to in this call are available at scana.com.","Additionally, we post information related to our new nuclear project and other Investor Relations information directly to our Web site at scana.com. On SCANA's home page, there is a yellow box containing links to the new nuclear development and other Investor Relations information section of the Web site.

The Company does not recognize an obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Additionally, we may disclose certain non-GAAP measures during this presentation, and the required Reg G information can be found on the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","I will now turn the call over to Jimmy.","Jimmy Addison","Thanks, Susan, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll begin our earnings discussion on Slide 3. Basic earnings in the fourth quarter of 2014 were $0.73 per share consistent with the same period of the prior year. Overall, electric margins increased during the fourth quarter of 2014 versus the same quarter of the prior year due primarily to continued recovery of financing cost through the Base Load Review Act or BLRA and customer growth.","As a reminder, the electric weather normalization pallet ended in December 2013 and the Company\u2019s financial results for 2014 and going forward are now impacted by abnormal weather in our electric business. Accordingly, during the fourth quarter of 2014, we estimate that weather had a negative impact of $0.02 on electric margins versus the fourth quarter of the prior year. Additionally, high gas margins and a slight decrease in the Company\u2019s effective tax rate also contributed to the quarter. These increases were offset by expected increases in operations and maintenance expenses and CapEx related items including depreciation, interest expense as well as share dilution.","Please turn to Slide 4. Basic earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $3.79 per share versus $3.40 per share in 2013. Increases in electric and gas margins as well as the decreases in the effective tax rate were partially offset by operations and maintenance expenses and higher expenses in dilution related to our capital program. For the full year of 2014, we estimate weather added $0.21 per share to electric margins versus the prior year.","Now on Slide 5, I\u2019d like to briefly review results for our principle lines of business. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company's full year earnings denoted in blue were up $0.41 per share for 2014 compared to the prior year. This was driven largely by increases in electric margin which were due primarily to abnormal weather plus the continued recovery of financing cost through the BLRA and customer growth. Higher gas margins also contributed to the earnings improvement. These increases were partially offset by increases in O&M expenses, expenses related to our capital program including property taxes, interest expense and depreciation as well as share dilution. For the fourth quarter, basic earnings per share were $0.02 higher than the same period last year. PSNC Energy\u2019s earnings shown in red were $0.39 per share for the full year of 2014 compared to $0.37 per share in the prior year. This increase is mainly attributable to customer growth. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings were $0.16 per share consistent with 2013.","SCANA Energy our retail and natural gas marketing business in Georgia in green showed an increase in earnings per share of $0.01 over last year. This was mainly due to increased margins from higher throughput during the first and fourth quarters of 2014. As a reminder, the increased margins in the first quarter were partially offset by higher commodity prices experienced concerning the incremental volumes and price competition. For the fourth quarter of 2014, basic earnings per share were also up $0.01 over the same period of 2013.","SCANA\u2019s corporate and other businesses reported a loss of $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to near breakeven results in the fourth quarter of the prior year. For the 12 month period these businesses reported a loss of $0.01 per share in 2014 compared to earnings of $0.04 per share in 2013. This change is primarily the result of higher interest expense at the holding company due to the accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost associated with hybrid securities that were called at par in early 2015 prior to their maturity.","On Slide 6 we have provided two years of historical financial data on the two subsidiary sales we recently announced to assist in updating your models. The CGT transaction closed on January 31st and the SCI transaction is scheduled to close shortly. To recap, these transactions will generate approximately $650 million of gross proceeds. Our updated estimate of the net cash available to fund our expansion will exceed $425 million after taxes. I will discuss the planned changes to our financing plan shortly.","I\u2019ll now like to touch on the economic trends in our service territory. As you can see on Slide 7, during 2014 company\u2019s announced plans to invest over $1 billion with the expectation of creating over 7,500 jobs in our Carolina\u2019s territories. At the bottom of the slide, you can see the national unemployment rate along with the rates for the three states where SCANA has a presence and the SCE&G electric territory. South Carolina\u2019s unemployment rate is now at 6.5% and the rate in SCE&G's electric territory is estimated at 5.6%.","At top of Slide 8, you can see the South Carolina unemployment statistics as of December 2014 and 2013. Although the South Carolina unemployment rate only dropped at 10th of a percentage point from the end of 2013, December 2014 marked all-time highs for the number of South Carolinians employed and in the labor force. The nearly 50,000 additions to the work force represented 2.4% increase over December 2013 levels. So in short the expansion of the economy has clearly motivated many that have removed themselves from actively seeking work back into the work force.","The December market numbers from the South Carolina Association of Realtors showed increases in new listings, pending sales and medium sales prices while available housing inventory shrank. I also wanted to mention as depicted at the bottom of the slide that United Van Lines recently released its annual mover study for 2014 which tracks migration patterns state to state, once again South Carolina and North Carolina ranked second and third respectively in terms of domestic migration destinations collaborating our realized customer growth statistics. These are all very positive signs for our territories.","Slide 9 presents customer growth and electric sales statistics. On the top of the slide are the customer growth rates for each of our regulated businesses. We continue to see strong customer growth in our businesses and in the region. SCE&G electric business added customers at an annual rate of 1.4%. Our regulated gas businesses in North and South Carolina added customers at 2.5% and 2.8% respectively. A particular note is the fact that all of these rates accelerated during the year. ","The bottom table outlines our actual and weather normalized kilowatt hour sales for the 12 months ended December 31, 2014. Overall, weather normalized total retail sales were up 0.6% on a 12 month ended basis, driven mainly by strong industrial demand. We continue to see slightly lower weather normalized consumption at the residential level reflecting anticipated energy efficiencies.","Now please turn to Slide 10 which recaps our regulatory rate base and returns. The pie chart on the left presents the components of our regulative rate base of approximately $8.9 billion. As denoted in the two shades of blue, approximately 85% of this rate base is related to the electric business. In the block on the right, you will see SCE&G's base electric businesses, in which we were allowed a 10.25% return on equity. The earned return for the 12 months ended December 31st in the base electric business is approximately 10%, meeting our stated goal of earning a return of 9% or higher to prevent the need for non-BLRA-related base rate increases during the peak nuclear construction years. We're very pleased with the execution of our strategy.","Continuing down the page, on our new nuclear business, we're allowed an 11% return on equity. As you may recall, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina approved our 2014 request for revised rates under the BLRA, which added incremental CWIP of approximately $561 million to our rate base and increased rates by approximately 2.8% in November.","Our regulated gas businesses in the Carolinas continue to perform well. We're allowed a return on equity of 10.6% and 10.25% in North Carolina and South Carolina respectively and we continue to operate these businesses within a reasonable range of those returns. As a reminder, in November SCE&G's gas business implemented a $2.6 million revenue reduction as a result of the Rate Stabilization Act.","Slide 11 presents our CapEx forecast. This forecast has been updated to reflect our most current CapEx projections for 2015 and '16 and is now inclusive of our 2017 estimates. Note that this forecast excludes CGT and SCI as the sale of CGT has been completed and the transaction for SCI is expected to close by the end of this quarter. Also this forecast reflects the company's current estimate of new nuclear spending through 2017, which is updated from what was filed in our quarterly BLRA report. The data in the BLRA reports are limited to the last approved order by this Public Service Commission in South Carolina and are not always consistent with our new nuclear CapEx expectations. This forecast more accurately aligns itself with our anticipated project spending over the next three years as it relates to the schedule delay. At the bottom of the Slide, we recapped the new nuclear CWIP from July 1 through June 30 to correspond to the periods on which the BLRA rate increases are calculated.","Now please turn to Slide 12. To summarize our financings for 2014, on May 27th SCE&G issued $300 million of 50 year bonds at 4.5%. On the equity side, we issued approximately $100 million from 401(NYSE:K) matching and DRIP plans. Looking forward, we have revised our estimated financing plan through 2019. While these are our best estimates of incremental debt and equity issuances, it's unlikely that these issuances will occur exactly as presented as they're subject to changing in our funding needs for planned project expenses. This plan contemplates both the estimated delays in the timing of the disbursements related to the new nuclear project as well as deployment of the proceeds from the sale of the subsidiaries. As mentioned in our press release, the plan to use the cash precedes net of taxes from the sales of subs to displace equity issuances. However, until we can fully deploy the proceeds for that purpose, we're taking advantage of this infusion of cash. ","Earlier this month, SCANA redeemed in advance a maturity at par with $150 million 2009 Series A 7.7% Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition, we have delayed long-term debt issuances and are reducing our short-term borrowings. We also turned off the issuance of new shares to supply our 401(K) and DRIP plans earlier this year and anticipate delaying the need for any additional equity issuances until 2017. We don\u2019t currently project the need for any additional equity beyond the new shares provided by the use of 401(K) and the DRIP plan which we will turn on as needed.","Overall, we continue to adjust the financing to match the related CapEx on a 50-50 debt and equity basis. Obviously the construction delay has slowed expenditures, but they were also significantly reduced by lower than anticipated escalation. The delay is a matter of timing, but the escalation on those components already received or completed will result in permanent savings. Any change in the amount or timing of the new nuclear cost would obviously result in changing this plan.","I would now like to discuss our 2015 earnings guidance and related assumptions as shown on Slide 13. First, as you can see on the top left on the slide, we are resetting our base year for our long-term GAAP adjusted average annual growth guidance of 3% to 6% over the next three years to five years off of 2014's GAAP adjusted weather normalized EPS of $3.58 per share. Our 2015 operating plan exclusive of the aggregate gains on the sale of the two subsidiaries would have resulted in $3.74 per share. However we project the 2015 earnings will be negatively impacted about $0.04 per share due to the short term impact of these two sales, while these transactions are expected to yield approximately $0.04 per share of accretion on a long-term basis all of the proceeds can\u2019t be efficiently deployed in the short run to displace equity needs. ","As such we believe there will be downward pressure on 2015 expected earnings which is considered in our guidance. Therefore our 2015 net internal target for GAAP adjusted earnings is $3.70 per share. Our GAAP adjusted earnings per share guidance in $3.60 to $3.80 per share. But due to the cyclical nature of our business we expect to earn approximately 30% of this amount in the first quarter, approximately 25% in each the third and fourth quarters and the remaining 20% in the second quarter. And completing this guidance range we\u2019ve included the impact of a base rate increase from nuclear filing and the BLRA, the 2014 gas RSA filing and our view of the economy. ","This guidance also incorporates the CapEx and financing plans we presented earlier. We continue to assume customer average use of electricity will be slightly lower this year as energy efficiency trends continue to work their way into the market. We anticipate overall weather normalized retail electric sales growth for 2015 to decline by approximately 0.6%. We forecast electric customer growth to be similar to 2014. Operation and maintenance expenses are expected to be relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014 actual. ","Our effective tax rate for 2014 was slightly less than 32% and we estimate the rate for 2015 exclusive of the taxes on the gains of the sales of subsidiaries will be approximately 31%. Hopefully this will provide you with the line of site into our view of 2015 as you update your models. ","Finally, I\u2019ll mention that earlier today we announced an increase in our annual dividend rate for 2015 at $0.08 to $2.18 per share, a 3.8% increase. The result of 2014 and confidence in the long-term strategy were key considerations. We continue to anticipate growing dividends fairly consistent with earnings while staying within our stated paying out policy of 55% to 60%.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Steve to provide an update on our nuclear project.","Steve Byrne","Thanks Jimmy. I want to begin by recapping the preliminary new nuclear construction schedule on cost information we received from the Consortium. As described last week in our quarterly BLRA update filing with the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, the Consortium has indicated the substantial completion date for Unit 2 is expected to occur by June of 2019 and the substantial completion date for Unit 3 maybe approximately 12 months later. We are continuing our discussions with the Consortium in order to identify potential mitigation strategies to possibly accelerate the substantial completion date of Unit 2 to a time earlier in the first half of 2019 or to the end of 2018 with Unit 3 following approximately 12 months later.","As Jimmy previously mentioned we\u2019re in the miss with negotiation process with the Consortium and we cannot predict when the revised schedule and cost estimates will be resolved. Further neither SCE&G nor Santee Cooper has accepted the new preliminary schedule or financial responsibility associated with these delays. We anticipate filling a petition requesting an adjustment to our current capital cost and construction schedules with the public service commission before the end of this quarter. ","Under the BLRA the [plan] has six months to reaching its order. I\u2019d now like to discuss some of the activities at the new nuclear construction site. On slide 14 you can see an aerial photo of the site from December. I have labeled both units 2 and 3 as well as many other areas that make up the construction table top and as you can see progress continue to take place on the project. ","Slide 15 shows where some of the module fabrication has been moved from CB&I\u2019s Lake Charles, Louisiana facility to various other venues in the United States and Japan. Fabrication and the CA03 sub modules continues at the SMCI facility in Florida. ","Newport News Industries in Virginia is fabricating and continues to ship shield building panels to the site. Oregon Iron Works and Toshiba IHI Corporation are the principal fabricators for Unit 3\u2019s, CA-20 and CA01 sub modules respectively. ","On Slide 16 you can see a picture of the Unit 2 nuclear island. In this picture you can see module CA-20 along with the containment vessel Ring 1, which has been placed on the containment vessel lower bowl. The lower bowl is now covered by the auxiliary building walls as they are coming up to what we call elevation 100, which is about 35 feet above the base map. Once elevation 100 has been reached; work will begin on the annex building, which will house the electrical switch gear for plant.","Slide 17 shows a schematic of the modules inside the containment vessel. And here, you can see the locations of modules CA-01, 02, 03 and 05 which we\u2019ll further discuss shortly. ","Slide 18 has an explored view of CA01 through 05 showing where they fits especially inside the containment vessels. Slide 19 shows the recent picture of Unit 2 Module CA01. CA01 houses the steam generators and pressurizer and forms our fueling canal inside the containment vessels. We currently have all 47 sub modules on sight and 34 of those sub modules are up right and being assembled in the module assembly building or MAB. Slide 20, the shipment from Yokohama, Japan of the first in Unit 3, CA01 sub module fabricated by Toshiba which should be on sight in early March.","Slide 21 shows pictures of the Unit 2 Module CA05 this module comprises one of the major wall sections within the containment vessel. On the top right you can see Module CA05 inside of the tent where the final weld is completed prior to placement. On December 6, 2014 this module was lifted with the heavy lift derrick as seen on the left hand side of the slide and placed in a containment vessel as seen on the bottom right hand side of the slide. On slide 22 you can see an area of picture with a good view of the containment vessel rings that are currently being fabricated for Units 2 and 3.","As you can see on the bottom right the Unit 2 containment vessel Ring 1 has been placed on top of the containment vessel lower bowl and Ring 2 is complete and will be set after placement of structural module CA01. Across the top of the picture you can see three other containment vessel rings that are in the process of being fabricated for Units 2 and 3, each unit has a total of 3 ring sections. In addition the steel for the Unit 2 containment vessel top closure head is also on site.","Slide 23 shows the picture of the Unit 3 Nuclear Island here you can see where the containment vessel lower bowl has been placed and their nearest building walls continue to take shape. On slide 24 you can see an arrow picture showing the four low profile four stacked cooling towers. Cooling towers 2 Alpha and 3 Alpha are both structurally complete and you can see the progress continuing on 2 Bravo and 3 Bravo.","On slide 25 you can see one of the two steam generators for Unit 2 that arrived at the construction site on January. The component was transported from the port of Charleston by rail on a specifically designed [snaffle] car. This steam generator weighs approximately 1.3 million pounds, it\u2019s about 20 feet in diameter and it\u2019s almost 82 feet long","Slide 26 shows shield building panels for Unit 2. The shield building surrounds the containment vessel. These panels will be welded together and concrete will be poured inside the panel to create shield building. On left you can see one of the panels up close on the right you can see the lay down yard where we have begun receiving the panels. We currently have received 44 of the 167 Unit 2 panels that are provided by Newport News Industries. I want to also briefly mention the 8-inch explosive of squib bells which are a key component of the passive safety system of the AP1000 design. They\u2019ve recently passed a series of engineering test to determine if they will properly operate under extreme conditions such as high pressure and temperature. That\u2019s great news for the project as it prepares the valves for testing to qualify them versus margins.","On slide 27 you will see the new nuclear CapEx actual and projected over the life of construction. This chart also reflects our company\u2019s current actual and estimated new nuclear CapEx during the years 2008 to 2020 which as Jimmy previously discussed is updated from what we filed in the latest quarterly BLRA report. As you can see the next several years are the peak nuclear construction period, the green line represents the related actual and projected customer rate increases under the BLRA and is associated with the right hand access. As a reminder the incremental 5% future acquisition of the new nuclear project from Santee Cooper will not affect these projected BLRA increases.","Please now turn to Slide 28, as mentioned in our third quarter call in September the public service commission approved a rate increase of 66.2 million. The new rates were effective for bills rendered on or after October 30th. Our BLRA filings for 2015 are shown at the bottom of the slide and as you can see we recently filed our quarterly status report for the fourth quarter.","That concludes our prepared remarks we\u2019ll now be glad to respond any questions you might have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). The first question comes from Andrew Weisel from Macquarie Capital. Please go ahead.","Andrew Weisel","For Steve, if I heard you correctly you said that you will be filing with the commission the updated schedule by the end of the first quarter. Is that in relation to missing the milestone with CA03 Unit 2 or is that a function of your expectation that you will reach the statement with the consortium by then or both are those potentially two separate filings? What\u2019s the strategy around that?","Steve Byrne","Yes the filings really are to update the cost and the schedule. I do not anticipate at this point in time that we will have a settlement with the consortium when we file the update petition by the end of the quarter. I could be surprised but I would not anticipate that happening.","Andrew Weisel","So then what happens if you're in the midst of a review of the already seen delays when you reach your settlement, will that settlement be merging to the same review? Would you have to have a second review?","Steve Byrne","No, I would think that it would -- everything will depend upon timing, but we will file petition, we will have some period of time to generate testimony. We will then have a formal hearing few months later and then its six months from the time we file the commission has to render their opinion. So it depends on when it will happen in that process, but obviously if it were happen before we went to hearing and we could amend the filing of the petition.","Andrew Weisel","And then my other question was you mentioned the goal to stay out of rate cases during peak construction. Now that the peak construction has pushed out a few years and goes through 2017, is that still the hope to avoid a non-nuclear rate increase through 2017?","Steve Byrne","That remains our goal.","Andrew Weisel","Then one last one, when I look at the CapEx schedule you provided in the slides for new nuclear, I compare that to the appendix 2 of the BLRA. And they're usually pretty close, this time it seems like there CapEx numbers are more different than normal. Is there anything unusual going on between those two?","Steve Byrne","Just timing Andrew, so we've just been pulling this altogether very real-time and it's a time we file the BLRA last Friday we knew that we would end up with different information today that will be fairly similar we think to what we file in the update filings Steve mentioned, but we footnoted that in the BLRA that those items will be changing in the near term, so it's just kind of the timing of everything.","Andrew Weisel","So the numbers in the slide are the more up-to-date ones?","Steve Byrne","That's exactly right.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim von Riesemann from Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Jim von Riesemann","Quick question for you, in the press release you talked about the interest savings on the nuclear project. Am I thinking about this correctly that you have roughly 1.2 billion in potential interest rate savings versus the original project cost? So if that stays on plan and let's assume a worst case scenario where the 660 million construction dispute is those against you and the entire things, so that's a real worst case basis. Does that mean you're still into the original project cost and you're going to wind up and the customers are not going to be impacted in anyway?","Jimmy Addison","And this is really the first time we've emphasized those interest savings, so we were really trying to clarify some misunderstanding, some in the financial markets and some in the local area here where our folks really weren\u2019t understanding the escalation saving, so we're projecting as you know in the BLRA somewhere around $575 million of lower escalation today than when we originally started the project. And sometimes they have been confused with lower financing cost.","That lower escalation is just lower escalation on the actual labor and modules et cetera associated with the construction. It has nothing to do with the financing cost. So what we put in the press release is our estimate of the estimated savings over the tenure of the bonds that we have issued and those that we've locked in of the savings that would occur over the life of those, so they're really two different matters. As far as your real question about would be 660 million be offset by the 1.2 billion. I'd say it really be offset dollar-for-dollar by the escalation savings, because those are more in today's dollars, the 1.2 billion are savings to occur over the future of the bonds some 30 plus years.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ashar Khan of Visium. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan","Can I just follow up to a couple of things on earnings? You had mentioned Jimmy into your remarks that the deal would be accretive by about $0.04 by the time you utilize the proceeds. So will that have happened by '16 or '17?","Jimmy Addison","We project it will have happened by the end of '16 based upon the current projected equity needs to finance the project. Of course that's somewhat dependent upon the pace of the project and the construction expenditures, but it will not have happened by the beginning of '16. We're comfortable it will have happened by the beginning of '17 more likely sometime during the year.","Ashar Khan","So that means as we look at '15 to '17 earnings, there will be like a $0.08 shift on this $0.04 dilution going away and then by '17 year a $0.04 accretion coming, am I thinking to that correctly?","Jimmy Addison","Correct.","Ashar Khan","Secondly, you had mentioned that the new schedule that you have presented, this schedule under which the new CapEx in the forecast, under this schedule the rate -- the Unit number one comes online towards the end of \u201819 and Unit number two 12 months later, that is the basis of the projections you\u2019re providing us today, is that correct?","Jimmy Addison","I think what we said was the projection from the Consortium that\u2019s constructing the plan is that the first unit, Unit 2 will come online about mid-2019. So we got June of 2019 date hung on that. So we\u2019re still working on mitigation strategies to try to pull that forward. ","Ashar Khan","Yes, but what you\u2019ve given us today in the slide assumes the mid June of 2019, is that correct, what we have in front of us today.","Jimmy Addison","Yes. Steve, we\u2019re just clarifying in your question you said the end of \u201819, mid-19.","Ashar Khan","Mid-19, okay. And can you just speak about the -- I kind of get mixed up -- so this new schedule which you\u2019re presenting. How much extra cost does this have versus what was in the previous presentation?","Jimmy Addison","There isn\u2019t any increase cost over what we presented previously, remember we presented a range previously and we said first half of \u201819 was tail under the range so we\u2019re calling numbers now that at the tail-end of that range that we quoted last time. But the numbers that we quoted before that the Consortium is asking for I think we gave our 55% share at about 660 million, that number is not changed, also remember though that does not include owners cost or escalation that was reference in $2007. ","Ashar Khan","So those increased cost are not part of these projections yet or are they?","Jimmy Addison","What the Consortium feels like there in title to are not baked into the numbers. So if we take the 660 we may have taken some portion of that and included them in the projection, but certainly not all of it. ","Ashar Khan","Okay. So you have taken your own rough as to what you are responsible for and you\u2019ve included that and the remaining you have left often which you think are not responsible for these numbers.","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s fair, yes.","Ashar Khan","Okay. And that is forecast that you\u2019re going to present to that commission in about five weeks\u2019 time?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, by the end of the quarter we\u2019ll present to the commission, we haven\u2019t nailed down exactly what we\u2019re going to present to the commission yet. So I wouldn\u2019t say that what you\u2019re seeing on these projections is exactly what we\u2019re going to present to the commission.","Ashar Khan","Okay, fair enough. And then if I can just kind of like end up with is that, when is it, by the middle of the year or is it towards the second half of the year that we can expect some kind of settlement of timing?","Jimmy Addison","Ashar, we\u2019d love to be able to tell you that, but the things are going slow. The good news is that we\u2019re still talking, we\u2019re still going back in fourth but they are going much slower than I would have anticipated. So a little vary that forecast that it would happen by the end of the second quarter right now.","Ashar Khan","Okay. Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Weinstein of UBS. Please go ahead.","Michael Weinstein ","Hi guys. Couple of questions, Southern recently gave their estimate of owners costs including financing cost on a monthly basis, I\u2019m just wondering is there any chance that you guys might provide that as well.","Jimmy Addison","You\u2019re looking at four -- that quarter I think two things, one of them was burn rate for owners cost and another one was for financing cost. On the owners\u2019 cost I think you can assume we\u2019re very similar to that. The financing cost however their structure in Georgia, their contract the way they finance is a little different than way we\u2019re financing so I don\u2019t think you can make the assumption of financing cost. But on the owners\u2019 cost the burn rate they quoted you can use roughly the same numbers for us. ","Michael Weinstein ","Thank you. And also separate topic, the South Carolina distributed energy resource program, is there any opportunity for you guys to participate in a solar bills, regulated solar bills in South Carolina.","Jimmy Addison","Yes, there may be some opportunity that\u2019s all being sorted out now. There is process in front of the commission at this time. So there may be some opportunity in there, but it\u2019s really -- that\u2019s limited the whole legislation is aiming for South Carolina as a state to get some good experience with renewables not just sellable, with renewables in general and the goal is for or the requirement really is for 2% to be, 2% of our generation to be in distributed 1% utility, 1% in customer scale in fact 20-20. And we think those are our challenges to get done, but we think we will get them done. But there may be a small opportunity for us to participate in, I expect there will be but I don\u2019t think it will be material to our financial results.","Michael Weinstein ","Thank you so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Travis Miller of Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Travis Miller","Good afternoon. Thank you. Question back on this filing that you\u2019re talking about here by the end of the quarter and time line elements I mean the cost think I can understand you want recovery et cetera. The time line thing is this more of a notification to the commission that the time line is different than originally approved or is there some implication here in terms of regulators looking at that time line that\u2019s outside of what was originally approved and therefore something happens and I would think in worst case something like a per day or something like that? Does the schedule part of it being outside of that original approved band advance have any implication?","Steve Byrne","This is Steve the implications are we have to go through a formal hearing process which is what the application that we would file by the end of the quarter. So in between then and the six months later when an order have to be issued we\u2019ll have a hearing and at hearing we\u2019ll have our opportunity to explain what happened with the public service commission. It would have to really be in prudence before they would deny it and prudency on the part of us the utility, which I think they would be very difficult for anybody to prove. We have done this once before, so we\u2019ve asked for a rebase line of our schedule -- our function path and that was approved by the public service commission by a 7\/0 vote.","Travis Miller","Okay, so if they did rule in prudency based on the schedule delays then that would go into the cost side and potential recovery or not recovery, is that fair to think about as gating factor so to speak?","Steve Byrne","I am not sure it would be a gating factor I am not sure exactly what they might do with it. I don\u2019t think it would be fair to assume they would just say no but is a hearing process and we will have to make our case for why the schedule extension is reasonable which certainly we think we can make. But we will be asking for what we\u2019ve pointed out today so those new schedules. So this is our opportunity to explain that to the commission because we\u2019re not allowed to have conversations with them outside of this formal hearing or an [expartake] briefing process.","Jimmy Addison","And Travis let me just add that that I guess this is obvious to everyone, but what we\u2019ll be presenting is the future not what\u2019s occurred behind us so this is about permission not about asking for forgiveness.","Operator","The next question comes from Paul Patterson of Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson","Most of my questions have been answered, but just a refresh on you were talking to Ashar about this, the accretion associated with the asset sale. You\u2019re going to have a negative $0.04 now and then you\u2019re going to have that reversed and then you\u2019re going to have an accretion of $0.04. Is that correct?","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s correct and maybe I can just summarize another way, one strategy we could have deployed is to take all the cash, fill out and buy back shares today. And if that had happened we would project the earnings for \u201915 would have been $0.08 higher, not $0.04 lower, but we would then back to the 374 + 4 because of the accretion. We didn\u2019t think that strategy made a lot of sense given the valuation of the industry sector given, prices are start today to go out and buy shares today and then go sell shares again 12-18 months later. Just tried to clear that up I thought I\u2019d walk through that.","Paul Patterson","Okay, and then on top of that just aside, the sales growth you guys are projecting is negative 0.6% on a weather adjusted basis. Is that correct?","Steve Byrne","Yes, this year.","Paul Patterson","And now you talked about similar customer growth that you guys had in the past. Is that right?","Steve Byrne","Yes.","Paul Patterson","Okay, and then going forward, I mean it\u2019s a crystal ball kind of question, like a lot of these are, but what do you think longer term -- what do you think the state of growth would be sales growth for you guys?","Steve Byrne","That\u2019s really addressed in our IRP and we expect something just over 1.5% net so a gross would be closer to maybe 1.8% or 2% less energy efficiency and demand side manage was something around 1.6%, 1.5%. We\u2019ll be filing another update to that in a few weeks but we don\u2019t expect a significant change from on a net basis what we filed last year.","Paul Patterson","That\u2019s a pretty significant change on a weather adjusted basis.","Steve Byrne","It is and a lot of that\u2019s really being driven by industrial, number one and number two by these energy efficiency standards really working themselves through the pipeline over the next two to three years. So we feel like that\u2019s being going on two for three years historically and will occur another two or three years. So the view I just gave you on the longer term is a 15 year view.","Paul Patterson","So we probably going to have for the next three to five years -- two or three years not much it\u2019s probably going to be pretty anemic growth, I guess, outside of industrial brands.","Steve Byrne","Exactly, especially residential and commercial.","Operator","The next question comes from Jonathan Reader of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Reader","Jimmy, just want to make sure going back to short -- I fully understand what\u2019s in the 2015 to \u201917 new nuclear CapEx forecast. So that reflects mid-2019 and mid 2020 online dates and perhaps some sort of additional cost responsibility of that 660 million amount that you previously cited, is that correct?","Jimmy Addison","Well on the dates portion yes, on the 660 most of what is in here incrementally relates to our owners cost that roughly can may get month or so that Steve discussed earlier as well as some escalation on that owners cost as well as some minority of the 660 that we feel like is fairly clear-cut that the contortion would be entitled to, but the majority of the 660 is not in these revised numbers.","Jonathan Reader","And then because you're now assuming that June or mid 2019 date is that why you kind of tweaked the language a little bit in the BLRA filings saying about the June? Or should we be thinking if any less likely that you could potentially mitigate some of that scheduled delay at this point?","Jimmy Addison","I think we're been fairly realistic. There are some things that we can yet do to accelerate deliveries of modules that we are going to do. And we bake that into what we're assuming would be additional cost for us, so that's already in those numbers. Some of what you see is a spreading for a couple more of periods or couple more years to reflect these new June and June substantial completion dates or completion dates. Again we haven\u2019t accepted them yet; the contortion is still working to try to improve those, so we're going to exhaust every effort to try to improve those dates, but what we intend to go forward with is the June and June just.","Jonathan Reader","Okay so you guys just go forward with that, it will just give you more flexibility in terms of moving forward with the project, is that the way to kind of think about it?","Jimmy Addison","Correct.","Jonathan Reader","And then last question Steve if you go in a little bit of detail like what was going on at the SMCI facility in Florida, there are issues down there that I guess you felt the need to put a person on the ground monitoring it?","Steve Byrne","Yes we think we've seen some benefit from putting somebody on the ground at the Lake Charles facility and so we want to do it a little earlier at these other facilities, so we have somebody at the SMCI facility, but we're also putting people at other facilities. So we have done and we'll surely have somebody at the NNI facility in Virginia and we have done and we'll surely have somebody at the Oregon Iron Works facility out in Oregon in Portland. So we just think that's an important part of oversight going forward so we don\u2019t repeat the mistakes that were made at Lake Charles and that kind of thing does add to owners cost, so when we say we're adding cost those costs are in what we're forecasting going forward as well and then we'll ask from the commission by the end of the quarter.","Jonathan Reader","So it's just kind of what you see as the best practice type thing and we shouldn\u2019t necessarily be concerned that I guess there's something going wrong down there right now that could be a potential hurdle down the road?","Steve Byrne","I'd be putting the residents in place is really -- it's prudent for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Andy Levi","Just a few questions on the nuke side. Just on the 660 that that's in $2007 is that what you're saying, I know you said that before but I just want to make sure that?","Jimmy Addison","Yes the 660 that we get from the contortion was all referenced in $2007 but that's when our contract was referenced in.","Andy Levi","So is there a way to kind of figure out what the real number is?","Jimmy Addison","Well that's what they gave us the number, so you just have to escalate it from there to get to a present day number, but we haven\u2019t done that yet. We haven\u2019t reported on that yet.","Andy Levi","And then what's the mechanism to fight or cover these costs I guess unrelated to the BLRA, so if you don\u2019t want the rate payers to pay for it? How will you get the money? Or not pay the money or how does it work?","Jimmy Addison","Yes so the best way to get the money back is not to pay in the first place. So the contract has in it dispute resolution provisions, but we're trying to negotiate outside of that right now. And if that were to fail then contract provisions would kick in, but it's basically its mediation, arbitration and net litigation. And so our last guess will be to get to litigation, not saying we won't get there, but we're going to try and negotiate first.","Andy Levi","And then if you do go to litigation route if they announce at the ends of getting that far, you would withhold paying at some point or a portion or do you have like certain threshold that you need to kind of pay as you go?","Jimmy Addison","There are contractually some thresholds that we would have to pay for disputed costs and then there's other categories of things that we just don\u2019t think there's any entitlement to which we would move and obviously want to withhold.","Andy Levi","And that would be to the consortium so whether it's Westinghouse, CBI or Toshiba, that\u2019s who we\u2019re talking about? Or is it only to a certain entity?","Jimmy Addison","Now we can build by the Consortium and we pay the Consortium so they act as an entity, one entity.","Andy Levi","Got it. Okay, thank you very, very much. ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","Just want to make sure I understood one thing, I got a little bit used to it when the discussion came about to including or not including part of this 660 million. The thing I want to make sure is the number, the total number in that CapEx slide that you\u2019re showing today, is that a bigger number than what you showed in the prior quarter slide or was it the exact same number.","Jimmy Addison","Well, I think when you look at as a three year look at CapEx and if you look at the three year period the numbers are very close they are different though in every year so we move the cost around and what you don\u2019t see in the three year look is the expansion out for a couple of more years. So now that are running through 2018 or 2019 we\u2019re now running through 2020. So in the three you don\u2019t necessarily see that. So what we\u2019ve included in the capital forecast going forward would be where we see the normal construction process and our payments based on the Consortium achieving milestones and we\u2019ve added what we\u2019re estimating for increases in owners\u2019 cost and change orders of the consortium that we would dispute. There are some things like cyber security, cyber security rules were not around when the contract was negotiated they changed so we have to account for that.","So we wouldn\u2019t necessarily dispute, the fact we have to pay for cyber and so that would be an example of the change that we will include in the filing with that coming up. So to the extend with those cost will be in the next three years that\u2019s in what you\u2019re seeing and we\u2019ve included number of escalation on our owners\u2019 cost and we have taken what we would call a minimal amount of entitlement. So of that 660 there is a portion of that, that we said we probably would not dispute that so we\u2019ve included that in the cost. But not to bias my negotiating position I\u2019m not going to say exactly what that is.","Michael Lapides","Got it. But if I look at the slide at the end of the presentation which has the full cycle of CapEx to completion, in that slide the numbers that are detailed in the prior and as such in the out years would that change?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s right Michael.","Michael Lapides","When you file that with the commission if you don\u2019t have the settlement with CBI and in Westinghouse, what is it you\u2019re exactly filing? Are you just filing for extension based on the new schedule or are you filing for some other type of labor or approval?","Jimmy Addison","No, we\u2019re going to file based on a schedule that reflects the June of \u201819 and June of \u201820 dates and when we will also file for additional capital cost based on what we know.","Michael Lapides","Okay. And right now do you have a pull from the vendors or from the Consortium integrated project schedule that takes me through completion?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, I\u2019ve got a schedule that you to completion yes. ","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. And that date is June 2019 date, are they giving your full IPF and now it\u2019s a question of what can you mitigate of the IPF?","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s correct.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Andy Levi from Avon Capital Advisors with the follow up. Please go head.","Andy Levi","I apologize; I should have asked this question to begin with. This kind of compare notes like from southern company and all that, just to understand the way their contracts written; again this is me talking, not them talking. And just also understand speaking to Westinghouse, to CBI that if the delay is regulatory delay meaning it caused by the NRC theoretically the plant owner is the one who pays for in Southern\u2019s case, is that also the case with you guys?","Jimmy Addison","Andy our contract has traditional change order type language, so a force-majeure event would trigger change orders certainly if it was a change in the regulation then they will be entire to a change order and it\u2019s a good example that would be cyber security, the regulation changed so we\u2019ve amended the contract to account for that and it will cost us little bit more for cyber security where we would perhaps different with the Consortium is their interpretation what\u2019s call the regulatory driven change and we would not accept that\u2019s the change in the regulations. So we are at odds over that topic. ","Andy Levi","Okay. I\u2019m just talking about whether issues of late trials again it\u2019s a matter of opinion or whatever the delay is if, it\u2019s a delay that in their eyes was caused by the NRC theoretically in their eyes you would be on the hook for that, again you may dispute that and be very correct in disputing in that but that\u2019s kind of how it works?","Jimmy Addison","That correct.","Andy Levi","Okay, and then Southern talked about liquidated damages and they\u2019d be kind of looking to recovery those. Is that kind of your position as well?","Steve Byrne","Yes, our contract has in it liquidated damage provision and I think whenever we\u2019re done, releases our BLRAs and we\u2019ve talked about numbers we\u2019ve pointed out that those are not yet net of liquidated damages.","Andy Levi","Any you haven\u2019t put a number on those liquidated damages, right?","Steve Byrne","We haven\u2019t, no.","Andy Levi","Okay, and then a non-nuclear question I have and this is for Jimmy. On your guidance that you gave, what\u2019s the midpoint or what\u2019s the sales growth assumption there to get to the midpoint of your [CARG]?","Jimmy Addison","So of customers or retail load, retail sales?","Andy Levi","Retail sales.","Jimmy Addison","It\u2019s actually negative 0.6%.","Operator","And we\u2019ve a follow up from Ashar Khan from Visium. Please go ahead.","Ashar Khan","Jimmy could you just -- this is something new which I guess street hasn\u2019t focused on. So could you just outline the savings -- cost escalation savings that you mentioned in the beginning? Where did they arrived from and I forget now which dollar numbers are they and which year\u2019s numbers are they, are they present day\u2019s numbers are they -- could you just explain to me again those savings escalation savings that have occurred over the period of time, could you?","Jimmy Addison","Yes, so to make sure I don\u2019t further confuse it just let me go back so what we\u2019ve been presenting in each BLRA would be the total projected cost each time we file the report each quarter for our 55% share. And we originally, of course we\u2019re improved for $6.3 billion in total future estimated cost and our current projections are just over $0.5 billion less than that about $575 million less. All of those reports to-date have been focused on the lower escalation if you will the lower inflation during the construction period that the consortium was entitled to bill us for based upon publicly available inflation industries associated with construction.","What we put in our press release today has nothing to do with that. That is the financing cost what\u2019s the consortium bills us with whatever the escalation is, how do we go out and finance it on debt side so the equity side is fairly straight forward 50% we financed in equity through the BLRA and 11% ROE. The 50% that we financed with debt we\u2019re doing with first mortgage bonds. We had originally estimated in our BLRA filing based upon our embedded cost of debt at the time. A debt of about 6.4% whereas overall we issued bonds at slightly under 5% life to-date on the project and all of those are fixed rate bonds.","And so what we\u2019ve disclosed is we estimate that the savings on those over the life of the bonds will be $700 million about $20 million a year and then additional bonds that we expect issue in the next two years that we\u2019ve already hedged the rate on we estimate to save another 500 - 25 million on those over the life of those bonds. So that\u2019s the 1.225 billion in interest savings we expect to occur over the life of those bonds that are outstanding and completely independent of the escalation to lower inflation on the construction as well.","Ashar Khan","So if I understand correctly the project currently from the date started is coming in current dollar, 500 or 75 or whatever the number is below projected cost as you stand today. And so we created because of lower inflation or management or whatever, a cushion of $575 million from the initial estimates that we gave to the commission. And that is in the pocket I guess the rate peers of South Carolina are going to benefit from that which has already occurred. And now I guess the next step is what is the additional cost which has to be of course settled with the consortium which would be on the project from that lower estimated cost that we are currently on.","Jimmy Addison","That\u2019s almost --.","Ashar Khan","In essence we could come out pretty close to or slightly above there is no cost that we started off at?","Jimmy Addison","We could -- one minor clarification of what you just said the 500 million or so that we\u2019re projecting to be below at this point some of that has already occurred some of it is what we project to happen between now and the completion of the project. So not all of that has occurred yet with that lower escalation, escalation could be even lower in the future, it could be higher in the future. So that could change between now and the completion.","Ashar Khan","Okay, that\u2019s further great news. So how much can you tell me, how much of that is banked and how much is not banked?","Jimmy Addison","You know I don\u2019t have that in my fingertips Ashar, but it's I think it's available in our public filing and I'll have IR file assuming it is.","Ashar Khan","And second if I can end up, Jimmy now based on the spending being moved a little bit further out and reducing the equity needs and of course now you have lowered the pace and all that. When can you be in a situation and you've been growing more on the kind of in the higher portion of the growth rate, when can you be in the situation of moving the growth rate upwards?","Jimmy Addison","I don\u2019t know the answer to that question if that will occur or when it will occur, we continually evaluate our look and I would say that really the wild card in that is the whole issue we've discussed with two or three Q&As today around base on electricity consumption. So if it were just a matter of modeling in the BLRA it'd be fairly simple to answer that question, you could kind of model it after the peak construction years, but when the foundation of the business is changing somewhat even though it's only 0.06% negative when you've got 700,000 customers you're projecting to use slightly less, that makes it difficult to answer your question. So we updated it best to our experience each year and at this point we still feel like it's our best estimate.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jimmy Addison, SCANA's Chief Financial Officer for any closing remarks.","Jimmy Addison","Well thank you. 2014 was certainly a very unusual year relative to weather, but aside from the weather, we're very pleased with our underlying economic growth, the operation of our businesses and the refinement of our focus around our core retail businesses. Accordingly, we're really optimistic about our future. And finally I mentioned that Steve and I will be on the road the first week of March in New York and Boston at investor conferences and we hope to see many of you there. Thank you for joining us today and for your interest in SCANA.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect. "]}}
