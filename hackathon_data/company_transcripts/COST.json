My name is Jodie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco's Q2 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","Thank you. I would now like to turn today's conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO of Costco. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Jodie. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our second quarter and first half fiscal 2014 operating results for the 12 and 24-week periods ended February 16th, and our monthly sales results for the four-week reporting month of February, which ended this past Sunday, March 2nd.","The discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, our 12-week second quarter, for the quarter we reported earnings of a $1.05 a share. This compared to last year's second quarter earnings reported at $1.24. As noted in this morning's release, our last year's earnings figure was positively impacted by a $52 million or $0.14 per share income tax benefit that was in connection with the portion of the special cash dividend we paid in December of '12 to company 401(k) plan participants.","Several factors impacting our second quarter earnings beyond that, these included lower sales and gross margins in hardlines, most particularly during the four-week holiday period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, lower year-over-year gross margins in fresh foods, the FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations. This represented, if you assumed, no change year-over-year in the currency exchange rates, about $23 million pre-tax or little over $0.03 a share.","For example, this year in Q2, versus year ago, the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollars is down 8% and Japan about 15%. In addition, an income-tax rate, even after excluding that tax benefit I just mentioned, that was still 1.5 percentage points higher year-over-year in the second quarter. Last year in Q2, as I had mentioned there were a couple of positive discrete items that had lowered last year's rate by about $10 million or $0.02 a share.","As well in both, this year's and last year second fiscal quarter, there were few other discrete items that in the aggregate represented a year-over-year negative swing to our SG&A expenses by about 5 basis points, or $0.02 a share.","While earnings results for the first four weeks of Q2 were very weak, our earnings in the subsequent eight weeks of the second quarter showed improvement. In terms of sales for the quarter, total sales were up 6% and on a comp basis up 3%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation as well a bigger impact by weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar year-over-year. That alone was about $200 basis points.","Excluding gas, the reported 4% U.S. comp in Q2 would have been plus 5%abd the reported flat international comp, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 7%, such that the total company, which we reported, again the 3% comp for the quarter, excluding gas and would have been plus 5.","For the four-week month of February, which included the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter, comps came in at a plus 2%. This consisted of a plus 3% reported in the U.S. and a minus 1, internationally. Again gas deflation and FX had an impact, such that the 3% reported U.S. comp increase for February would have been a plus 4% and the minus 1% international, excluding same FX change rates year-over-year would been plus 5% and the total company, the plus 2%, that we reported would been a plus 4%.","I now mentioned, which I have not been quite a while, weather. It has been all over, particularly in the U.S., snow, rain, just crazy weather. We estimate that the weather impact to February sales results represented about one percentage point hit to the four-week reporting period.","In terms of new openings, after opening 13 new locations in the first quarter as well as closing our Acapulco, Mexico location due to the hurricane damage, we opened three new locations in the second quarter, two in the U.S., one each in Illinois and Texas and one also in Ontario, Canada. All told that puts our fiscal 2014 openings through the second quarter at 16 new locations and we now operate 649 locations around the world. And between now and the end of fiscal 2014, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, three in the third quarter and 11 in the fourth quarter. These 14, which again, this will be before fiscal year end on August 31, six are planned for the U.S., two additional locations in each of Japan and Korea and one each in Canada, U.K, Australia, and of course our first location opening in Spain in Seville in the spring, such that we would expect to end the year with 30 new openings for the year.","This morning, I will review with you, of course, our membership trends and renewal rates, our e-commerce activity and of course, additional discussion about margins and SG&A. To start off, again sales, total sales were up to $25.7 6 billion, up 6% year-over-year and comps, again was reported plus 3% and a plus 5$, excluding gas and FX. In terms of the plus 3% reported comp sales, the average transaction was minus 1% for the quarter on a reported basis. Again FX has impacted that as well. It would have been a little over 1% plus with on a local flat currency year-over-year.","Average frequency was a little over 4% for the three recent months. Frequency was just under 4%, just under 5% and just under 3% for December, January, February and year-to-date shopping frequency continues to be in the 4.25% range.","In terms of sales by geographic region, both for the 12 week quarter and the four weeks of February, geographically Southeast, Midwest and San Diego regions were strongest. Internationally as well, both for the quarter, the four weeks of February, the strongest regions in local currencies where Mexico and Canada.","For the second quarter, in terms of merchandise categories, within food and sundries, overall in the low single digits. For hardlines, overall in the mid-single digits. Within that, we are asked about electronics that were slightly positive for the quarter overall. Within the mid-single-digit comp range for softlines, and then fresh foods up in the mid high single digits, overall, with produce being strongest.","For February, again, the traffic was up just under 3% shopping frequency. Again the reported average transaction was down about a little over 1%. But again big impact from gas and FX. In fact, just during the month of February, year-over-year, the average sell price gasoline was down about 10% for the month per gallon.","From a merchandising category standpoint, food and sundries, overall was in the low single digit range, hardlines overall came in slightly negative with electronics being down in the mid-single-digit range, softlines was the strongest area in the mid to high single-digit range, and finally fresh foods mid-single-digit range overall. Again, produce being typically strong.","In terms of moving down the income statement. In terms of membership fees, $550 million, up from 4% or $22 million from a year earlier of $528 million. Again you have got the impact of FX. If we assume flat year-over-year FX, that reported $550 million membership fee number would have been $563 million or up 7% year-over-year","In terms of membership, our renewal rates continued at record levels and we continue to see increasing penetration of the executive membership.","New membership signups in the second quarter companywide were up 13% year-over-year, again, mostly reflective of very strong signups some of our international openings, including recent new openings in Japan and Australia.","In terms of number of members, Gold Star, we ended the first quarter three month, 12 weeks ago at $29.6 million at Q2 and it was $30.1 million.","Business primary rounded both, Q1 end at $6.7 million. Business add-on at $3.5 million each, so all told, $39.8 million at Q1 end up to $40.3 million at Q2 end, including the additional card $72.5 million at Q1 end was up about $900,000 to $73.4 million at Q2 end.","Also at second quarter end, paid executive memberships were just over 14 million, an increase of almost 200,000 since Q1 end, or about 16,000 week in the quarter, and again executive members are roughly 35% of sales in a little over two-thirds of our sales. 35% of our membership base and a little over two-thirds of our sales.","In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, continue to tweak up a little bit. At Q1 end, business memberships renewal rates were 90:1, at Q2 end it was 90:3 Gold Star 89:3 went to 89:6, so all told, 90.2 up to 90.4 and of course that's U.S. and Canada are 80% of our company in our most mature markets.","Worldwide, including all the new countries, over the last several years, 86:5 went to 86.8, so again continuing good trends in membership renewal rates.","Going down to the gross margin line, we were down year-over-year 6 basis points in the quarter from a 10.59 down to 10.53. Again as I always do ask you to jot down the following four columns and six line items to give you a little explanation of components of margin.","The first two columns would be the Q1 '14, reported and Q1 '14, excluding gas deflation. Columns three and four would be Q2 reported and column four would be without gas deflation Q2.","Going across, our merchandise core reported in Q1 was up 12 basis points year-over-year, but excluding gas deflation was up three, but again continuing across reporting Q2 was plus 1 and without gas deflation minus 1.","Ancillary, plus 5 and plus 2 reported and without gas in Q1 and zero and zero in columns three and four. 2% reward, minus 3 and minus 2. Then in the second quarter, minus 1 and minus 1. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1, and in the second quarter minus 6 and minus 6.","Other, which I don't need to add here zeros across the columns there. All told, in total, in Q1 '14, we reported year-over-year gross margin up 13 basis points, but taking out the effective gas deflation up, it was up to. Again, today we reported minus 6 and lower margins year-over-year in the second quarter. Without gas deflation, it would have been minus 8.","As you can see, again, the minus 6, minus 8 without gas deflation, and our core was essentially flat, plus 1, minus 1 with and without gas deflation. For the second quarter, year-over-year, food and sundries and softlines gross margins were up in the second quarter year-over-year in the 5-basis point to 20-basis point range, while hardlines and fresh foods margins were lower year-over-year in the minus 30 to minus 50 basis points range.","Ancillary business gross margins percentages were essentially flat year-over-year, but again you have got sales impact of a 10% year-over-year lower, the gallonage comp, gallonage in terms of price of gas. The impact of the increasing executive membership, again, 1 basis point hit. Just meaning more dollars going to their rewards based executive membership program.","In terms of LIFO, in the second quarter, we recorded a $5 million pre-tax charge this year in the quarter. That compares to a $9 million pre-tax credit last year, so year-over-year a $14 million or $0.02 a share swing now is 6 basis points year-over-year negative.","As I said when there either a LIFO credit or LIFO charge or this type of swing positive or negative, the fact is, is we really look at as part of quarter given that they work in tandem.","Moving down to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q2 over Q2 were higher or worse by 13 basis points coming in at 9.83% is percent of sales compared to 9.70% last year. The minus 13 translates to minus 10 ex-gas deflation. And again we will put down for us to put down the four columns and in this case five line items. Again, Q1 for two columns, Q1, both reported and then ex-gas deflation and then Q2 reported an ex-gas deflation.","Going across, core operations was a minus 9% in Q1 reported. I mean been higher by 9 basis points, zero without gas deflation. And Q2 was a minus 12% and a minus 9%. Central in Q1 was a minus 3% and minus 2%, both zero and zero in Q2. RSUs or stock compensation, minus 5% and minus 5% in Q1 and minus 1% and minus 1% in Q2. Quarterly adjustments were zeros across the board. And then total was a minus 17% year-over-year higher SG&A Q1 reported, but again ex-gas deflation was a minus 7% and in Q2 two reported minus 13% becomes a minus 10% that I just mentioned.","In terms of these SG&A figures, the core operations, again was a minus 12%, but minus 9%, ex-gas deflation. Within core, our payroll's percentage sales was higher year-over-year by two basis points. Payroll benefits or workers' comp combined SG&A by about a basis point. And utilities, of course, while cold-weather was higher by two basis points.","Again, as I mentioned earlier, in both this year's and last year second fiscal quarter, we had a few discrete items that in the aggregate represented a year-over-year swing in our SG&A expense by five basis points or $14 million or $0.02 a share. That generally is the luck of the draw. Sometimes that helps us. Sometimes that hurts us. But it was a net negative year-over-year swing. In central, it was flat year-over-year, notwithstanding ongoing IT modernization costs which will continue which represented about a three basis point higher year-over-year hit to SG&A.","Next on the income statement line is preopening. Last year, it was $6 million. It is up $2 million to $8 million this year. In the last year, we had five openings and this year we had three, but some of that's the timing of openings, preopening impacts several months. A big chunk of it also is the more significant preopening expense related to our upcoming opening in Spain as we essentially are opening a new country.","All told, operating income in the second quarter came in at $724 million year-over-year down 2% from last year's $738 million. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher year-over-year by $1million, coming in at $26 million this year versus $25 million last year. Virtually all of that is interest expense related to not only the $1.1 billion fixed rate 5.6% interest that we have that will a mature in March 2017, but also the $3.5 billion debt that we issue last December, which has a weighted average in the low 1% range.","Interest income and other was higher year-over-year by $4 million of the quarter coming in at $30 million this year versus $26 million last year. Actual interest income was about half of that $4 million increase, $2 million higher year-over-year and the other component was $2 million swing, $5 million plus last year versus $3 million plus this year. So that's $2 million better year-over-year.","Overall, pretax income was down 1.6% or $11 million in the second quarter, down from $739 million to $728 million this year. Our tax rate for the quarter came in at 35.0%. Last year it was 25.1%, and as discussed earlier, a big chunk of that was the income tax benefit from that $62 million benefit in conjunction with the special cash dividend. Excluding that one-time benefit, our tax rate last year in Q2 that 25.1% would have been 33.5%. Still lower when compared to this year's 35.0%.","Again, as I mentioned in last year's second quarter conference call, there were a couple of positive discrete items that went our way in Q2 last year to the tune of about $10 million after-tax benefit to tax line or $0.02 a share last year that we didn't have a benefit of this year. Overall reported net income of $547 million last year in Q2. Excluding that $62 million income tax benefit, it would have been $485 million and that compares to our $463 million this year, down a little bit.","Next, in terms of balance sheet, which is included in this morning's press release, I will note a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the second quarter was $240 million and $471 million year-to-date. Accounts payable, as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis, year-over-year is down from 98% to 93%, although some amount of that is in the payables calculation is non-merchandise payables, such as most importantly construction payables, so looking at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories, the 87% last year would and 83%.","Average inventory per warehouse was up about 4%, about $500,000 from $12.2 million to $12.7. This increase was pretty much spread over all the departments, nothing that really stood out. Overall, our inventories are in good shape as well as our mid-year fiscal inventories which we do at the end of the second quarter were essentially tied to last year's best ever results in terms of our low shrinkage results, so I think in our view a good indication of the inventories being managed pretty well.","In terms of capital expenditures, in the first quarter of '14, we had spent $574 million. In the quarter just ended, we spent an additional $447 million, so all told just a little over $1 billion year-to-date.","Total CapEx for fiscal '14, we would expect to be approximately $2.3 billion. I think it's a little up from what I mentioned a quarter ago, reflect from $2.1 billion last year and again reflecting a little ramp up in openings.","In terms of e-commerce operations, we had four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and most recently few months ago, we entered e-commerce, we began e-commerce operations in Mexico.","For the second quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. How? Well, we do not shared the profit stuff, specifically the sales were up 20%. In fact a little higher given the local currencies, given Canada about 20% year-over-year.","Over the past one, one-and-a-half years, as you know we have re-platformed the site. We have added some mobile apps and we have combined some e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts, we have added a few categories to e-commerce, most recently apparel, and some health and beauty aids, we have improved the timing of shipments by shipping out of three depots instead of one.","We are currently testing (Inaudible) e-commerce operations, but we are testing in the Bay area one of several retailers with the Google Express, and we are also testing a few other things that we will let you know more about as we do it.","Next on discussion was expansion. Again, we opened 13 in Q1, we have that closed in Acapulco with the hurricane, so net of 12. In Q2, three, in Q3, three, in Q4 11, so 30 openings less the Acapulco closing so far that will put us a net increase for the year of 29, which would be about 4.5% square footage growth, 4.5% to 5%.","New locations by country for the 30 openings, 17 in the U.S. three in Canada, one in the U.K., two each in Korea and Japan, three in Australia and one each in Mexico and Spain. As of second quarter end, our square footage stood at 93,098,000 square feet.","In terms of dividends, our current recorded dividend stands at $0.31 a share, 1.20, 4% share annualized dividend represents total cost to company of about $540 million. Lastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, May 29th, that will be for the 12-week quarter ending on May 11th.","Before turn it back to Jodie, one comment about Q3 I do want to make, last year in Q3, we had mentioned that there was a litigation settlement that benefited last year's third quarter gross margin results by about $17 million pre-tax or about $0.250 a share, so will be up against that comparison, of course.","Let me just say that overall, I hope that you understand little bit about the factors impacting results this fiscal quarter, how the earnings performance trended positively during the quarter from a very tough first four-week period and a continuing strength in sales, comps shopping frequency and alike.","With that, Jodie, I will turn it back over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Hi. Good morning, Richard. I was wondering if you could just discuss little bit of your current thoughts on buyback. Then separate question, any thoughts on international membership fees and whether or not they do for\u2026","Richard Galanti","In terms of buyback, again, while we let you guys know once a quarter when we have our quarterly earnings announcement. Our intention is to start buying back stock this quarter. We continue to look at it, but I think it's a good statement to say that we will be buying something quarter.","As it relates to international, we are always looking at membership fees. You know us. We tend to be long-term focused and when things are very strong over there, we want to keep pushing for even more memberships. We have the added benefit in most countries of being the only club operator and we will continue to use that benefit to look at it, but we are not in any hurry to do that.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","And then just lastly on the expense leverage or expense deleverage in the quarter. Obviously FX is hurting a little bit, but where do you think the level is this year for expense leverage in terms of the comp? Where you need to be on a reported basis? Is it still close to the 5?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think so, recognizing nothing is perfect. You take those things that I pointed out that in the aggregate we are five basis points. And not trying to be cute here but there is there is always those things that add up or offset each other and this quarter, year-over-year, they didn't. That's five of it.","The other thing is, the biggest impact to our numbers were in those first four weeks. It's a combination of things. I think probably we budgeted it a little aggressively. Our numbers are still not bad for December for that four-week period. But there was four, five less Christmas shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas just based on how Thanksgiving was that fell this year.","The other thing is that FX had a little less to do with it because that affects all the line items, both sales and the margin dollars, but I think some of it also is, while sales overall were satisfactory, they were little less than satisfactory in things like certain non-food seasonal categories were light. It was stronger in fresh meats. So again, as we mentioned fresh foods margins were down more and then you have the double whammy in some of the non-food categories.","So on this level sales we had now, those types of things make a big difference. And again, I think overall, our margins were a little lower than we had planned, but some of it was very conscious, as you know, in some of the fresh food areas.","And to get back to the leverage question, yes, I think a 4 to 5 should be able to do it but we had a few anomalies this quarter as well.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","So, Richard, I wanted to drill down a little bit on the fresh food category. The margin pressure, how broad-based is that? Or was that a handful of items? And what could you call out among items? And then, is that more you making proactive investments or delaying price pass-through?","Richard Galanti","It's almost all us. I would say is, aggressively it is all us. In terms of where it is, as you might expect, it's particularly in the proteins. We talked about chickens before. We have held the price on that chicken. Those 65 or 70 million rotisserie chickens are just part of the chicken. It is also frozen and fresh. And we are seeing a little relief in some of the pricing there in some of the costing. And that's just starting. I think it's starting a little later than we did six months ago, but we should see a little bit of relief there.","Really beyond that, I don't hear, meat is very competitive. Meat is at an all time high in some categories and that's raining on everybody. Beyond that, sometimes in produce, we have a little issue. Produce was the strongest. It depends when it hits and some of the shortages that impacts us a little bit, but overall, I would say meat, pork and poultry is the biggest culprit there and it's mostly us.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","As a follow-up to that, when you look at having some more consistent markups than others, how do you guys think about strategically, right, because you are strength in perishables, we can or should operate with a somewhat lower margin, because we get that traffic, right, which then feeds into all of the higher ticket non-foods you might sell. Will that hold us to get other culture or not really?","Richard Galanti","Well, that's part of the approach, but you again without trying to be too granular here, clearly the comment about how the impact of margins and P&L, of course, in the first four weeks versus the subsequent eight weeks that was dramatic. Part of that again was seasonal markdowns, both being aggressive and proactive and with little less sales in some areas.","While TVs overall, I think, in the quarter were pretty good. You have got other areas. cameras industry-wise are down quite a bit as you might expect with everybody using smartphones, laptops, desktops, tabs as well, so there is some of that pressure and then that I really think that we probably budgeted a little off given the five few days, but at the end of the day it is hard to know whether there is - other than I can tell you is a heck a lot more was it if it was in those first four weeks, so trend wise that is good, but that doesn't tell you anything about the upcoming quarter, other than what we know that February was a little impacted by whether, so we are starting off quarter in those first two weeks. Last two weeks, February, which is first two weeks Q3\u2026","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Then lastly would you say, when you look at either gross margin or fresh food, some of the individual categories, I imagine there is a fair bit of difference country-to-country or not, and you know, is there more pressure outside the U.S. or less?","Richard Galanti","I would say overall there is lot less pressure outside the U.S. The U.S. is fairly the most competitive with regard to the club business as well as competitive with supermarkets are probably the most competitive U.S. compared to later change everywhere, so certainly that is the case, but you know U.S. is little over 70% of our company.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Good morning, Richard. Just a follow-up on that last question, when you think about the progression of your margin performance and it getting better throughout the quarter, the hardline margins getting better, I guess, intuitively makes sense as you move away from the holiday markdowns, but I was wondering if you could discuss, I guess, if that's the case. Then two, was the same true for fresh foods? Did the margins in that category also improved as you progressed throughout 2Q?","Richard Galanti","I believe they did a little bit, but again world, as you know, we are all about being competitive out there and being proactive in that, but we also want to make money and we want to hopefully show some improving margins, but we are going to do what's right and each day on pricing irrespective of how it could impact margin that day.","Overall, clearly, we looked at first four weeks and we took some actions and I can't tell you where, but it showed some relative improvement and that we feel good about that again this quarter is a new quarter and other than sales starting off a little weaker, we will see where it goes. Then a lot of that I think is weather, I mean, trend in the Midwest and Northeast in the Mid-Atlantic, the rain last week, I am not trying to make excuses, but it's been unbelievable.","Japan, we had several locations actually closed for a few days, which is now the [nobody ever had], so lots of little things. I will try to not remind you next year when we chose a little better.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Just a follow-up to Dan's question earlier, when you sit down with the board every month and every quarter, what exactly did the push back to at least in your balance sheet and getting more aggressive what is the thought process currently amongst the board?","Richard Galanti","I think, it is the topic that we always talked about. I don't think there was a pushback either way. As you know, we did little over $3 billion payout to the shareholders via the special dividend last year as the stock was ever increasingly strong.","As I noted in a couple of the analysts, before the market opened comments, we have been a little under consensus expectations although that's not a direction, clearly Q2 was a larger gap there. Again, I think my comment that we plan to buy some this quarter is a step in that direction.","I don't want to be coy or cute about it, but we will let you know in the quarter, but we will be buying some and we will go from there. The board is, as you know, we have never looked at it as let's do this because it will be a positive message to the market, but long-term, I think the board, as I am, are positive about our company and certainly it is accretive but at the same token, we try to be judicious about it. And perhaps we have been a little conservative but we also had the $3 billion dividend last December that helps us be a little conservative. And I think you will see that change some.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay, good, and then this is my last question and I will pas it on. Just on the price investments, I know you guys have been doing it religiously for as long as I can remember. I am wondering with some the new technologies you are putting in place, are you studying it a little bit more closely? Do you feel like the elasticity is there to justify the increasing price investments for U.S.?","Richard Galanti","We would never look at it that way. We are out there, I think, again getting back to the simple circuit example, it's not unlike the hot dog example of years gone by. When prices went up, we just saw that as the strength of that and the growth and the number of tickets we are selling, that gets people in. We don't study and say what if we took it to $549 million and we have this many fewer shops or whatever. We know it's the right thing to do.","Again, I think, Q4 and Q2 and that first four-week period, it exacerbates everything because you had all those things, some weaker sales and some bigger ticket items. Some margins on top of the ongoing fresh foods margins and I am very emphatic about the fact that our fresh foods margins are us, our pricing and we will see some an improvement there but rally when we feel good about it.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Hi. Good morning, Richard. Just to go back to the comments you made about expenses. Maybe you can just help us, provide a little bit more clarity on how we should think about that going forward? Maybe an update on where you are on the IT modernization process? Anything else of note on healthcare, payroll and some of the other items?","Richard Galanti","Well, on IT, I think now it has been about six quarters that have mentioned it, and there is on average as far as I remember something about 4 basis point and so that quarters five and six in this last, they were 4 or top of 4 or on top of 5 or whatever. And that will probably continue for another half dozen quarters. It's a five or so year effort with at least a three-year buildup in those types of things. There will be some quarters on a year-over-year basis when there is couple basis points and there will be some when it's 4 or 5, depending on when systems are being input.","But we have a lot going on. We are excited about, the user groups are excited about some of the things they are seeing. We are going to just start implementing some of the components of it starting in early summer to late summer. Again, I am not going to try to be cute or coy here. It will take some time but we have got a lot going on.","Again, a part of that is affected for 25 years. We pride ourselves on having very simple system and they are still simple, probably relative to others. For us, it's an entire effort and again so far so good. But we are a year and half into it. So that's going to still hit us for at least another year, maybe even longer on that line.","Beyond that, in terms of SG&A, something its just how the numbers work in terms of the fact that you have got your FX, a lower weighted average of countries where some of the payroll percent or percentage of the sales of those respective countries and certainly the healthcare systems in those countries is a little lower weighted average when you have got Canada rate down 8% year-over-year. The Canada exchange rate. We have got Japan in Q2 down 15%, Japan Yen. Australia is down 14.5% year-over-year in the second quarter.","So all those things add, well, insult to injury. The underlying numbers, they were a little worse in terms of expense percentages, but big chicks of this were in the things that I mentioned. And again, there is lots of little things and they all seem to hit at the same time on top of the fact that, in the quarter where you get a lot of leverage, in the four-week period where we get a lot of leverage, it was a little weaker than planned.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Understood., and then, I hope you can just comment on inflation, deflation. What you are seeing across various categories? Just how we should think about LIFO if you think that will still be a factor in 3Q like we saw here in the second quarter.","Richard Galanti","Well, if I compared it to year end just our entire LIFO for mid-year, it is up about a 0.25%, so just like cost of all items, there was $100 item that we paid $100 for it at September 1st, if you will.","February 16th, we were paying on average about $100.25. As you would expect that there is some deflationary pools like computers, what have you, you have got probably the most inflation in food and sundries, little over 1%, you got a shade of gas inflation although that's ticking down right now a little bit.","Overall, there doesn't seem to be a lot of deflation, but on a $4 billion plus LIFO, LIFO is a U.S. concept only, so on a $4 billion plus probably $5 billion LIFO pool, 1% would be $50 million a 0.25% will be 12.5. I do not think it is should be lot and I do not have in front of me last year's LIFO numbers for Q3 and Q4. Not that is treasury thing that in Q3 and Q4.","Last year in Q3 and Q4 LIFO was a credit, a benefit of about $8 million, $7.5 million $8 million in each of Q3 and Q4, so if it is a little inflationary we will see a similar trend of swing that we saw in Q2, but we will wait and see.","Mind you, when there is a LIFO charge, there is probably a little - Again I look at combination that with the core to, because they tend to work not always but in tandem one closing the other, so not a lot of inflation.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","That is helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, so two questions. First, and as you model out FX at the end of the period, when you think that the FX might stop turning to sort of a flat scenario the total comp versus the core comps?","Richard Galanti","I do not know and I am not even a student of some of this foreign exchange stuff, but you know when you see as an example, Japan first quarter year-over-year was down 20% second quarter year-over-year was down 15% for us in terms of the Japanese yen, so there has been a lot of weakening. At some point it's going to bounce back a little bit, but I can't tell you when.","Canada has been awfully strong for many years. It is now subsiding a little bit, but who knows and then adds back the craziness in the world with events that could impact these numbers.","Usually, when there is world issues going on, the dollar strengthened and I think that's a little bit of what's happening now, but also particularly in the case of Canada. I remember 20 years ago when Canadian dollar was $0.65 on the U.S. dollar has actually gotten above $1 for the U.S. dollar and it's come down a little bit, so kind of bounced after that peak, but I can't tell you when that's going to be.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Okay. Then just as a follow-up. The ancillary business, the margins in that business had been a positive for quite some time and it looks like if I got the numbers right, if it was flat this quarter what piece of the business is, is changing and is there anything you could send out the outlook?","Richard Galanti","A lot of it has to do with gas deflation, just weighted average of that chunk. Mind you, gasoline sales as a percent of our company total sales is 11% or 12%, and so we think it is a huge chunk and we have got gas deflation. Our reported gross margin is in the whatever tend to have plus range, 10% to 11% range. Within that number, gas is in 1% to 5% range every quarter, so that weighted average coming down it has an entitlement number, so you got to look at it both ways.","Overall, ancillary businesses were fine, no pharmacy business continued strong. Our hearing aid business although small is very strong. One-hour photo as you would expect continues to be a little weaker because nobody pictures, but we have been a little creative over there trying to do a few other things, but it's still very profitable, but not as profitable as it used to be. So you add it all up, gas deflation was probably the biggest reason.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Okay, perfect. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller from William Blair.","Mark Miller - William Blair","Hi. Good morning, Richard. You gave us some additional detail this quarter on the four week versus the eight week and I want to make sure we had the right impression from this. Given you said that the margins, if I heard this right, on hardlines and fresh foods being down 30% to 50%. Does that mean in the remaining eight weeks of the quarter, you would have actually had gross margin up overall? And is it a fair impression that without those first four weeks, your earnings were closer to about double-digit growth range?","Richard Galanti","The first four weeks, well, one of the things we talked about in the press release was those hardline categories that was more impactful in the first four-weeks, whereas fresh foods is more, again, us and continues to be in the quarter.","But the 30% to 50% range for those types of categories that were down year-over-year was for the entire quarter. I don't have the detail by period here but directionally I would think the first four weeks was worse. It clearly showed some improvement to it.","Mark Miller - William Blair","All right. Has Costco done market research looking at the number of your members that also have an Amazon Prime membership and do your merchants have any sense for how much this might be impacting spending at Costco? Do you think that might have been a bigger factor in the holidays with gift giving? Or you think that it's not a material change?","Richard Galanti","Actually, I think some of you guys out there do more surveying of that than we do. And honestly, I have read some research out there that talks about the overlap. There is overlap. My guess is, clearly in areas like the books and CDs, that a changed business over the last many years. TVs, frankly, we are not bad, overall, and particularly if you add e-commerce to our in-line, we are up a shade for the quarter. I can't tell you what happened in the four weeks of February because they were, what we call majors or electronics, it was down in the mid-single digits year-over-year. But for overall, we probably fared better than most in line and all that stuff takes away a little bit.","We are looking at ways to get, as we have now for a while, to get younger people here as well. We recognize that. And we will continue to do that. But I know, the answer is no. There is not a lot of discernible concern at this point of that.","Mark Miller - William Blair","Okay. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Hi, thanks for taking my question. I will start by just something off from the last question about trying to get younger people in to the warehouses. Can you talk a little bit about what it is you have done or would consider doing to make that happen? What tools to you have?","Richard Galanti","Well, first and foremost, we are not going to do anything rash, but we are also not gong to have us end here. One of things, the test as an example with Google among several retailers but in the Bay Area, has been interesting. I am not going to, again, talk about the detail yet. We have done a few things with some of the similar social media things out there.","One of the impacts which is, what we do is the rise in organic. It's a big business. It's growing fast. We can actually show a better savings on those bigger ticket price point items. And we have seen that time and again, whether it's organic grown beef or those giant packs of kale or you name it and no, I mean we were doing huge business of that. And that also is driving in some younger people.","One of the first systems going in our modernization effort is that a new membership system which we will start rolling out in the U.S., I believe in June, July. And again, there will be a lot more bells and whistles, but as you know, our systems have been pretty basic and primitive and we are not going to go crazy overnight on it, but we are doing a few things and it works and we will keep doing some of those things, so that is what I can tell you at this point.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. Thank you. Then I just have sort of a bigger picture question. It's obvious that it's your philosophy to provide very great value, especially in fresh foods to your customers and you will absorb some inflation, but what do you do? I mean, everything I have seen - meat has been inflationary for a while, especially beef.","Do you have to sit down and think about your strategy, it looks like there are items that are just going to be . Good morning think about do your strategy if it looks like there are other than that of and be inflationary for the long time.","Richard Galanti","Well, part of the answer is no. We do what we do and part of it that was we also recognize that we need to you - our goal was to maximize shareholder value and ultimately that comes into long-term driving earnings and, but we are not going to necessarily do something in the short-term a given quarter to do that.","Again looking at Q2, it was a combination. I think I probably said six or nine months ago, using it simple check-in example that may seem that there seem to be few months looking forward six to nine months ago that that pull through pricing, the costing list can improved which would improve our margins because we are not lowering the price we just not raised it prior to that. That's finally starting to happen, so those are the kind of thing that we will do.","Strategically, at the end of the day, we have got to show improvement on bottom line. Ultimately, it is not that come from 10% and 15% comps. We are going to have good, but at the levels that we have and assuming there is still going to be better than others. It's still going to require some the margin over time and we look at that, but we are not terribly concerned about how it impacts the given, so organic helps.","The fact of the matter is, is, you know, I think mentioned this as an example, and one of things that again talks about the younger members well. What we found is when we tried fresh organic around beef. I think in the first year, we did $25 million-plus in an item or two.","This is at a higher price point and a greater savings and a fair margin for us, a better margin for us relative to a more competitive. The cool thing was is that 80% of those sales were existing members that have not bought beef with us before. They love Costco, but they are organic.","On average, I would say they tend to be a little younger. That is my guess and so those are the kind of things that I think are going to help us little too. The fact that increasing penetration of our company is overseas over time.","Notwithstanding the week exchanged rates this quarter we generally tend to have a little higher margin overseas where you even in the U.S, where you do not have a direct competitor in the market a mile away or less, you are going to have a little better margin, so all those things I think should impact us positively, but we are not going to change what we do in terms of occasionally identifying those key items that we are just not going to budge on.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. Thank you for that. One final question, which is kind of related, but we obviously saw softness in some hardline categories, electronics has been bad for awhile, do you think at all you have to re-think how the products that you are offering because of that. Is there something else that you would be more aggressive on, would you take space away? How are you thinking about longer-term?","Richard Galanti","Well, as you know electronics reach you when you walk into a Costco. Certainly, the online is part of that. We do a strong business online. Part of the business is not only bigger ticket, but bulkier is about both the items. We have a white club alternative installation as well and so that business is growing, but getting people in the door in Costco, we still have a lot of TVs as well that way.","Again, you have a few unusual things happening right now. Cameras, I understand, cameras are down 30-plus percent in the industry. We are not that different. In fact, we have got a lot. That was a very successful and there is still a big volume business, but that has been weak year-over-year in a bigger way for the first time.","Desktops and laptops, we started to get some traction on tablets of late, but I think that is a business and we - I do not think just say re-thinking allocation of space if anything is still a strong area for us, but we got hammered a little bit over that Christmas selling season.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Again a lot of it was TVs or some of those other items.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, Richard.","Richard Galanti","Hi.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Two follow-up questions. The first, just on the gas deflation that you are now starting to see. Can you remind us, historically does it impact your traffic trends as gas, in general, if it does get very deflationary and come down a lot, do you have to find other ways to keep drive that traffic comp?","Richard Galanti","Interestingly when prices are coming down, we actually historically, saved the member a little more because we turn it so fast and so we are buying every day, if you will. The guys out on the street is buying it every six or eight days or nine days. And so, when it going up, it is costing us a little more and we are competitive. We are still the lowest price hopefully, but there is a less savings. There is a little less news about it out there and so I think overall, on a macro basis, when prices are just coming down, even though we are saving the customer a little more, it is less newsworthy, the fact that it is not on the nightly news. And so there is probably a little less positive there. But given how big we are in that business now, it's not as impactful either way.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got you, and just a different question. Can you remind us with your international business, how you are thinking about new markets? I think France, you have mentioned before. Any update on timing? Or when you could open a new country?","Richard Galanti","Well, Spain is April or May. May. And France is hopefully about a year ahead. And beyond that, we haven't disclosed anything. In terms of how, there is generally the three likely areas and no order as other parts of Europe, South America and China. And we haven't really stated beyond France and Spain, what our plans are beyond that. Nor do we plan to discuss that right now.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks very much, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot. This is Steve Tanal, on for Matt Fassler. Just a quick one on gross margins. It sounds like much of the year-on-year decrease was sort of intentional or through price investments, if you will. And we are just wondering do we think about that going forward? In the next few quarters, at a minimum, do you think the trends likely to stay this way? Or how are you guys thinking about that near-term?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, let me correct this. With all the different numbers running around here, in terms of Q2, fresh was intentional. The rest of it was not intentional. Some of its promotional, some of it is what we do to have clean inventories, took some extra seasonal markdowns in some areas, including a little bit in electronics. So, some of it was that.","In terms of the plans going forward, again, I have eluded to the fact that we are starting to see a little better costing on the poultry side. Meat continues to be competitive and rising. Then beyond that, I can't tell you a lot. But again, meat and produce, fresh foods was our proactive aggressiveness. The rest of it is doing what we do and responding to competition and responding to weak sales being a little weaker and getting rid of stuff.","Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs","Understood. That's very helpful, actually. Just on membership fees, we seem to underestimate the impact of FX there, but it also does seem like enough. I think that affects the overall comp. You guys talked about sort of two percentage point drag. It looks like it was more like three on member fees. Is there anything you could help us as we think about the split there international versus U.S. and how to get that right going forward?","Richard Galanti","The biggest impact FX wise was in Canada, which is 10%, 12% of our company. I think a higher, a strong penetration of Executive memberships which is the higher fee. So those things probably pushed it a little bit. In terms of guessing in the future, your guess is as good as mine.","Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Then just to confirm that there were no buybacks in the second quarter. Correctly? And you guys are planning to buy back in the third quarter.","Richard Galanti","Correct.","Steve Tanal - Goldman Sachs","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Good morning, Richard. I just got two questions for you. The first one is, can you comment a little bit? Canada was strong for you fundamentally. Can you just talk a little bit about the market, what's going on there? What's Costco's positioning and the second question is, can you give us an update on the private label initiative in Kirkland Signature and sort of parse, new categories that you guys are excited about looking forward?","Richard Galanti","Canada is strong. Canada, frankly is not only where we (Inaudible), which is a positive. Historically, in the last several years was good about it. It has a good economy. It didn't have the financial crisis issues that U.S. had. It's got a of course part of its economy is natural resource base, which has been on fire, so those are all positive things.","It has lower healthcare expenses as a percent of sales. It's just by the nature of the healthcare out there versus here, so all those things have been positive for us. Again, though we have got a 98% decline year-over-year in currency that washes that away in terms of how we reported for the (Inaudible).","In terms of private label, I think some of the areas, apparel was good one that can be used I think to be exciting as talked [technology] about in last year about the a little [slack]. We have got a great [slack] now that's I think 1999, I know we had some additional items and so we are doing that that will be an area I think that will continue to grow for us.","On the food side organic, where we are doing a few more items, which in a lot of places it will continue to grow. I think what probably over time, we have not appreciated is strength of it not only the U.S. or Canada for these items being able to take it to other countries, where we take a regular branded private international item to that country. We showed incredible savings, where prices have always been high. These items given the quality level and the pricing if that strengthens is I think exacerbated even more that is the positive.","Bob Drbul - Nomura","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Richard, most my question has been asked. Just a quick one on February, you made the decision to call out whether any impact there. What was the weather materially different than what you saw in January and mean you kind of said there were some stuff that happened in. What kind of kept it, because in the U.S. it just shows like kind of January, February were basically pretty similar.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","You probably live in that area. Now it is more severe in February. As an example on just the last week of February, the Southwest handled with rain for five days. Japan was to the company, which is another you insult to injury, if you will. I mean, I think we had what, 80 units in Japan? I do not have exactly telephone, so half a dozen or fixed rate of that were impacted in the Tokyo market. Yes, so again, that was just a little bit more, but overall, yes, it was more expensive than we have seen before.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","That's good color. Thanks. Then just on the club openings reflect you got to kind of get to that 30 kind of gross number this year that you guys are open for. What about as we look to next year? You are still confident you can get that number North of 30?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Yes, I mean the Craig's had just drop of goal Craig and Jeff Brotman's goal are to get that at lower 30-plus range. I am sure, now that I have said it, we will get 28 or 29 but at the end of the day, they are shooting for 30 to 35 years for the next five years.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Hi. Thanks. First on electronics and then on the membership. You mentioned it was up then you listed some categories like cameras. That is overall down. Was it just TVs that drove CE, and was that ASP or volume?","Richard Galanti","Excuse me. What?","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Tablets?","Richard Galanti","Tablets were part of it. Also the quarter overall was different in February. February was a little weaker in electronics.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","So if we look at the --","Richard Galanti","The biggest chunk is TVs just by volume. And so that is partly why February, TVs were weaker in February, relatively speaking, than they were for the quarter. And they were actually about flat. I think the average sale price is about flat. It had been up -- it's up. Bob is saying it's up. Hold on, I have to tell you.","In the second quarter, the average price point looks like it was up a 2%, and that's probably because we are selling bigger ticket, bigger with TVs.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Is that inflation --","Richard Galanti","No. By the way, one of the comments, that I heard at the budget meeting last week was that, the rollout of the next generation of technology in TVs has been a little bit delayed and it's going to be in a few months ago. April instead of January. I am being coached here. Again, that should help it a little bit but we will see.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay, great. Well, I don't think you need any coaching for the next question. On memberships, so I want to make sure I am getting this right. We finally have a quarter that's (inaudible) in terms of the fee increase.","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","So if we are up 7%?","Richard Galanti","In local currency.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Is it fair to say, that in the U.S., while membership renewals are great and you have that the mix towards Executive, that memberships per club in the U.S. is actually trending down a little bit. If that's the case, has that shifted at all?","Richard Galanti","I don't have that detail here. I have to look. To the extent that we have opened 14 or so U.S. warehouses and maybe a little bit, but actually, I don't know if I am correct on that. I have to look.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay, we can follow-up on it. But conceptually its still the mix shift going on to Executive?","Richard Galanti","Yes, by the way, one of things is, I will give you an example, we opened just couple or three years ago, in Huntington Beach, California, LA. We have 50% plus of the households or more in the Greater LA market at that 40 or so locations. We may open up in a new market there with the eight to 15 weeks prior to opening the sign-ups tabling activities.","As of opening day, we might have 5,000 or less new members. In the mean time, that's a unit that may very well, well exceed our company average for the first year, do $150 million, $100 million of which is new and $50 million which is cannibalized. So you have got numbers that are closer, they are going to shop more frequently for the first time.","Contrast that, in Asia where again during those eight to 15 weeks prior to opening, as of opening day, we see numbers in the 25,000 to 50,000 new member signups with a bigger non-renewal. A lower renewal rate the year hence but nonetheless that should be a big difference.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay. That's helpful.","Richard Galanti","So my guess is, that yes, it could be flat or down slightly, but that could be expected in that example.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Given the cannibalization. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch from Raymond James.","Budd, your line is open.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","My questions have all been asked. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hi, guys. I will be quick. It's at the end of the call. Just wanted to follow-up on the inflation question and produce inflation, deflation and whatnot with the potential of some inflation working in to produce, you guys investing in price there. How is that going to work through, as we assume next, say a quarter or two, if we do get some spikes in produce inflation? How does that work through your numbers?","Richard Galanti","My guess, it would help a little unlike. As an example, meat is so much more that's out there. Produce, everybody has got different items, different pack sizes, different qualities and we can still show great savings but it is just not, in my view it is just not the same type of level as competition.","So I don't think that that's going to impact us as more. That will impact us as much. The biggest thing in produce is, is when there is a drought or a freeze and we are doing hundreds of millions of dollars of items, be it strawberries or blueberries. In a given month, you know you did $5 million an items, instead of 15 during the holiday item that was [freeze] that is more impactful than competition's.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Then just one last one (Inaudible) if you don't want to, let's talk offline, but as you guys expand internationally because much more focused the growth and we have seen other retailers try this has worked well. It's working well for you guys, but just talk about the structure a little bit you are putting in place to make sure that kind of momentum up overseas. Thanks.","Richard Galanti","First and foremost, we start any country with existing employees that are from our company. The woman running Spain is a seasoned, operations person executive from Canada for many, many years.","The guy running Taiwan goes back to the price club days in Southern California. The guy running Korea started as a warehouse manager at Costco and before that I believe - but when we go over we send a core group of half a dozen people, have three or four people to merchandising operations.","I think the biggest thing to make sure everybody is on the same pages is, these individuals travel to Seattle every four weeks or 13 times a year for a day-and-a-half budget meeting and they are typically here for an extra day and doing other operations in merchandising-specific meetings.","Then like Jim for many years, Craig and others are traveling to those countries or often Craig out of the country today. The biggest way we do I think is everybody beginning on the same page. The other thing is, I will give you a good example. When asked for why have we been so successful in several countries including some of these countries in Asia, we think part of it is, is not only is our value proposition more extreme over there, and also that people actually do like big American stuff.","The fact is, is that some of these private label items that we are developing now have been huge successes in some of these of other countries and those U.S. sourced goods, so I think all those things play well into our hand, but that's going to change over time, so we do what we do best is we are constantly focused on it.","These heads of countries and [purchaser] countries come to Seattle at least four weeks know one of things that each of the senior VPs of operations in every country has one, Canada has two and U.S. has eight, but all those foreign ones, they come here and one of the things that they report on is what initiatives in terms of global sourcing procuring goods from a multinational manufacturer where the U.S. buys a heck of a lot from, perhaps Canada does, because we are big and they are now longtime, but because of whatever it is a licensing arrangement or regional pressure on their side. It is a work in progress that were making good success there. All those things, they are little things, but they help us every day, so I think that will continue.","It is really a lot of that blocking and tackling and we had, just like we did when we went to Alaska for the first time and to Hawaii for the first time, we feel that we have really lower prices in those markets and they were more competitive, but we still shine better competitively versus other retail formats.","Given the fact that in some of these countries pricing has been a lot higher. I think that has helped us. Bringing goods, whether it is in the Jumbo Cashews or the fresh blueberries to countries where they are buying a lot more of it.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Perfect. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","I am going to take just two more questions.","Operator","Okay. Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag & Caldwell.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell","Hi, Richard. I just wanted to clarify. Maybe you said this and I missed it, but when you talked about the 30 basis points to 50 basis points of gross margin impact, how much of that would have been sort of those response to price cuts versus proactive?","Richard Galanti","Well, I guess there's three things to talk about. I can't tell you exactly. I know in and fresh foods it's just wanting to keep the price where it is on key items and doing what we do. If you think about, let's say, card lines, let's say whether it's electronics or whatever. Again, if sales are a little soft, we are proactive to mark things down to get rid of them before the season ends. Structurally, we have the benefit, I think, of being in and out of seasons early, but that doesn't mean we still don't have to take some excess markdowns some times.","In terms of responsive, I would say proactive is more impactful than responsive, the issue of being responsive, but there is some responsive too out there.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell","Do you see any changes in the competitive landscape and where is it coming from?","Richard Galanti","No, we really haven't. There is still a lot of tough competition out there. We wish that part of the challenge with the Internet and delivery, there is delivery included and what extra things, I think we are getting a little better of communicating what's the value in our product, in terms of an extra controller or whatever it is or the shipping because when we do price shops, the least competitive ones are some of those that are on the Internet. Now I don't need to name names.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell","Yes. Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman from Telsey.","Joe Feldman - Telsey","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry for prolonging this call, but just wanted to ask you, competitively I have seen a lot from, you are the big major club competitor out there lately in terms of, you are testing some stuff with online membership or your being little more aggressive in different countries. And I am just wondering if you guys are seeing any impact to that or any pressure or just how you are dealing with competitive issues?","Richard Galanti","Well, in terms of direct club competition, no. I believe Sam's did a fee increase that they tested originally in Texas and rolled that out now in the U.S. They are only, by the way, in the U.S. and in Mexico. But we have that seen any, Sam's is very competitive, but we haven't seen any giant changes in that or us needing to respond to something that they have done.","Joe Feldman - Telsey","Got it. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions. I will turn it back over to management for closing remarks.","Richard Galanti","Well, thank you, everyone, and for the chatting in 12 weeks. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference call.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Richard Galanti. Please go ahead.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Amanda and good afternoon to everyone.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.

For the quarter, earnings came in at $1.77 a share, up 2% or $0.04 over last year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of $1.73 a share. In comparing the year-over-year fourth quarter earnings results a couple of items of note in looking at the comparison. FX as compared to a year ago during the fourth quarter, foreign currencies in the countries and other areas where we operate were weaker overall versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Mexico, Canada, UK and Korea, this resulting in foreign \u2013 in our foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $13 million after tax or $0.03 a share and exchange rates been flat year-over-year.","Gasoline profitability. Our profits from gasoline during the quarter as compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter were lower by about $27 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share, primarily a function of last year\u2019s very strong profit results in the fourth quarter. Our numbers were fine this quarter, but we did pretty well last year as well. IT modernization, that was about a $0.02 year-over-year impact. I can go for the detail on that, but that was about $60 million pre-tax or 4 basis points to the \u2013 primarily to the SG&A line.","Income taxes. Both this year and last year\u2019s fourth quarter results had several positive \u2013 net positive tax benefits that in the aggregate benefited each of the fourth quarter\u2019s earnings per share figures by $0.05. Excluding those positive tax items, this year\u2019s underlying Q4 tax rate was about 0.06% of a percentage point higher than last year\u2019s. That would have been about $0.02 a share, but again, year-over-year in the quarter, each of those fiscal quarters benefited by about $0.05 a share from positive items.","LIFO, this year in the fourth quarter, we reported pre-tax LIFO credit of $31 million. That compares to last year in the fourth quarter of $14 million, so both deflationary, although we have all talked about the increased levels of deflation of recent time. So at year-over-year delta $17 million or about $0.02 a share related to a higher deflation in the LIFO credit in the quarter up by \u2013 higher by that amount.","In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total reported sales were up 2%. Our 16-week reported comparable sales figures were flat year-over-year. Comparable sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation. That was a little over 200 basis points of impact to the company and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, the latter about 1 percentage point of impact to sales. Excluding deflation, the flat U.S. comp sales figure for the fourth quarter would have been plus 2%. The reported Canadian comp figure of plus 2% would have been plus 5% ex-gas and FX and the reported minus 2% other international comp figure, ex these two factors, would have been plus 1%. Total comps were reported as zero for the quarter and again, excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 3%. And of course, the plus 3% adjusted figure is still being impacted by a bit of an increased general merchandise deflation outside of gasoline.","Openings in Q4, we opened 10 new locations and also completed 1 relo. And for the fiscal year, we opened 29 net new locations. On top of that of 4 relocations I believe 2 of them which were relocated in the old units converted into new business centers. Of the 29 locations, 21 were in the U.S., 2 are in Canada, 2 are in Japan, and 1 each were in UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.","This afternoon, I will also review with you our membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margin and SG&A, talk about e-commerce and a few other items of note, including an update on our recent switch over to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. This occurred on June 20 after 6 weeks into the fourth quarter.","So, on to the fourth quarter results. Quickly, sales for the fourth quarter were $35.7 billion, up 2% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter sales of $35 billion, again, a flat comp on a reported basis plus 3% excluding gas deflation and FX. The flat comp sales results on a reported basis that consisted of an average transaction decrease of 2.8%. Again, excluding gas and FX deflation \u2013 gas deflation and FX, the average transaction was slightly positive year-over-year and an average shopping frequency increase of right around 2.5%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geography, Texas, Bay Area and the Midwest regions within the United States showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, Spain and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, sales for that within food and sundries, overall slightly negative year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","Within that though, spirits, sundries and deli came in best. Tobacco was the big negative, of course, as we have talked about that and that was down 21% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. If I look at the food and sundries category, that again on a comp basis was slightly negative year-over-year for the quarter. Ex the tobacco department, it was plus 3. And you can see \u2013 continue to see tobacco impacting us into the early spring.","Hardlines, overall up mid single-digit. The departments with the strong results were majors, electronics, sporting goods, health and beauty aids, hardware and tires. Within softlines, which was up in the low single-digits, apparel, small electrics and home furnishings were the standouts. Within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest of the four departments. Of course, meat has had a lot \u2013 meat and other types of protein had a weakness relative to deflation. In ancillary businesses, hearing aids, pharmacy and optical showed the best results. I had mentioned earlier we have recently seen a little pickup in the level of deflation overall. Some categories in the low to mid single-digits \u2013 in the low to mid single-digit range and several fresh food categories, notably meat and pork and things like that in the 5% to 10% range in some cases. Overall though, we are seeing net increasing deflation, but not in those levels and some non-food levels as well \u2013 non-foods as well.","Moving to the line items on the income statement, membership fees, we saw good results for the quarter. Reported were $832 million, up 9 basis points and $47 million or up 6% in dollars versus last year\u2019s fourth quarter. It would \u2013 the $47 million would have been up $50 million if you would adjust it for FX. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide, continuing increasing penetration of executive memberships as well. In terms of number of members at fourth quarter and year end, at year end, we had 36.8 million Gold Star members, up from 36.2 million 16 weeks earlier at the end of the third quarter. Primary Business ticked up to 7.3 million from 7.2 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million for a total of 47.6 million member households at Q4 end compared to 16 weeks earlier when it was 46.9 million and including add-on cards in terms of you walking around with a Costco membership card in their wallet, 86.7 million at year end, up from 85.5 million just 16 weeks earlier.","In terms of Executive Member sign-ups \u2013 Executive Members, we have of the 47.6 million member households, we have 17.4 million. That was an increase of 370,000 during the 16-week fourth quarter or about 23,000 a week increase. And that\u2019s a combination, of course, of new members signing up as an Executive Member as well as members converting to it. Executive Members now account for a little over a third of our base and a little more than two-thirds of our sales, where Executive Members are offered.","In terms of membership renewal rates, we ended the year at 90.3% in the U.S. and Canada. That\u2019s ticked down from 90.4% at the end of Q3. In the first half, it was 90.5%; worldwide, 87.6%, which was the same at Q3 end, ticking down from 87.7% in the previous quarter, again, the second quarter. As I have talked about in the last few quarters, in Canada, we finally, in Q4, saw a reversal of some reductions in renewal rates, which we had anticipated when we converted 1.5 year or so ago to a new program card up there. In that case, the portfolio from American Express wasn\u2019t purchased. So it was really had to start all over and you don\u2019t have as many auto renewals to start with. But that\u2019s quickly changed and we have \u2013 again in Q4, we saw a slight increase in the renewal rate there. A little different reason but the same thing a little bit in the U.S. with having no new sign-ups for the last nine months prior to June 20 as we were switching over on June 20. So overall, pretty much the same and we will see where that goes from here.","Regarding membership fees, effective the beginning of this month, we increased membership fee \u2013 annual membership fees by about 10% in three Asia locations Taiwan, Korea and Japan, as well as in Mexico and the UK. On an annual basis and as you know, fee increases hit the membership fee income line over about 23 months based on deferred accounting. For example, the first month, people that are seeing this in September, those are people that originally signed up presumably in September and this is when they renew. People that don\u2019t \u2013 didn\u2019t sign up or aren\u2019t renewing until next March, they will be in March and for 12 months end. So that ends the 23 months overall. That will be about $50 million pretax to the membership income line. I am sure there will be some offset in terms of what we do in terms of competitive pricing and everything.","Before continuing down the income statement line items, let me spend a minute updating you on our transition from American Express to Citi Visa in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. As I mentioned this took place on June 20, the beginning of the seventh week into the fiscal fourth quarter. Beginning June 20, we stopped accepting American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and on costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card. There was a lot of effort and as you know, there were a few operations glitches during the first few weeks after the cutover. We are now past that and more importantly, the new card is fantastic for our members. In terms of increased cash back rewards, the estimate is about a 40% to 50% improvement in the reward program, which is already previously a very good reward program to the members using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. And it\u2019s also great for us in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years and of course lowering our effective costs of accepting credit and debit cards.","In terms of improved cash back member rewards, our former card provided a 3% cash back on gas, 2% on restaurant and travel, and 1% everywhere else, including everywhere at Costco other than the gas. With the new CV\u2019s Anywhere card 3% on gas now is 4%, 2% on restaurant and travel is now at 3% and probably the most significant rewards improvement in terms of the total bucket here is the previous 1% reward on all other Costco purchases doubled from the previous 1% cash back rewards now to 2%. We think this is big and it\u2019s even bigger for our executive members who also are in the 2% reward from us on most Costco purchases. So combined, an executive member using the new card with just a few exceptions will earn 4% back at Costco. We think this is exciting, and we think it will be good for our business over the next several years. Now lastly for all other purchases outside of Costco on the card, it will be \u2013 it will remain at 1% cash back reward.","A few basic stats on the new card, approximately 11.4 million American Express co-branded cards, representing about just under 7.5 million accounts were transferred over to Citi during the conversion. Nearly 85% of those cards what we considered active, that is the card had been used for purchases over the previous 60 days. Currently, over 85% of the accounts transferred over have now been activated with Costco. And since June 20 and just the past many weeks, 1.1 million members have applied for the new card and over 730,000 new accounts have been activated or a little over 1 million additional Citi Visa cards in circulation. It\u2019s still early. We launched only 14 weeks ago, but so far, we are beating our initial expectations in terms of conversion, usage and new sign-ups to the card. In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin was higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 28 basis points from \u2013 up from 11.14% a year ago to 11.42%. Let you jot down the normal numbers that I asked you to jot down. With our [ph] four columns, reported and without gas deflation Q3 \u201816 \u2013 in Q3 \u201816 would be the first two columns. The third and fourth columns would both be Q4 \u201816 but then also reported without gas depreciation.","The core merchandise in Q3 on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 16 basis points, but without gas deflation, down 2 basis points year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, up 29 basis points of this \u201816 and again ex gas deflation, up 9 basis points. Ancillary businesses in Q3, plus 9 and plus 4 reported in the gas deflation. And in Q4 \u201816, ancillary businesses reported minus 4 and minus 9 without gas deflation. 2% reward, zero and a plus 2 in Q3 and a minus 2 and a zero in Q4. LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and in Q4 \u201816, plus 4 and \u2013 I am sorry, plus 5 and plus 4. Other, in Q3 \u201816, both columns had a plus 7 and Q4, no issue, a zero and zero. So, all told in reporting on a year-over-year basis in Q3 of \u201816 compared to the prior Q3, up 34 basis points on a reported basis and up 13 on ex-gas deflation basis. This year in the fourth quarter of course, you saw the 28 basis point up, that would have been plus 4 ex-gas deflation. I might add that the plus 7 a year ago, that was \u2013 I am sorry in Q3 that was simply a one-time legal settlement that benefited margin [ph].","As you can see overall, again our margin was higher by 28, but without gas, plus 4. The core merchandise component that you see \u2013 that I have just mentioned, the plus 29 or the plus 9 ex-gas deflation, that\u2019s the thing our folks want to start with. Our core gross margins, which is fresh foods \u2013 food, sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the quarter by 12 basis points with food and sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins slightly, softlines being about flat year-over-year and fresh foods being ever so slightly down year-over-year. Ancillary and other business gross margins were down 4 basis points, ex-gas deflation, down 9, all a function of lower year-over-year gas prices \u2013 gas profits. And as discussed earlier in the call \u2013 but excluding gas, all other ancillary and other businesses gross margins as a percent of their own sales were up 6 basis points. So margins were fine in the quarter overall. And again, LIFO added 4 basis points to the equation.","In terms of SG&A expenses, for the quarter year-over-year, we were up 34 basis points, coming in at 10.34 versus a 10.00 a year ago. And again that 34 \u2013 I will have you jot down a couple of numbers, that 34 ex-gas deflation is a minus 13 or higher by 13, not higher by 84. Again the same four columns, Q3 \u201816 for reported and Q3 \u201816 for without gas and the same two column headings for Q4 \u201816 \u2013 in Q4 \u201816. Operation, core operations, minus 24 basis points and a minus means higher, higher by 28 and 4 basis points in Q3 \u201816 on a reported basis, higher by 8 ex-gas deflation. In the fourth quarter, higher by 24 and higher by 6, central, higher by 6 and higher by 4 in Q3 and then Q4, higher by 9 and higher by 7 ex-gas deflation. Stock compensation, higher by 3 and higher by 2 in the third quarter and higher by 1 and flat in the Q4 columns. Then total, reported in Q3 \u201816 compared to Q3 \u201815 on a reported basis, SG&A was higher by 33, but really higher by 14 ex-gas deflation and the higher by 34 this time was higher by 13 so not that different on looking at it that way.","The operations component, the minus 6 core operations ex-gas deflation, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits partly due to the slightly weaker sales and the deflation and particularly in fresh that impacts that number, somewhat offset by a variety of other controls and expense improvements, in particular lower year-over-year bank fees as a result of the Amex Citi Visa switch during the quarter. Central expense was higher year-over-year by 9, 7 ex-gas. Increased IT spending related to modernization that was 4 of those 7 and a couple other basis points higher from a few small legal settlements in the quarter. And again, stock compensation was really not an issue year-over-year.","Next on the income statement pre-opening, pretty much in line with openings themselves. Last year, we had $27 million pre-opening expense. This year, it\u2019s $3 million lower or $24 million. Last year in the quarter, we had 13 openings. This year in the quarter, we had 11 and which includes that relo, pretty much in line again with what we had expected \u2013 would expect. All told, operating income in the fourth quarter came in at $1.191 billion which was $35 million higher or 3% higher year-over-year than last year\u2019s $1.156 billion. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the fourth quarter came in at $39 million this year versus $40 million last year, essentially flat year-over-year, essentially the same amount of debt outstanding at the various interest rates. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter, coming in at $29 million versus $40 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year \u2013 I am sorry, was a little lower year-over-year. The big difference was the other category, which was $16 million, primarily various FX transactions. This year in the fourth quarter, if I added up all the various FX, which is marking to market items and FX from foreign exchange contracts, we made about $11 million pre-tax a year ago. It was a little outsized. We made $26 million. That generally fluctuates. Usually, it\u2019s plus or minus $5 million. Sometimes it\u2019s a little more or less.","Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 2% or $25 million higher, coming in at $1.181 billion. In terms of taxes, I mentioned that earlier, both fiscal fourth quarters this year and last year each benefited by about $0.05 a share from various positive items. And excluding these items, the normalized rate this year was still up about 0.06% from the year earlier. And again, net income coming in at $779 million for the fiscal quarter was up 2% from a year ago.","A quick rundown of some other topics in this afternoon\u2019s release, we have provided you balance sheet information. One thing that is not on the balance sheet that I am always asked about is depreciation and amortization. For the fourth quarter that came in at $408 million and for the entire fiscal year, D&A came in at $1.255 billion. One thing that I will look perhaps a little out on the balance sheet was cash levels and accounts payable and the like. That has to do with modernization and switching our basic accounting platform over and this has been a 2 plus year effort. It was installed and it\u2019s really the platform that allowed the legacy systems will now sit on as we continue to develop them over the next couple of years. Not only was a big effort, it was an expensive effort. But nonetheless, to make sure that we had an extra week at the beginning since this system went in on day 1, we \u2013 anything that was set up in the system, any merchandise or other payables that were set up in our system would be paid in \u2013 during week 1 of the new fiscal year. We prepaid a week early the prior \u2013 up to a week early the prior Friday I believe. And so we paid about $1.7 billion extra in week 52 of this past fiscal year and that\u2019s why you see \u2013 you will see the cash levels down and the payables levels down associated with that.","So again, one of the statistics we always share with you is accounts payable as a percent of inventory. Last year, fourth quarter end on a reported basis was 101%. What you will see now it\u2019s 85%, but again, taking out that $1.7 billion, it\u2019s 104%, actually a slight improvement in our payables ratio. And excluding construction payables and other types of non-merchandise payables, last year was an 89%, again on \u2013 what I will call a normalized basis. Assuming we hadn\u2019t prepaid $1.7 billion of payables, the 89% would have been up a couple of percentage points to 91%, so manage \u2013 seem to be managing that okay.","In terms of average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, it stood at exactly $13 million per warehouse. This year, it came in at just slightly over $12.5 million or about $460,000 lower or 3% lower. And really lower warehouse inventory is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact of deflation in many of the food and fresh departments as well as electronics. A little bit of it has to do with FX, but most of it is just coming down a little bit on inventory levels.","In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we spent approximately $850 million. And for all of fiscal \u201816, we came in right at $2.6 billion. That $2.6 billion by the way compares to $2.4 billion for the prior year fiscal year in \u201815. Our estimate for fiscal \u201817 CapEx is in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, so about the same level as compared to last year perhaps a little bit higher depends on timing. Next, Costco in line, we are currently in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico and recently \u2013 more recently launched in three in Taiwan. For the fourth quarter, sales and profits were up year-over-year. Total sales were up 12% in the quarter, 13% ex-FX. And for all of \u201816, 15% reported plus 17% ex-FX. On a comp basis, for the quarter, we were up 10% reported and 11% FX \u2013 11% excluding FX and for the year are 14% and 17%.","Next discussion in terms of expansion, as I mentioned, in terms of net new locations this year, we opened 29, that\u2019s up from 23 openings in all of \u201815. This current year we have got in our budget 31 net openings, 34, but 3 of them are relos and so something certainly in the high 20s, but I think something our current best guess is the 31. If you look back over the last couple of years, the 23 we opened in \u201815 that represented about 3.5% square footage growth. In fiscal \u201816, the 29 units, recognizing they tend to be a little bigger and we have also expand a few units, it\u2019s about 4.5% square footage growth. And in \u201817, as soon as we got to 31, that would be in the low to mid-4s as well in terms of percentage of square footage growth.","Our planned fiscal \u201817 locations assuming the 31 number would be 17 in the U.S., 7 in Canada and 1 each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia, Mexico, France, our first in France and also a unit in Iceland. And both France and Iceland are currently targeted for mid-to-late spring \u2013 late spring this calendar \u201817. And as we know sometimes they may slip, but that\u2019s our best guess at this point. Note again, these are first locations in France and Iceland and we look forward to seeing some of you over there. As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 103.2 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases for the fourth quarter, we purchased $131 million worth of stock or 856,000 shares at an average price just over $153 a share. For all of fiscal \u201816, we purchased $477 million of stock. That compares to $493 million in 2015 and $333 million in 2014.","In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share. We increased that this past spring a few months ago. That was 12.5% increase from the prior quarterly and annual rate. So, this year at $0.45 a quarter, this yearly $1.80 a share dividend represents an annual cost to the company of just under $800 million. Next Wednesday, October 5, at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, we will announce our September sales results for the 5-week period ending Sunday, October 2, this coming Sunday. This 5-week period will include 34 selling days in the U.S. and Canada recognizing the closing of your business in the observance of Labor Day in those two countries. Lastly, our fiscal \u201817 first quarter results, for the 12 weeks ending November 20, we will do it as we have done this time, we will report after shortly after the market close on Wednesday, December 7 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2:00.","With that, Amanda, I will turn it back to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","My pleasure. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from John Heinbockel.","John Heinbockel","Richard, so let me start with expansion. I think you said 7% in Canada, was that right?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","John Heinbockel","So, kind of \u2013 which I don\u2019t none in recent years have you opened that many in Canada, so what sort of drove that some unique real estate opportunities? Does cannibalization pick up over the next year in Canada? And then sort of tying it back to the U.S., when you think about where you sit today, have you really done any deeper thinking about what the saturation level in the U.S. could be beyond where we sit today?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, in Canada, I think it\u2019s a couple of reasons. If you think back 5 or so years ago or even 10 years ago when we had probably 65, 70 units, we thought the market might be 91 day and today we have 90 or 91 and we think that they will certainly be over 100 and we keep adding a few to that concept. I think the fact that we are opening so many right now has to do with as much with very strong sales over the last few years. We have been enjoying 5% to 9% comps in local currency in each of the last few years up there and so it keeps getting stronger. And just like in the U.S. and even in mature markets, we find that we can \u2013 while there will be some cannibalization, the net business that\u2019s added when we opened a unit even though it\u2019s cannibalizing, net of cannibalization will find that existing members will then be shopping more frequently, because they are closer. And so I think it\u2019s a combination of those things. And I don\u2019t know what the new 5 or 10-year guesstimate is in Canada. I don\u2019t think we can open 7 a year, but once we decided to go to look and see where we are going and how strong we have been, we have been \u2013 this is the result of probably an effort that started over a year ago to put a few more in the pipeline up there.","In terms of the U.S., I think the same story holds true If you had ask us 5 years or so years ago, by now how many would be in the U.S. versus outside the U.S. and we would have said probably we would be down from 75% or 80% in the U.S. to 50% and heading south of there is we saturate. We found in the U.S. that we can put more units in existing markets. I think we are getting, in a couple of months, we are getting ready to open our 17th or so unit in the Puget Sound, having opened our 16 or unit just less than a year ago. And the other thing of course, in the U.S. that we have perhaps up to our expectation is markets that 5 years or so years ago we didn\u2019t think we would have any near-term interest in considering medium sized markets where our direct competition was there. And what we have found is we have done pretty well when we go to these markets. Now some of these markets are smaller, it takes a little longer, but there is clearly an opportunity for us there and as we have gone into Tulsa and New Orleans and Birmingham and Rochester and lots of \u2013 and Toledo, these are markets that again, were higher on the radar 7 years or 8 years ago. And what we have seen is that our deal works. The last thing of course, includes adding to some of the business centers. For many years we only had six or eight or so business centers. We opened four last year to be at 11 and we are planning to open four this year to be at 15 including our first business center in Canada. And so again, that just adds a few in both the Canada question and the U.S. question. It includes that opportunity on a small basis. And a side on that is, I think as I have mentioned, I think two of the four relos this year were \u2013 two of the four business center openings this year were relos. One in back in many of your [indiscernible] when we took an older, smaller parking lot, no gas station, Hackensack Costco and relocated it to Teterboro nearby with the big sized unit with lots of great parking, great ingress in the U.S. and a gas station and converted the Hackensack unit into the business center, so just a small additional benefit in terms of having a use for units as we moved some of those to bigger locations. So all that\u2019s I think been part of it.","John Heinbockel","Alright. And then just lastly, have you sort of finalized or thought about the percentage of the Amex to Visa benefit that you are going to get, how much you keep versus providing that back to members, when you think about putting it back to members, when you think about price, labor and\/or service and then maybe product development, where is the most lucrative place to reinvest and I am not \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it would be price, but is it something like product development and pushing the envelope outlook more in Kirkland?","Richard Galanti","Well, some of those things that you threw out is possible ways to use that parts of this bucket of money. We do all of those anyway. And I think probably the best, simplest answer is that just like when we buy a physical product better lower we can buy whether it\u2019s lower freight, greater purchasing power or greater production efficiencies or whatever we figure out with our supplier, we generally wanted 80% or 90% of that, the vast majority of it given back to the customer in terms of lower price because that\u2019s what drives us and drives our business. And if we do it more next year, we will give 80% or 90% of that back. It\u2019s not an exact number, but it\u2019s well closer to 80% or 90%. That same MO and philosophy occurred here. So when we sat down and negotiated all the various levers that relate what I call this bucket of money, there is a lot of ways one can use it, most importantly by improving the reward on the cards to the member that\u2019s going to utilize it. That will drive value to that member and loyalty to us and also more business to us. And secondly, what\u2019s left over and when we originally did it, we did it such that we are going to keep a small amount of it. Now, to the extent \u2013 we are not going to change the rewards program every afternoon if we see that there is more money in the bucket. So that will additionally accrue to us, but it\u2019s not changing what you are doing with it. We are going to still do those other things. So again I think over time, you look at it and you can rest assured in a few years if the success of the card and the economics of the card to us, we are not going to allow ourselves to keep a lot of that extra, but we started with a small amount and the big bucket is good and it is a little better because the card is working in direction that we expected, that\u2019s good. And we are still going to do those other things anyway.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Simeon Gutman. Morgan Stanley","Simeon Gutman","Thanks guys. Simeon Gutman. Richard, thinking about the top line, we are on the verge of cycling, I would say some of the worst of food deflation, I know you mentioned it\u2019s picking up a little and then some of the traffic that the business got on the gas side and I think the tobacco headwinds you mentioned is still a little more to go and first, is that fair that we are on the verge of cycling that. And then if we are, should we expect to pickup in the business from a top line, are expecting a pickup, I am just curious how you are thinking about that?","Richard Galanti","What was the last part of the question, Simeon?","Simeon Gutman","I mean, should we see the business in flat from the top line as some of these, I guess deflation top line headwind debate?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Well I think first of all, I think first of all there is \u2013 first one, when I asked different buyers and different merchandise categories, their view is it\u2019s going to be three months to six more months. Recognizing these are also gasses, I mean they are perhaps educated, unless you know there is something specifically happening like you are anniversary-ing the bird flu or your anniversary-ing really high feed prices on the commodity side. Sometimes there is a little more predictability on that side. But beyond that, I would say probably best guess is five months or six months of continued deflation at these newer levels in some cases. Gas, who the heck knows.","Simeon Gutman","Are there any changes there?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Bob is here. Barring any major changes out there, you would see an inflection point probably in. More neutralism.","Simeon Gutman","Late fall.","Richard Galanti","Late fall, so it\u2019s a few months. That sounds like a definite maybe.","Simeon Gutman","If you \u2013 I guess if you take the deflation in the food categories, if you take some of the deflation, maybe in electronics or do this analysis of looking at the units versus the sales, I guess what is that delta if you put it altogether, like your best guess at that?","Richard Galanti","I have to get back to you on that and I will give you some sound points, if you will. Some of it, I mean there are so many examples particularly like in meat. You have seen every month at the budget meeting where we will have literally a 10 or so percentage point dropped in the price per pound and a 4 or 5 \u2013 3% or 4% or 5% increase in labor productivity per pound and less efficiency because of the fact that the price per pound went down much more than that. And so that\u2019s the kind of stuff that hits your profitability, of course too. There is \u2013 if I look at \u2013 there is some interesting things going on with some commodities. I was just looking at a chart coffee, the average \u2013 these are average sales but it\u2019s consistent with average cost, down 16%. A lot of things, in the certain \u2013 cheeses are down 10% to 20%. I believe eggs are way down right now. And so those things are all impacting you. Now it impacts you on selling eggs, it helps you a little bit in selling muffins because we are obviously changing 6 impact a month and from making the numbers. We sold them for but $5.99 down 5$.89. And so you are going to \u2013 I would say the net of those twos is still a detriment to us. By the way, what I mentioned earlier about late fall, that had to do specifically with gas. We will see the inflection point, it looks like we are going to see an inflection point with gas all things being equal out there in the next couple of months.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then my follow-up is related to the credit card, I guess looking back, you only had a couple of months, but are there signs that there was some deferred spending on either big ticket items. And then if you have the data, is the same member who is either buying on AMEX or not on the co-branded card, is their spending up individually year-over-year, meaning they are incented by the card and they are actually spending more with you?","Richard Galanti","As it relates to the first question, absolutely. We probably saw it biggest and something that the millennials don\u2019t buy, affiliates. We saw a big decline for a few weeks leading up to it and big increase right afterwards. Also, on big ticket, but generally speaking, jokes aside on millennials, across the board we saw improving bigger ticket purchases, which again that make sense, people are waiting. Now there is all types of movement in both directions. You had existing \u2013 a member with existing Visa cards in his or her wallet and maybe they are using that one, not ours, that\u2019s fine. We still have a negotiated good rate on certain things. You have people that were using debit their whole lives because they perhaps did not want an American Express card or they applied for one and did not get one. And so for 16 years, they used cash, check and debit. Now, for the first time, they can use a credit card and I am sure that\u2019s where we saw many of these new signups as well or part of them, but in terms of are they buying more with us? Anecdotally, we are hearing that from our warehouse managers who talk with their biggest wholesale customers, but it\u2019s purely anecdotal at this juncture and I think we will see more of it. I haven\u2019t actually looked any statistics on that.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matt Fassler.","Matt Fassler","Good afternoon, Richard. Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs. Couple of questions. First of all, you spoke in fairly general terms about how you plan to make use of the better economics of the credit card where we hoped to direct it. If you think about the impact on the P&L this quarter along with launch, I don\u2019t know if there are special provisions in place for the cost of launch in the card. I am not sure if there are elements of the change of the arrangement that started to impact it, but would you say that there is any offset to SG&A or meaningful offset to gross margin that resulted from the transition this quarter?","Richard Galanti","Well, certainly there is certain costs were subsidized in the transition from our partners. But at the end of the day, there \u2013 yes, I mentioned I think when I was going through the SG&A, payroll and benefits for our company, were up year-over-year in the quarter in SG&A. And that was somewhat offset by and I said in particular, rounded up into anything related to this credit card transition. So, yes, there is improvement related to that.","Matt Fassler","Got it. And then second question, if you think about other international, obviously you didn\u2019t call out Asia, any of the Asian countries as strong countries, You spoke in over the course of the month it releases about comping some of the big openings that you had in recent years and the other international comp number is a bit lower than we have typically seen anything to think about the franchise in those markets or the macro or how you are resonating in that part of the world?","Richard Galanti","No, it has more I think to do with a little bit of cannibalization in a couple of those countries where you have got 10 or 12 locations in Korea and Taiwan or I think we had a cannibalization in Australia as well, but one location take a $200 million or $300 million building down $70 million, $80 million and that\u2019s what\u2019s in your comp, not the new building. So, that has much to do with it as anything. We feel really good about our markets. We feel very good. And as we have said, the one market that has been \u2013 we start, we remind ourselves that there is a time when we were going to close Korea and Taiwan and they are our most and almost our most profitable productive countries and locations. And we have talked about our first unit in Syria [ph], got off to a slow start. It\u2019s growing nicely now. Madrid got off to a much better start and it\u2019s growing nicely. And so, again, we are patient, but in terms of that other international comp number, I would guess and I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me, but what I have seen before is in recent times is that it\u2019s cannibalization more than anything.","Matt Fassler","And that\u2019s good to hear on Spain by the way. If you think about the cadence of openings and year ago openings and where the new stores are going to open in some of those markets, is this an issue, the cannibalization issue that should stay with you for a little while or is it that to abate at some point over the course of the fiscal year?","Richard Galanti","Which one?","Matt Fassler","The cannibalization primarily in Asia, presumably.","Richard Galanti","I hope it doesn\u2019t abate. That means we are working hard to get more openings there. These are generally no-brainer locations in terms of very predictable successful locations for us. We feel we have developed a great franchise over there with great loyalty and great success and we would like to do it a little more if we can. We are working hard to get more locations in both Korea and Taiwan as an example. And it just takes a long time in Taiwan and longer than a long time in Korea because of zoning and other restrictions and it rains on everybody and other big boxes in those community \u2013 in those areas have the same impact.","Matt Fassler","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Michael Lasser.","Michael Lasser","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. Richard, are you seeing any evidence that you are attracting new members to your club as a result of the more lucrative credit card offer?","Richard Galanti","Yes. And again, this is very early. We have seen in the tens of thousands of signups or people that were members that signed up because of activities in Citi branches and bank branches. And we have seen from the blogs, of course, the first few weeks of the blogs always saw, was about the 30 minute waiting times or longer and other hassles like that. But the reality is we have seen, I would say, it\u2019s still a small percentage, what I mentioned there was 703,000 new accounts, I would guess well less than 100,000, but 50,000 to 100,000, I am guessing, would be that. A lot of it has to do with existing members that we are seeing the value of that card when they walk in.","Michael Lasser","And do you have any plans to try and accelerate the sign-up of new members by raising awareness of the card through marketing effort?","Richard Galanti","We are doing that already. But maybe we are not doing a good enough job. But there is nothing else that we are doing right now and when I say that to our partners as well, because they are doing some things as well, but we are getting the word out in a big way in the warehouse with handouts, with signage, with people, the word is getting out. And we are, again, as I mentioned earlier, we are beating our own expectations of what we had planned for these initial 14 weeks, if you will. And so we feel pretty good about it.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up question is so you are beating your expectations on the credit card overall, you mentioned that spending for maybe some of your larger customers on the card has been a little bit better and may pickup as a result of it. Yet, your overall columns have been a little more sluggish in the last couple of months. Does it actually suggest that you are seeing even though that marginal customer \u2013 that marginal member go away or some other behavioral change that was driving business model?","Richard Galanti","Yes, it\u2019s really hard to tell. I mean, arguably, there is probably 50 different factors that impact sales everyday and every week and every month. And we look at \u2013 try to look at the big picture here. We feel very good about what we are doing in merchandising wise. We feel very good about what we have seen with the crossover to this. Our view has been we don\u2019t think that many people left Costco, because they can\u2019t use their American Express card. American Express is a great brand and it was a great relationship for many years. But at the end of the day, they are coming to Costco because of our quality in our value. And when we look around and as you would well know, we get a lot of questions all the time, well, are we impacted by the Internet, losing some? The internet is taking from everybody. Our view is it takes a little less from us. And interestingly, when you look at the categories within our slightly lower sales over the last couple of few months, the categories that have buffed that trend have been discretionary nonfood categories like apparel and housewares and electronics. So, now when we look at food and sundries, we absolutely do not believe its delivery services. We do absolutely believe its deflation more than anything. But again, everybody takes a little piece of something. It\u2019s a little piece that we would rather have ourselves or not lose. But again, we feel good about what initiatives we have got going on. And again, when I talk about the new card being a reward to the member based on their previous spending habits, 40% to 50% greater reward, that\u2019s big.","When I talk about going from 1% to 2% on Costco purchases when they use that card, that\u2019s big and it\u2019s not big overnight where they just change their habits completely. You will see at first in business members and that\u2019s where we have seen it. Mind you, during the transition, there was probably a little loss of sales for some of those business members in some cases. I am sure American Express didn\u2019t around not doing anything. They are good at what they do and they were able to figure out how to get people, they are marketing elsewhere. But we think that our members at Costco, primarily for us, I think again it\u2019s a lot of different things or different factors and again, having gone to our budget meeting forever but having gone every four weeks, just to name with the last few, some of the initiatives I see going on, merchandising wise, I think we got a lot of good things going on. Not that we are trying to solve a problem from yesterday, it\u2019s what we do everyday.","Michael Lasser","Thanks so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Binder.","Dan Binder","Hi. It\u2019s Dan Binder. Thanks. Just following on here, your comment about the web taking a little bit from everybody, does that change the way you think about your own web strategy, type of items you are willing to put on and delivery times, etcetera just to create greater convenience because price doesn\u2019t really show up on our screen as the major factor?","Richard Galanti","Well first of all, I don\u2019t see us \u2013 yes, we are doing some things anyway and are we doing more things, absolutely. But we are not freaking out about it. We are recognizing \u2013 we recognized that we are not going to be the provider. We may be the provider to somebody that wants to deliver like an Instacart or Google Express, but we are not going to be dropping off small items and our prices at your doorstep. That being said, we are, we have and we continue to add things. On the merchandise initiative side, we have added various sundries items and health and beauty items and on the apparel, trying to get to a more treasure hunt. I think you are going to see big differences literally in the next several weeks of the types of hot items that you see on there on the non-food side in the treasure hunt. On the \u2013 I think that\u2019s probably the biggest thing you will see. Operationally, there is a few things. We are by no means, we are one click. We recognize our site has had some challenges. You are going to see in the next few months a big improvement in the number of clicks. You are going to see in the next six months or eight months, some big improvement on search. You are getting much streamlined returns process. We have never been big on convenience. Our success has been based on pricing value, quality and quantity at the lowest possible price. We do appreciate that value also is convenience. We are going to greatly improve what we do, but it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to get something to you in tow hours. And I think again though, when I look at some of the things that we are doing internally, I am not trying be cute here, but there is something I can\u2019t talk about yet. You will see some differences and mostly the differences are from an offensive standpoint, not a defensive standpoint. But we look at our core business of getting you in the store still is paramount to what we want to do.","Dan Binder","And then if I heard the numbers correctly, it sounds like the growth rate slowed a little bit this quarter on .com, any particular callouts in terms of merchandise that was offered this year, not last year or any particular categories that are slower?","Richard Galanti","I wasn\u2019t going to bring that up only because I don\u2019t want to sound defensive. But there were two things last year in electronics that were big. The iPhone 6 launch last year was huge and the iPhone 7 launch was not as huge. And the other thing is last year was, the introduction of the Windows 10 and there are two things. Prior to a year ago comparison, a few months prior to that, people were waiting for the Windows 10 launch and so you had a lot of pent-up demand and the launch itself and compared to a year later. So those two things alone were part of that. That\u2019s frankly I think one of the bigger things. But again, I think as I have said jokingly, have seriously and have jokingly in the past, some of the things that we haven\u2019t done historically gives us the great opportunity to do these. And there are still some blocking and tackling like couple of things that I just mentioned. We have greatly improved our delivery, but it was from bad to better. It still takes too long and again, we are not going to get something to you in two hours. But you can see some logistically some things. And then on handling returns, particularly big ticket returns, we haven\u2019t done a good job of that and that\u2019s already in process. So you will see some changes that will help. The biggest thing though is going to be the merchandise initiatives. And again I think, you are going to see, we have added items and we are adding some items but we are not trying to figure out what 20,000 additional items because that\u2019s not what we are going to do. But there will be velocity items or repetitive items in the sundries area as well. And you are right, when you look on your radar screen price is not way up there. But I challenge anybody on the call to compare the exact branded items and a big basket of them not just an occasional loss leader or some retailer or .com may have out there, you are going to see yes, it is a lot of savings here, but you will be shocked how much savings. And again, we recognize also we have got to move a little direction and we are doing that.","Dan Binder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Karen Short. Barclays","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess it\u2019s hard to put there my name in general. But I was just curious, on the gas impact, you gave the $0.02 impact, but I was wondering if you could give us some color on how much of that was gas margin versus maybe weaker gallon comps in light of fuel prices being down. And then I am wondering, as price per gallon increases, I am thinking it should obviously help traffic, is that fair, is there anything else to consider in terms of state of the consumer and the competitive landscape? And then I have a follow-up.","Richard Galanti","Well, the gas was $0.04. So last year, we had very strong gas prices, no worries. The year earlier in Q4, we had very strong gas profits. So that\u2019s why a year ago, we didn\u2019t really talk a lot about. This year, we actually beat our own internal budget by a little \u2013 a little from the beginning of the year, but again it was $0.04 lower this year, $0.04 this year than it was in Q4 a year ago. Generally, when prices go down, while it impacts some of these basis point percentage calculations, we make more money. When it goes up, we make a little less money although I would say, for the last couple of years, there has been a new normal. When prices went down, our view is as retail gas, overall, they would lower their prices but not as much as they could have. And we lowered it more than that and we are still able to benefit a little from it. So that was a positive. I think yes, it\u2019s the value proposition more than anything that gets people in our parking lot. And we are helped by the gas buddies out by .coms out there, the 2 years they have done it. And then the 4% rebate. There is a lot of different promotional things at the majors out there whether it\u2019s $0.10 a gallon off, 4% is big. As the price per gallon goes up, 4% gets bigger. And so I think that will be positive for us as well. But if you have been through our gas stations, when you have got, in some cases, 20 pumps now pumping at the same time and the lines move fast but there will be six people in each line. That not only drives the success of the gas business, but 51 or so of those people for every hundred come in and even if one them is incremental, that\u2019s good for us.","Karen Short","And so can you give us some color on what gallon comps were doing this quarter?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know if we do that, but I know that it continues to be higher than the U.S. average. And my guess, I will get back to the answer in a minute, somebody is looking up for me. I believe it\u2019s in the mid-singles. It\u2019s in the mid-singles unless I say otherwise.","Karen Short","Okay. And then just to clarify on your comments on deflation, I know you were talking that deflation ensued and then there was also deflation I guess in fuel, so you had said that fuel prices should start to rebound in late fall, but deflation in food, are you just to clarify five months or six more months in deflation in food is that what you are trying to say?","Richard Galanti","That\u2019s our best guess. Talking to the buyers, that\u2019s our best guess.","Karen Short","And any \u2013 can you call it any categories in particular?","Richard Galanti","Well, the biggest ones would be protein. And you have got some other things, I was looking at my sheets here, hold on a second and this was just year-over-year, this past month. Walnuts were down 47%. That\u2019s our sell price. And I am sorry, that\u2019s our cost. Now a year ago, they had doubled from the prior year. So they were kind of back where they were, almonds down 38%, whole eggs, down 54%, large eggs, down 53%. I am just looking down the sheet of the top 50 items. So those things, particularly things like eggs really add up. On the inflation page, just for fun, nothing. Well I mean, there are some 20s and 30s, but if I look at the top 25 or so items, just in the last four weeks of the fiscal year, regular unleaded gasoline was down 12.8%. And it was over $3.5 million of credit, if you will, to LIFO. We don\u2019t book it every month like that, but that would have been $3 million. So, the biggest items on the deflation sheet add to the LIFO credit of $2 million to $3.5 million, $2 million to $4 million. The biggest items on the inflationary sheet at $300,000 to $500,000 of LIFO charge. So again, it gives you a sense of where it\u2019s going.","Again, another data point is the U.S. inventories at LIFO, that\u2019s an U.S. accounting concept. That was in the indices where you start off for costs on the exact items at the beginning of the fiscal \u201816 at 100.00 and was to go to. Food was down 2.25% with half of that, about 0.5% being just in the last couple of months. Sundries was about down at less than 0.5% and not terribly changed in the last 3 months. Apparel, almost right at the same 100.00 a year ago, almost right there. Computers, I expect down little under 2%. So, it\u2019s all over the board. Again, so you have extreme categories like meat which is high volume, but meat is also, we turn it so much faster. It has a higher churn. It turns, I would think, more than 52x a year where if you have \u2013 that\u2019s a deflationary item. If you have an inflationary item that is turning 8 times in nonfoods, that\u2019s going to be a different story. That\u2019s how it impacts the business.","Karen Short","Any color on produce? That was one category you had mentioned.","Richard Galanti","I didn\u2019t have that in front of me. It was not as big. I would guess I think it was in the 3 to \u2013 low to mid-singles, back yes.","Karen Short","Inflationary or deflationary?","Richard Galanti","I am sorry it was up a little inflationary in the last few weeks.","Karen Short","Got it, okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Paul Trussell.","Paul Trussell","Hey, good afternoon, Richard. First, just wanted to ask is there anything you have seen from Sam\u2019s Club or BJ\u2019s or other competition whether it\u2019s on price or membership that you felt like you needed to react to? And then second look I know it\u2019s been, I don\u2019t know, 6 or 7 years since you have given guidance but we are moving into a new fiscal year. And just big picture, wanted to know if there is anything you can highlight that we should keep an eye on as we model out whether it\u2019s traffic, comps, thoughts on LIFO, IT spend, payroll, any help would be nice?","Richard Galanti","First of all, as it relates to competitive reaction, the answer is really no. I mean, we do that for living daily and weekly and they do it literally to their weekly comp shops in every market with direct warehouse club competition. And certainly in the fresh foods, people do more direct pricing competition on sale items at supermarkets, particularly on holiday week and some things like that and soda pop. But at the end of the day, if anything, our view is \u2013 the mode has continued to get bigger, in other words, our competitive position, pricing wise, is stronger than it\u2019s ever been. But we are not resting on that. We are constantly trying to figure out how to widen it. That\u2019s what we do.","As it relates to guidance, we don\u2019t give guidance. The points of headwinds and tailwinds and anniversary of headwinds and tailwinds, things that I have talked \u2013 we talked about in the past we are hopeful that just from a simple FX standpoint, for 2 plus years now, the dollar has strengthened year-over-year. So, it was more than a 1 year anniversary. There was an inflection point of late although nobody knows what tomorrow brings on that. But it looks like it won\u2019t be as impactful to the negative. We got through the headwind of the conversion. That should be a net positive, but I think it will be net positive over the next few years and probably not easily calculable, but we will figure that and we will try to figure that out. We know that will improve our SG&A component of what I will merchant and bank fees, in other words, things related to the new card offering. And again, we will be more quantitative as we get to the next couple of quarters. And it\u2019s more definable than just for 14 weeks. But again, it\u2019s good and we look forward to doing that. I mentioned the international membership fee increases in those certain areas. And that\u2019s, again, that will improve over nearly 2-year period by about $50 million pre-tax of the membership fee line. I imagine you will see some of that offset on some of the margin line.","Although not \u2013 to be more competitive, but not reacting to the competition. I am trying to think other things. Gas, again, I think there is a new role in gas. I don\u2019t think there is going to be swings from time-to-time, but I don\u2019t think we are planning anything big. I think the other issue is as we have and some of you heard this before, we have lots of little things that are positive for us that continue to drive value whether it\u2019s pharmacy, optical, hearing aid or whether it\u2019s Costco travel. These are all things \u2013 these are all \u2013 our ticketing program in the warehouse, a new program which is brand new. We are just testing it in Southern California, with Ticketmaster. You can go to costcotickets.com and check it out. But again, some real savings on high end stuff and so there is a lot of things we are doing. We seem to have gotten some breakthroughs on the cosmetic side with SK-II. We hope that brings on others, but very clearly given some of the challenges that brick-and-mortar in that area are impacted by, we could sell the heck out of that stuff and provide great value to our members. And it\u2019s the kind of member we believe that these manufacturers want. Now talking to myself, I have talked myself into it we have got to talk them into it. In terms of gas stations, we continue to add gas stations and hearing aids not just to new locations, but to existing locations. I would say all those things help a little bit. Hello?","Paul Trussell","And then just lastly on IT modernization spending for this upcoming year?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Look, we will still have an impact as it hits the SG&A this year and probably into next year. I see pushing it out a year. I guess, the amount I push it out keeps getting shorter. It used to be a couple of years I push it out and then a year and hopefully every 6 months, but we are seeing deliverables. We are seeing lights at the end of the tunnel. Our single biggest, most expensive piece, which is the platform on which all the legacy buying systems and transportation systems is there in the process of being rewritten and improved. And I think you will get some real savings from some of those things. I know you will. And the first order of business is getting this in place. And so these are big chunks, but I know I can tell you when that inflection point was going to be. Couple of years ago, let\u2019s say, at the end of \u201814, I would guess that some time in late \u201816 early \u201817. Today, I would say some time in \u201818, probably. And if it is a little longer, it\u2019s because we have got more things that we are doing, not because anything screwed up. We have already gotten past a lot of the scrubber. We know we are spending money on and we are seeing some deliverables and there is more to do.","Paul Trussell","Thanks for the color, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean Naughton.","Sean Naughton","Yes. Just continuing on the merchandise trends, you were going over some of these things, you didn\u2019t mention organic food, just curious kind of how that\u2019s still performing for you, I know that\u2019s been a good growth driver, I think it\u2019s a margin enhancer? Are you seeing tightness in supply? Are we experiencing the some sort of deflation in that category as you saw in the rest of the food across the store, any commentary there on where that\u2019s going?","Richard Galanti","Thank you for reminding me. No, I didn\u2019t call you to remind me. We expect organic to be up 20% this year. Now, some of that will be some cannibalizing of some traditional, conventional, but no, it\u2019s the perfect items for us, because it\u2019s our member. It helps us with millennials on top of that. We get that. It creates a bigger competitive pricing mode, because we have as good, if not better quality at much better pricing. In terms of supply, I think the supply is starting to catch up with the demand out there and I think that some of the \u2013 you have heard me talk in the past about many of our global sourcing initiatives, I think that\u2019s going to continue to help us and make it more competitively advantageous to us. We have long-term relationships that we have had for a while now and have continued to build and there is going to be pockets of supply issues on different items sometimes, but overall, we are doing a lot in that regard ourselves whether it\u2019s produce, with farmers, seafood, poultries, you name it.","Sean Naughton","Okay, great. And then just another question just I think this is on a lot of people\u2019s minds just on the membership fee increase potential here in the U.S. or Canada where I think were close to the 5-year anniversary mark. I think this is something that\u2019s \u2013 I know there is no schedule, but typically done every 5 to 6 years. Can you just update us just on your thought process there with respect to MFI in the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","It will be U.S. and Canada. We will say we can\u2019t say anything or give any direction on it other than you are right, every 5 or 6 years, we have done something. I think the exact fifth anniversary in the last time would be this January and the sixth anniversary will be the following January \u2013 this November and the next November will be the sixth anniversary. Early this year, we have simply just said is we are going to get through the credit card conversion first, which we have now done. And the only other comments I have made in the past is that when we look at our member loyalty, the impact the previous increases had on renewal rates and anything like that, it\u2019s really a non-issue. And when we do it, we of course use it to be more competitive. So, it becomes a few year benefit not a one-time benefit. And but that all being said, we will let you know when we know. We haven\u2019t made any decisions yet and we haven\u2019t talked about it a lot internally. We actually tell you when we do things.","Sean Naughton","Yes, real quick. Just the $50 million pre-tax on the international price hike that you did in a number of markets, that\u2019s over the 23 or 24 months, is that correct, right?","Richard Galanti","That would also be over 23 months starting in January \u2013 I am sorry, starting in September now.","Sean Naughton","Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Sure.","Operator","And your next question comes from Greg Melich.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions. I just wanted to make sure I understood the dynamics of the new people signing up for the card. So, it was 730,000 new signups in just a couple of months.","Richard Galanti","New accounts.","Greg Melich","Right. Of new accounts. And so now that you are getting the payments for signing those people up, in terms of the SG&A, core ops may have delevered 6 basis points, but that\u2019s where the benefit of those signups would have showed, so that the payroll may have de-leveraged 10 or 12 and then that gave you some net, is that \u2013 am I thinking about that the right way?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Although, I believe again there is different pieces, I would get it all pretty just straightforward and simple, what is our effective merchant fee. Unfortunately, it doesn\u2019t all go into the SG&A line. There are certain items that benefit sales. I believe Bounty is one of them. So, Bounty goes to sales, which improves your margin a little bit. So, that might be a couple of basis points in there. I haven\u2019t calculated it out. But yes, some of the offset, again, we are talking a small piece of a big bucket is still decent to us, but we are only in it for a few months.","Greg Melich","Got it. And the headwinds from payroll, was how much of that was related to some of the weight?","Richard Galanti","Yes, we do. It reaches the top of the scale every year. Every 3 years, we announce what it\u2019s going to be to our employees for the next three Marches. This past March we also in the U.S. and Canada raised the bottom of scale by $1.50. So, $11 50 went to \u2013 $11 went to $12.50 \u2013 no, $11.50 went to $13 and $12 went to $13.50. Just that piece, the $1.50 at the bottom scale was I believe $39 million a year, we get 40 \u2013 call it $40 million a year. That would be March to March, so through the early weeks of Q3 \u2013 through the first month of Q3.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess lastly and sort of thinking about how the card is being used, I know you said it\u2019s better than your expectations. I guess could you give us a little more color there especially with the people that are new to the card, right, new to Costco with it as to how much the card is being used outside of the club now that people have that?","Richard Galanti","I will be able to give more color on that in the next quarter. What I can tell you is one of the assumptions going into this we want this card just like we wanted our previous co-brand card to be our members top of wallet card. They are not only using it here, they are using it everywhere. The fact that historically I could not use my other card, in my case, my local drycleaner or my little local restaurant, if it is your top of wallet, there are more places you can use it. That grows that small merchant whoever card is being used at that small merchant, they pay a higher merchant fee. There is this whole equation of co-branding and revenue share helps us. And so I believe we are already above what we were on the old card in terms of outside to inside spend. It\u2019s higher than it was after growing, increasing it over a period of time, but we would have expected that. We certainly hoped it, but we have expected it. I don\u2019t think we necessarily knew what to expect to start with and we probably are little pleasantly surprised that it\u2019s already over that amount. And I think it will continue to grow. Yes, I mean, Bob was familiar that we cannot jump to conclusions on this. It\u2019s all 14 weeks old. And as it relates to new people that signed up, again, it\u2019s in the tens of thousands out of that 730,000, it\u2019s not 100,000, it\u2019s not 200,000. And I actually haven\u2019t even looked at the data on those. So, another good comment that Bob is making, it\u2019s been 14 weeks, some of them signed up last week or 2 weeks ago, I guess.","Greg Melich","One last housekeeping you said membership fee income was up 6% in U.S. dollar terms?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Greg Melich","What was it up in local currency?","Richard Galanti","I believe it was the same. It was $47 million versus $50 million, but it is the same percentage increase.","Greg Melich","Okay. Great, thanks.","Richard Galanti","Yes. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions?","Operator","And your next question comes from Oliver Chen. Oliver, your line is open.","Oliver Chen","Can you hear me?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Oliver Chen","Hi, guys. Thanks, Richard. Congrats on solid results. A lot of our survey data at Cowen does indicate that the Amazon prime crossover has mathematically increased over a multiyear period. Just what would you highlight as some of the features of your story that make you on Amazon for the long-term? And as you do your consumer insight and your consumer research are there aspects of your business model, which are just wanting to really be on top of just to make sure that you continue to appeal with millennials and generation Z and as shopping habits kind of shift?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think the first piece of that question as it relates to the Cowen research piece that talked about, I guess you guys have surveyed, remember over the last \u2013 people over the last 5 or 6 years and there are more people, how many people used to have just a Costco card and then how many people had just an Amazon account, Amazon prime. And of course, over time, Amazon has picked up a lot and there is not as many unique ones. We would have expected that. My family has an Amazon card, not a card, but an account. And although I don\u2019t let them buy a lot, no, just kidding. At the end of the day, we will expect that. The internet in general is going to take its percentage of different categories. It\u2019s going to impact different categories and different retailers of such categories at different levels. I read the reports that some of you have written about that we and maybe one or two other retailers out there that are unique are Amazon proof or Internet proof. We don\u2019t buy that for a minute. We do believe that we do rely and we do expect we are going to be impacted loss. We also don\u2019t believe we have to go crazy on the other side, but we want both. But our value proposition is best served for us when it\u2019s in-store getting members to come in and buying when they can see everything there that we have.","And so we think that we can win on both cards, have we lost a sale of something to an Internet provider out there, whether it\u2019s Amazon or someone else? I am sure we have. Have we gained more often than not? Absolutely. As the whole media business, videos, CDs and books, many years later, books for us is a new normal and it\u2019s still quite strong, maybe it\u2019s 70% or 80% of what it used to be, but it\u2019s strong and growing. The other two have changed for a lot of reasons including streaming. That being said, an area that a lot of traditional retailers are getting filled in out there is apparel. We are now in our third year averaging compounding over the nearly 3.5-year period in the low to mid-teens. Probably the mid-teens, I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me and growing. And so \u2013 and then I think on the fresh food side, fresh is difficult and we don\u2019t believe that everybody is going to just have everything delivered, but we are going to work hard to make sure that they want to come and see us. As it relates to, what was the last part of your question you were asking?","Oliver Chen","I am curious about demographics and as you think about younger versus older in your core and where your age profile is shifting, just the reality of new customers is the seamless shopping experience. And what you talked about earlier, Richard, in terms of the access of convenience being a factor in terms of that and what you are thinking as you modernize and continue to stay fresh with younger customers as well?","Richard Galanti","Well, again we have our limits by the way on some of those realities. I think for long time, again, convenience wasn\u2019t a word we even thought about. There are certain things we are not prepared to do, again, so smaller sizes in our pricing and have everything in the world available to you. Part of our strength is what we do. I think going forward even with millennials when our successor again it didn\u2019t start by 7 or 10 years ago, us sitting around on the table and saying how are we going to go after this new generation that want this staff?","We have great merchants and great operators in 8 different regions in the U.S. and elsewhere and they are out there trying things. And every month has got better, in this case, the Bay Area region, their compatriot sought another \u2013 tries things in other regions. We turn around and nobody can benefit as much and do it as good as well as we do and so I don\u2019t think we sat around strategically by saying how do we go after them and evolved into that? Now, that we are there though, what else can we do for them and whether it\u2019s food items or other things? We also look \u2013 our membership marketing people have done a study recently in our presentation recently and it showed whatever the previous generation was before, it was a gen whatever and I know I am one of those baby boomers, which is not a baby anymore. Our average age versus the U.S. population just in 3 or 4 years has come down 2 years from a 4-year gap to a 2-year gap. Our goal is not necessarily get it to a zero gap. Our goal is to drive more business. When we look at the age group of millennials versus that same age group when the previous generation was that age, they are buying a little less, but not a lot less. When we look at what we did and these are again data points or sound bytes, but when we did look what we did 2.5 years ago on LivingSocial and now we have a full year of renewals on them. It was very interesting. Clearly, we would have expected more of those people to be millennials that signed up on that LivingSocial 10 or 12-day initiative that we did. And that was correct.","What we were surprised at is that they actually shopped a little more frequently while a little less each time, but the aggregate of those two, they bought more over that year a little more, I mean, in the low single-digits, but there was more. It didn\u2019t have a bracket around it. And they renewed at a slightly higher rate. Now, then the walk in people that same months that would come in on their own just signed up, just walking together and the people that are walked in were on average a little older about 10 to 15 percentage point fewer penetration of millenials. And so that was encouraging to us. So while there is certainly extreme example in New York and the Bay Area and Teck there is a lot of people that still aren\u2019t embarrassed to tell they shop in-store and we got to have a lot of reasons to get you there. I am also excited of what we see we are going to be doing on .com, but I am not suggesting it\u2019s going to be trying to get your dinner there delivered to your doorstep if you have ordered by noon, that\u2019s not going to be us.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Thanks, Richard. That\u2019s super helpful. Last question is like we are really enthusiastic and encouraged by how well you have done with your store traffic, your core store traffic trends. Do you I mean \u2013 is your expectation for this kind of steady low single-digit positive momentum to continue? Do you foresee that being somewhat volatile just given the reality of traffic trends? And as we do our models, is there anything we should know as the .com deal closes as well? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","With regard to the latter, if they\u2019re doing a little business with us, they will probably stop doing a little business with us. There were a few items on there, I think they bought from us but not a lot. What was the first question, I got off on the tangent there?","Oliver Chen","About store traffic\u2026?","Richard Galanti","No look, we look at all these things, we block and tackle everyday. I am very excited about our merchandising initiatives in store as well. I am excited about some of the global sourcing stuff we are doing. We come back from our every four week budgeting meeting. We got some deep stuff coming out. I am excited, it\u2019s small but anyhow being able to sell directly SK-II and a heck of a lot of it in terms of the total marketing of that product and people are talking about it. And again, over 90% of our members coming into Costco buy a fresh food item. So they are coming there. Those are kind of things, how do we get you in store, because we get you in store you are going to buy a lot more than \u2013 we see that even with Google Express. That customer shop a few less times in the store, shop several more times online as well, do both. They will buy a little more over the course of the year, but they are buying a lot more each time when they go in store, because they see all that stuff. And so that\u2019s what we kind of keep doing. I think the value thing, I would encourage to look at some \u2013 do your own pricing study of exact like items, maybe you got to adjust for quantity, because you got to buy 128 or something, 124 something instead of 24 or something. But at the end of the day, you will be going to shocked, the difference in pricing, not just here and so we think we got a lot of things going on for us. We have no allusion though that the Internet is going away or that we should do more of it online our self as well. But clearly, we feel good about what we are doing in store and what we are going to continue to drive that business.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. The SK-II is going to be great, baby boomers and luxury shoppers are going to love it, so congrats on that as well.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from Brian Nagel. Oppenheimer","Dan Farrell","Hi. This is Dan Farrell on for Brian Nagel. I was just wondering \u2013 thanks for sneaking us into. In terms of the membership benefits to some of the sales benefits you guys have been seeing after the new credit card signups, I was just wondering if you had any expectation on kind of how long those would persist throughout the year?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think your big hit is going to be in the first three months or four months. And really, my guess is through Christmas, because there is going to be a lot of people buying more items, more bigger ticket items during that period of time. There will be additional initiatives like there were for 16 years whether it\u2019s tabling activities or other marketing pieces, that we will continue to do. I made a comment probably six months ago on one of these calls. In its own way, we think that this could be, in a way, a gift that keeps on giving. The value proposition of what we sell is great. Some of the new things that we have done merchandising wise whether it is our ticket not only the Costco tickets for events done in Southern California as the test, I am talking about the ticketing programs that we have in-store, the ever-increasing quality of our fresh foods, what we have done in apparel. There is a lot of things going on that I think will help us. And again I think the credit card, the new value proposition is \u2013 new value proposition will be one of them. When you think about the fact that effectively on virtually everything, you can get 4% off of Costco, between if you are an executive member and use the co-branded Costco, Citi Visa Anywhere card. For a company that markets its goods up 10% or 12% and I would think that we considered we can buy pretty well and put all our purchasing power in 3,700 items and then give you back up to 4% of that. That\u2019s a pretty good value and we have seen that anecdotally in a big way already from businesses. And I think we will continue to see it.","Dan Farrell","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up regarding the transition, did you guys see any I guess infection in sales of things like big-ticket items that people may have been holding off on any when the card is being transitioned and then once the transition card were activated, did you see any inflection in those items?","Richard Galanti","We did. Again, it\u2019s more dinner party discussion. We saw the biggest area we saw was hearing aids, a lot of things and of course that\u2019s not millennials. But \u2013 and the other thing would be big ticket electronics and the like. And my guess is in the case of the hearing aids, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised since there is a direct Costco employee member conversation eye to eye. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there were some people out there that are over there several weeks leading up to it. They said if you wait and use this card, you will get another 2% off on a $2,000 item.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Britney. Good morning to everyone. Last night\u2019s press release presented our third quarter operating results for the 12 weeks ended May 10, 2015.","Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","So to begin with, our 12-week third quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.17 a share, a 9% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter earnings results of $1.07 a share.","Couple of factors that impacted our third quarter earnings comparison year-over-year. First, FX; as compared to a year ago, in the third quarter this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar, in fact in all countries, but primarily in Canada, Mexico, Korea and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $33 million pre-tax or $0.06 a share than these earnings would have been had FX rates been flat year-over-year.","Second item of note, IT modernization. As with the past many quarter, our major IT modernization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through this fiscal year and certainly into next year, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation on those being. And in Q3, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $19 million pre-tax or 5 basis points without gas deflation and FX.","A third note, LIFO. Last year in Q3, we recorded a $12 million pre-tax LIFO charge. This year in Q3, we had a $7 million pre-tax LIFO credit, which benefited Q3 this year by $0.01 a share. And last item of note, while we enjoyed the benefit of strong year-over-year gross [ph] profits in the first half of the fiscal year, both Q1 and Q2, in Q3 it was additive, but only by $0.01 a share, so pretty much back to normal this quarter although the next quarter will be a little bit of a tougher comparison.","In terms of sales for the third quarter, total sales were up 1% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure came in at down 1%. For the quarter, sales were negatively impacted as you all know by gasoline price deflation. That represented about 350 basis point negative impact and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year. That impact was a little over 300 basis points.","So excluding gas, the reported plus 1% U.S. comp number increase in Q3 would have been a plus 5% and the reported minus 6% international comp figure excluding gas and FX impacts would have been plus 7%. Such that the total company comps reported at minus 1% for the quarter excluding gas and FX would have been plus 6% for the company.","One other item of note on sales, looking at some of the preliminary reports by analysts out there, it looks like the suggestion was that May might have gotten off to a weak start. That\u2019s not the case. The first couple of weeks of May are just fine.","And in terms of new openings, after nine new locations in the first half of fiscal 2015, including the relocation of Wayne, New Jersey, we opened four locations in Q3, one in Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, one in Merida, Mexico, which was a relocation, and one in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico. And we also converted our existing Bedford Park, Illinois warehouse into a business center. So a net of two additional locations in the third quarter.","All told, that puts our fiscal 2015 opening schedule so far through the third quarter at 10 net new locations. Next week kicks off a very buys fiscal fourth quarter expansion, which includes openings next week in Wichita, Kansas, Mobile, Alabama, and Rochester, New York. These are the first three of 14 planned new locations for the fourth quarter, including four additional new U.S. locations, one new location in each UK, Taiwan, Korea, and Mexico, and three new warehouses opening in Japan this August.","We will most likely end the fiscal year with 24 net new openings and 687 Costcos worldwide. We had originally planned to be closer to 30 for the fiscal year. However, several of these have been pushed into early fiscal 2016 due to timing and construction issues. In fact, between September 1 and the end of the calendar year 2015 or the first four months of fiscal 2016, we expect to open somewhere between 15 and 18 new warehouses. So a very busy seven-month period ahead for us.","Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, our recent common stock repurchase and dividend activities and of course additional discussion about margins, SG&A and other items in Q3.","So for our third quarter results, in terms of sales, sales for this year\u2019s third quarter for the 12 weeks ended May 10 were $25.52 billion, up 1% from last year\u2019s third quarter results of $25.23 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps were down 1%, but up 6% excluding gas deflation and FX.","For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average frequency increase of about 3.5% and an average transaction decrease of minus 4% for the quarter recognizing that that minus 4% is reported excluding FX and gas that 4% average transaction would have been plus 2.5%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region \u2013 excuse me, in terms of sales by geographic region for the U.S., the Midwest and California were the strongest. Internationally in local currencies Australia, Mexico and Taiwan posted the strongest results.","In terms of merchandize categories sales performance for the quarter, in the third quarter, within food and sundries, overall low to mid singles, deli low reported, mid if you take the FX out. Deli and frozen were the relative standouts. For hardlines, the departments with the strongest results were hardware and garden. Consumer electronics comps were slightly positive, excluding FX. Within the low single-digit softlines comps men\u2019s apparel and housewares were the standouts, and in fresh foods meat and deli were the strongest.","Now moving to the line items of the income statement, membership fees we came in at $584 million or 2.29% that\u2019s a 4% increase and a 7 basis points increase and a $23 million increase versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Again these numbers are impacted of course by FX. The $584 million number FX has been flat year-over-year at 4% dollar increase would have been 7%, up instead of 4% reporting.","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and 88% worldwide and also continuing increased penetration of our executive membership. New member signups in the third quarter were slightly down year-over-year; this has to do essentially with timing of four openings in Asia last year, two in Japan, and two in Korea, which generate typically larger than normal sign-ups.","In terms of number of members at Q3 end, Gold Star 33.2 million at Q3 end, which is up from 32.7 million 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end; primary business, the same at 7.0 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million. So all told, we ended the quarter with 43.7 million member households up from 43.2 million and including extra cards 79.6 million at Q3 end versus 78.7 million just 12 weeks earlier.","At May 10 Q3 end, paid executive members came in at 15.7 million, an increase of just about 250,000 since Q2 end or about 21,000 a week increase in the quarter. As I\u2019ve stated before executive members continue to grow, they are currently approximately 36% of our member base and approximately two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned business continues strong rounding up to 95%, Gold Star around 90% and so total within the 91% and Worldwide 88%.","Our reported gross margin for the quarter was up on a reported basis up 47 basis points from a 10.62% this last year up to 11.09% this year. And that 47 basis point increase is a plus 9 basis point increase without gas deflation. If you jot down a few numbers as I always ask you to do, we will have four columns. The first two columns will be first half of 2015 as reported. Second column will be first half of 2015 without gas deflation, and then Q3 2015 and Q3 2015 [ph] reported and without gas deflation for the third and fourth columns.","The line items, first one would be core merchandizing, the first half reported we were up 2 basis points and the first half without gas deflation it was down 17 basis points. For Q3 reported was plus 23 and without gas deflation minus 10. Ancillary businesses plus 34 and plus 29 for the first half, and for the third quarter plus 23 reported and plus 15 without gas, 2% reward minus 3 and minus 1 and for the quarter minus 6 and minus 3.","LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 and for the quarter-on-quarter plus 7 and plus 7, other was plus 3 and plus 3 for the first half and zero and zero for the third quarter. Anyway for total, for the first half we were up 38 basis points and without gas deflation up 16 and reported for the third quarter we were up 47 and as I just mentioned plus 9 on a without gas deflation basis.","Now again as you can see when these numbers, core merchandising gross margin was up 23 basis points year-over-year and down 10 without gas deflation, this is primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our ancillary businesses. The core gross margins in food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were up 10 basis points year-over-year with food and sundries and softlines being up year-over-year and hardlines and fresh foods being down year-over-year, but the net of the four on their own sales was up 10 basis points, so a good margin performance in the quarter.","Ancillary and other business grows margins were up 23 and 15 without gas deflation in the third quarter. We basically enjoyed fairly broad based strength within all of our ancillary businesses with year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas optical hearing aids and food courts, as well as proved year-over-year sales penetration within pharmacy commerce and travel, which all contributed to the ancillary gross margin improvement.","The impact from sales to our executive membership represents a 6 basis point hit to the margin or 3 basis point hit without gas deflation. This is good, it is the 2% reward feature, which reduces sales and the fact is it is more members switched to executive member, we think that\u2019s good for us long term. LIFO as I mentioned $7 million pre-tax benefit this year, compared to $12 million pretax charge last year. For a $19 million or 7 basis point year-over-year positive earnings gross margin. As I\u2019ve said many times whether these numbers are up or down on LIFO it is really part of the margin in my view. Overall, we think margins are in good shape.","Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages in Q3 year-over-year were higher by 25 basis points coming in at 10.1% of sales this year, compared to a 9.86% in last year\u2019s third quarter, but again better or lower by 10 basis points, excluding gas deflation. In terms of SG&A again, we will do the same four columns, first half 2015, both reported and without gas deflation and Q3 2015 both reported and without gas deflation.","First is operations, we were plus 6, and plus means good or lower, plus 6 reported and plus 23 without gas deflation in the first half year-over-year. We were minus 16 and plus 14 without gas deflation, the plus 14. Central minus 6 and minus 4 for the first half and minus 10 and minus 6 for the third quarter reported without gas deflation. Stock compensation minus 8 and minus 7 in the first half and plus 1 and plus 2 for the third quarter.","Quarterly adjustments were not an issue, it was zero all across the board. In total, we reported for the first half minus 8 basis points or higher by 8 basis points and when factor was better or lower by 12 basis points or plus 12, reported for the third quarter was minus 25 basis points or higher by 25, again lower or plus 10 basis point without gas deflation. The operations component again was a minus 16. Within operations, excluding gas deflation, pay roll and benefits represented 10 basis point of that year-over-year improvement.","So good expense control on payroll and stuff. The benefits, our central expense was higher year-over-year in the third quarter by 10, 6 without deflation. Again IT monetization represented about 7 of that or 5 without gas deflation in FX, so that\u2019s a big chunk of that. Equity compensation little bit of a benefit there. That fluctuate is based on when people high their 25, 30 or 35 year tenures where some of those are accelerated as well as of course every October we do the annual grant.","Next on the income statement line is pre-opening expense, no real big issues here. $16 million last year in the quarter $14 million this year. So, lower by \u2013 this expense item lower by $2 million. We had four openings in each of Q3 2014 and Q3 2015. All told, operating income for the third quarter came in at $821 million higher by $84 million or 11% from last year\u2019s operating income figure of $737 million.","Below the operating income line interest expense came in at $31 million this year versus $25 million during last year\u2019s fiscal quarter. This increase is a result of the billion dollars of senior notes issued during the second quarter in conjunction with the recent $5 per share special dividend. Interest income in other was lower year-over-year by about $3 million coming in at $9 million this year versus $12 million a year ago in the quarter.","Actual interest income for the quarter was lower by \u2013 a million of that $3 million was actual interest income. The other component is principally, which is about minus 2 million year-over-year, this principally relates to marking to market forward FX contracts used by our foreign operations, sometimes that\u2019s positive by a little, sometimes that\u2019s negative, pretty small negative this time. These swings are caused by the change in the U.S. dollar relative in those currencies.","Overall, pretax income was higher by little over 10% year-over-year or higher by $75 million in the third quarter coming in from last year\u2019s $724 million in the quarter to this year\u2019s $799 million. In terms of income taxes, our company tax rate this quarter came in right at 35.0%; that compares to 33.9% last year in the third quarter. Compared to last year our effective tax rate has gone up due to lower year-over-year percentages of earnings coming from our foreign operations. This lower penetration is primarily due to foreign exchange, as well as strong U.S. gas profits compared to last year although they are only slightly stronger. Overall, reported net income of $516 million this year in the third quarter represented a 9% increase as compared to the $473 million net income figure last year in Q3.","Now for a quick rundown of other usual topics. The balance sheet of course is included in this morning\u2019s press release, but a couple of balance sheet info items. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories reported was 100%, up from 99% a year ago. Payables of course in that number include construction payables, not just merchandize payables. If you look at just merchandize payables against inventories this year, it was also up 1%, a little better \u2013 at 90% this year versus 89% a year ago.","Average inventories per warehouse were up on a reported basis about $180,000, coming in at $13.2 million per location versus $13.0 million a year ago, up about 1%, but again FX \u2013 without FX, inventory levels per warehouse if FX had been flat year-over-year would have been up about $570,000 or up about 4% per warehouse. This increase was pretty much spread over many departments, some of which had resulted from the increased flow of backlogged inventories from the West Coast port slowdown. That\u2019s pretty much behind us and we should see some \u2013 a little of that burn off. Overall, our inventories are just fine as I mentioned in the second quarter earnings report, midyear fiscal inventories came in as good as they ever have.","In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter, we spent $555 million; in Q2, an additional $612 million; and in Q3, $421 million, so for a year-to-date total of CapEx of $1.6 billion. Given that a couple of units have been pushed into the fall, current estimate for CapEx this year is somewhere in the $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion. That compares to last year\u2019s fiscal 2014 expenditures for the whole fiscal year of right at $2.0 billion.","In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it in four countries \u2013 U.S., Canada, UK, and Mexico. For the third quarter, sales and profit were up nicely. Sales were up 18% in U.S. dollars for the quarter. And again excluding FX, our e-commerce business in local currencies, sales were up 21%.","Next on the discussion list, expansion. As I mentioned, in terms of net new openings, we opened eight in Q1, none in Q2, two in Q3, and 14 anticipated for Q4 net. So that would be 24 net increase for the year. And as I mentioned, somewhere in the 15 to 18 more in the first four months of \u2013 the last four months of calendar 2015, which will be the first four months of fiscal 2016. For fiscal 2015, again, these 24 will represent about a little over a 3.5% unit increase, so probably about a 4% square footage increase. And at Q3 end, we ended with total square footage of 96.7 million square feet.","In terms of common stock repurchases, in Q1, we started buying back a little again at $18 million in purchases in Q2, it was $92 million in purchase for that 12-week quarter and for the third quarter that 12-week quarter, we did $124 million in purchases having purchased about 839,000 shares. So, again, in terms of an annualized basis, we are doing more in Q3 than we had in the previous two quarters. Year-to-date, 234 million shares.","In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend per share increased with the May dividend payment from 35.5% to $0.40 a share for the quarter, 12.7% increase. This $1.60 a share annualized dividend represents the total cost to the company right at $700 million a year. This regular dividend of course was an addition to the $5 a share special dividend, which totaled $2.2 billion to our shareholders that was paid on February 27. It was announced in Q2, but paid in the beginning of Q3.","Lastly, next week on Wednesday, June 3, after the market closes, we will announce our sales results for the month of May, the four weeks ending Sunday, May 31. As well, our fourth quarter scheduled earnings release will be Wednesday, September 30, after market close at 6 PM Pacific Time. The earnings conference call will occur the following morning.","And with that, Britney, I will turn it back over to you for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","You are welcome. [Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel","So, Richard, two questions about gross margin. Number one, so the guest benefit moderated, but you still had a pretty good performance out of ancillary, so were there some other non-gas ancillary departments that were particularly robust, really up quite a bit in gross? That is number one. And then two, if you look at sort of core merchandise right ex deflation, so you are still down there, I know you are making \u2013 I think you're making some investments. Can you talk about how you think about tying gasoline windfall or gasoline benefit or ancillary benefit to investments in price and is one of those the idea of pass along less meat inflation because you\u2019ve got some gas wind at your back?","Richard Galanti","First of all, all the ancillary businesses were good this quarter. They generally have been good. I mean sometimes one is a little lower year-over-year but it hit all, we are up. Gas was a very small benefit year-over-year this quarter of gas profits versus the first two quarters as we mentioned in those first two quarters. And again that will cycle over the next three quarters when we had strong Q4 a year ago and strong Q1 and Q2 earlier this year, so those could be tougher comparisons.","In terms of investing in price, I mean that\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s not a scientific function here. It\u2019s an art form and we are always going to be competitive. Frankly I can remember over the past several years when we talked about just when poultry prices were skyrocketing there were some fiscal years when just that one item was $30 million or $40 million of margin reduction year-over-year \u2013 you know, $0.05 or $0.06 a share to the company, when we had no gas impact. So we do what we do when we do it when it is the right thing to do for our company from a competitive standpoint.","Certainly having strong gas profits makes it a little easier, but I wouldn't say \u2013 we don't use a certain percentage of \u2013 certainly don't use all of it, but certainly don't use some fixed percentage either. We do what we do each quarter in all of the competitive environment. I think I answered all your questions. Did I miss anything?","John Heinbockel","Well, just curious about meat, meat in particular has been very inflationary. It is a big category for you. That strikes me that that is one where you may have delayed putting some pricing through.","Richard Galanti","Yeah, well, but that\u2019s such a front and center category, when you see ads in the paper every week particularly holiday weekends for Memorial Day or July 4th or Christmas or Labor Day, you name it, and so we are always going to be tough on that. Historically when commodity prices are going up, we are the first to not have them go up as much and when they are coming down, we are going to go down as fast as we can.","I think one thing that has helped offset it a little bit over the last few years is in this tough economy, we are the ones \u2013 I remember right after the economy got hammered in late 2008, there were some fiscal quarters and calendar years 2009 and 2010 where we were upwards of a third of all the prime meat sold in the United States when usually that was nothing or very little because it all goes to restaurants and hotels. So we have a customer that when prices come down we can sell it and that kind of stuff. And on organic, we can protect our margin a little bit because everybody else is trying to make more and we try to make fair. So all those things.","By the way, the other comment \u2013 the question you asked earlier about the core being down 10, it is, recognizing core margin on core sales was up 10. The fact of the matter is all these things there is 12 buttons that you have to push in and this one pushes that one out as it relates to what is going on penetration wise, sales penetration wise. So again, we are never going to \u2013 we are going to do what we do competitively first and foremost and knock on wood at the end of the day, it comes out pretty good.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then just lastly again on the topic of mix here, so if you think about KS, just remind us the margin spread and I know it will vary by item, but margin spread KS versus a branded product, KS penetration and then is the KS margin itself staying pretty flat over time as you get a benefit you pass it along or is KS margin actually getting a little bit better?","Richard Galanti","Yeah, of core merchandise, Kirkland Signature is about a quarter of our sales and increasing. Hopefully it will continue to increase to some higher level. I would say again if I think back of some of the big volume items, paper goods, we have some KS on order, we have some KS items that are several hundred million dollars or more of sales a year. Some of the low hanging fruit originally was those are typically very competitive branded items where we can show a great savings and still make a better margin. It ranges all over the board. The difference between KS margin and branded margin could be sometimes as much as half a dozen percentage points and sometimes 1, 0 to 2.","So \u2013 and really again, and probably that\u2019s price point driven, you know if the if the right margin and something was, I mean to get to some margin percentage was right 11.39 you can well bet it\u2019s going to be 10.99, but when it goes the other way, we\u2019re not going to go up past some percentage point because we're pretty disciplined in that. So overall, I don't think \u2013 if it\u2019s changed, it\u2019s changed very little because most of those, the big wide ones have been done so many years ago. So, now the only extra of that is just a little extra penetration, but I would say that's a declining, probably a slightly declining penetration because new stuff is all over the board in different items.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning Richard. One follow-up on gas, this quarter it looked like there was a slightly different dynamic at play where wholesale prices were rising different from the prior to, you got retail prices went up a bit \u2013 national prices, right I don't know how your prices trended, but you still eked out a little bit of a benefit, did you do anything different to manage it, did you typically lag, I guess the market, but where you more cognizant of the interplay between wholesale cost and retail prices this quarter?","Richard Galanti","Nothing out of the ordinary, no.","Simeon Gutman","Okay and then my follow-up is on investments in SG&A spending, I think we asked this once a quarter, regarding the timing in terms of when investments crest and when we should start to see those investments dwindle?","Richard Galanti","In terms of IT?","Simeon Gutman","Correct.","Richard Galanti","Yeah, I think if I go back two and a half years ago, we felt that probably sometime in early 2016, maybe I\u2019m off by half a year or a year, so maybe still longer, but good news is the denominator in that calculation keeps getting higher to the sales denominator, but we're just starting to see some of those big projects and we've got several of them. The installed and that's when you start that amortization of those items. So we will still see it eke up a little bit over the next \u2013 certainly the next four quarters maybe six, it's hard to predict maybe it\u2019s seven, I don't know yet, but it\u2019s going as planned and part of the plan in a tongue-in-cheek way was whatever we think it\u2019s going to be, it\u2019s going to be a little more.","Simeon Gutman","And when you said 2016 are you referring to calendar or fiscal?","Richard Galanti","Well, I\u2019m referring to fiscal, but it could be a little longer than that, but if it is, it\u2019s coming down as, these are smaller in my view, smaller, they\u2019re going to be smaller year-over-year higher SG&A basis points than they have been, but you will have to wait and see guys. Things are going along, knocked on with the things we have installed so far, each time we install something we're getting better than the last installation, but as with this IT stuff it takes a little longer than we originally planned.","Simeon Gutman","Okay thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler","Hi Meredith Adler from Barclays. Hi Richard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of inflation in chicken and eggs because of avian flu?","Richard Galanti","No I don't know completely, I do know that there was requirement in California in terms of something related to eggs that caused egg prices to come up and if you want to follow-up with me, I am happy to find out, I just don't know on the top of my head.","Meredith Adler","Well then more theoretically, I do actually, it has to do with giving the birds, the hens bigger cages and that meant there was a shortage of supply, I learned that from another retailer yesterday, but what is your philosophy about chickens and rotisserie chicken pricing if you see a big increase are you going to do what you've done before, which is just maintain your retail price?","Richard Galanti","Well I\u2019ll proceed, I can only tell you what history has shown us, is that when others were raising their chicken prices from 4.99 to 5.99 we were willing to \u2013 if eat if you will $30 million, $40 million a year in gross margin by keeping it at 4.99 and that's what we do for a living.","Meredith Adler","Can you talk also just more generally about food inflation both in the U.S. and outside the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","On the protein site it\u2019s been involved for various reasons, pork was volatile because of a virus that reduced the supply. The beef was, as I understand in an 18 month transition where grain prices when feed prices skyrocketed, certain part of that 18 month cycle of growing cattle was reduced as people, as farmers sent them to process sooner because it was too much, it cost too much to feed them. And so we are going through that cycle of limited inventory there and then there is also higher demand overseas, which has been muted a little bit by the stronger dollar. So, again it is just like predicting anything you never know what it is going to be until it gets there. When I look overall, looking just down the list of the most deflationary and inflationary items in the last month, you've got some beef items on there for sure and that's 8% to 20% range year-over-year.","On the deflationary side, again it is all over the board there is some \u2013 nothing that stands out in terms of big trends. So, I think overall proteins are up a little more than they have been three and six months ago in terms of that expectation and the expectation, the, I will pick up comment from one of our senior buyers on the fresh foods, on the pork, beef, and poultry sidewise as they come down a little bit you can be assured that they will go back up and as they go up a little bit you can be sure they will come back down.","So, again it is hit and missed, when I get back to my comment, I made earlier in this call, when prices are, when these types of prices are going up, we're going to try to hold off as long as we can and when they are going down, rest assured we are going to be the first out there lowering them, but it is a very competitive field out there. We are benefiting, I think a little bit with the increasing organic and fresh foods in general not necessarily protein, but I think that trend of benefiting from that will \u2013 should continue from the standpoint that there is more supply of organic out there.","Meredith Adler","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Unidentified Analyst","Yeah, good morning. This is Stephen at Cowen on for Oliver today, thanks for taking our questions. Looking at international, can you provide an update where you guys are versus your long-term potential, you know currently international is about 30% of your star base, could that get to 50% over time and then we understand you know France is the next country you guys are going to enter, any other new markets you are looking to consider?","Richard Galanti","Well international is going to be most likely continue to grow if you think about it on a base of about 480 U.S. we are opening 12 or 14 year this year and about half in the US half International where that number of openings internationally on a smaller basis of total international right now is a lot bigger and that will continue and I think even the percentage of annual openings each year will continue to grow outside of the US as we, as that is limited. If anything I would probably was as our expectations five years ago that is probably more opening then we had anticipated so that is good news from the US but we will still but we will see still seeing more grow internationally, could it be 50-50 one day, probably, I'm not sure when but it will keep growing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay and then just and then I guess like specific we would like to get your views on the competitive environment, you know some of your traditional warehouse competitors are struggling and then conversely there is a lot of new grocery concepts that are emerging, how do you guys see the environment changing and then do you think there's an opportunity for Costco to eventually have a, you know like a new store concept or a modified store concept, thanks very much.","Richard Galanti","Well it\u2019s always a competitive field, I mean there is some great supermarket changes out there both nationally and regionally, we still respect our direct competitors. I think, one of the good things about our concept from my view is that I look at organic, it started off small, it is still small relative by growing faster and there is certainly more supply of that out there and it\u2019s where we shine in terms of quality and value and I think that\u2019s nothing but a positive for us going forward at this point. I don't see us doing, you know many years ago we tried a smaller box size concept in the 72,000 foot range compared to the \u2013 probably back then the average Costco was in the 135, 140, we are building Costco\u2019s in the 155 range now, in terms of thousand square feet.","I don't see us trying a smaller box anytime in the near future because we got plenty going on with the regular sized box. I mentioned on the call earlier we converted the Bedford, Illinois unit from a warehouse club to a business center, that\u2019s our 10th business center. I think the last five of those 10 business centers over the last four or so year \u2013 five years, we will probably open a couple of three of those a year going forward as they have started to perform better, but again we will see. That is pretty much what we have going on at this point and so far so good.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","John Parker","Good morning. This is actually John Parker on for Chuck. I guess can we dig into the core margins by category a little bit and I mean it seems like the 10 basis point improvement as a percentage of owned sales is the best in a few quarters. So kind of what drove that performance I guess in the food and sundries and softlines categories?","Richard Galanti","Yes, well, again food and sundries, softlines was bigger improvement year-over-year than food and sundries. In fact, I don't remember if it is because it was a weak comparison to last year. Foods has a much bigger penetration mind you. Food and sundries is our biggest core category. And there is nothing specific. Again I think that we feel that we are able to make a little more margin mostly by buying better and keeping a little of it but passing more of it on. When we look at our competitive [indiscernible] versus our direct competitors if anything the gap is improving, it is getting bigger a little bit, not a lot.","So it is not like \u2013 and so in our view we are as if not more competitive while still showing some improvement in the core. But as many of you know who have known us for a long time, we could make a little more if we wanted to and sometimes if we need to and sometimes if we need to we don't because it\u2019s the right thing to do. So I think we feel at this point quite comfortable with where our margins have been and hopefully that will continue.","John Parker","Got it. Thanks. And then just switching gears a little bit, can you provide an update on some of the digital initiatives you guys are doing like e-commerce, Tmall with Alibaba, Google Express and Instacart?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, pretty much the same as a quarter ago. We are certainly testing in six markets with Google and probably a few other merchants with Google, the Google Express Shopping. Instacart has expanded to more cities with their announced capital raise a few months ago. And there's a couple of other smaller ones in some regional markets and so that is good. We are agnostic. We are working with all of them. We like to sell merchandize and we will see where it goes.","In terms of Tmall, I think we've got about 160 items on there and it\u2019s doing quite well. We don't disclose numbers on it, it\u2019s still small of course. But I would say certainly significantly better than we expected to start with. And the good news is it\u2019s getting our name known over there and as more stuff is shipped in, and more to Kirkland Signature name than the Costco name frankly and that\u2019s good too.","In terms of other digital initiatives, I know we did one thing in one of our smaller regional markets with Groupon, but relatively small, good results, but small impact, a small geographic impact and that is pretty much it at this point. We plan an e-commerce \u2013 again, we are currently in three \u2013 in four countries. In the next 12 months we will be in two more and probably a seventh, if you will, the third of three more will be probably a year and a half, two years out and so that is a business that is more profitable as a percent of sales than the core business and still relatively small. It\u2019s big, it\u2019s $3 billion plus, but I'm happy to say over the last probably 10 or so 2.5, 2.75 years, we\u2019ve seen year-over-year increases right around 20%, 18% to 20%, which is both \u2013 mostly comp, and so that\u2019s been pretty good for us.","John Parker","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning, Richard. Thanks a lot for taking my question. You have been putting up such great traffic trends for so long, I think some of it has been due to the improvement in your fresh, rolling out more gas stations. How long can that continue? What is your expectation on the sustainability of the recent traffic performance?","Richard Galanti","Well, you know, we cross our fingers and hope it will continue. I mean we are out there every day trying to get new items and new exciting stuff and lower some of our prices. And organics has helped, gas helps. We are still certainly as many new locations that can get gas gets it which is more than the company average and there is still several out there that existing locations that we are fighting hard to get gas stations or buying land next door or appealing the 12th appeal out there ourselves in one city I can think of. But at the end of the day, that is what we do. So fresh \u2013 in my view, fresh foods, gas, executive membership, opening in new geographic markets outside of United States, all those things are net positives.","I remember when the economy kind of crashed in late 2008, I remember at the end of calendar 2009 when we had a full year of right around 4% maybe 4.1% or 4.2% frequency increases, I remember warning everybody that if it\u2019s zero in calendar 2010, that\u2019s a 2% compounded, which is better than our historical average so how can we sustain that? We are now six years of a little over 4% compounded. In my view, anything in and around that range we will continue to try to do, but there is no predicting it.","Michael Lasser","And you are not \u2013 are you seeing any differences in the month-to-month like more variability\u2026?","Richard Galanti","Where the variability has been of late is Easter fell two or three weeks different year-over-year so it is kind of like you need to look at an eight week average, the two-month average or eight- or nine-week average, not just a given week because the numbers are a little screwy trying to compare them when there's things like that. Same thing with Memorial Day, which is I think a week different.","Michael Lasser","Okay. And then on the return of cash, you have been stepping up activity [indiscernible] in the market over the last couple of quarters. Should we expect that to continue? It sounds like you also like the special dividend, so how are you going to balance out the activity? Thank you so much.","Richard Galanti","Well, I think what we\u2019ve said in the past is, is that, generally speaking, we generate more cash than we spend on ramped up CapEx, although ramped up CapEx will be our first and foremost directive. We do have a little debt to pay down. We are cognizant of the fact that I think as a board to be pro-shareholder and having done now, we have two data points for special dividends, but two points does not a trend make, but it worked pretty well and we will see what the future brings.","I think in terms of stock buybacks, I think as I mentioned in the past, we will continue to buy sometimes on a regular basis, sometimes periodically, but we don\u2019t know \u2013 as long as we feel good about the long-term of our company, we don\u2019t know when we are going to be complete right or a little wrong and so if we buy over a longer period of time on a regular basis, we generally like that way to do it. And we certainly picked up in the last couple of quarters and there is no reason to change that. But let\u2019s see what tomorrow brings.","Michael Lasser","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning to you. First of all, any initial thoughts on the transition process as you move away from AmEx to your new credit card deal whether there is any friction in the process? And when do you think you will get visibility or maybe will get visibility on how the economics impact the offer in your financials?","Richard Galanti","Right. Well, there is not a lot we could say at this point. Needless to say we are excited about it. I\u2019m not excited about the transition because there is work to be done, but we are getting through that. And there is really not a lot that we could be able to say about the new program other than needless to say we wouldn\u2019t have done this unless we found it was better for our members. And just like when we price goods, the old adage was for every dollar we save, we give $0.90 to the customer, that\u2019s not a fixed formula needless to say, but we are going to give most of it to the member and it\u2019s a lot and we will let you know next March or April.","Matthew Fassler","That\u2019s very helpful. Second question, just thinking about the U.S. comp ex-gas that you reported and trying to square it with the monthly data that comes out, I know that the months don't align with the quarters necessarily. But I think you had two 7s and a 4 and the straight average of that would be around a 6 and you printed a 5. So what would account for the variability in the U.S. comp ex-gas that we saw for the quarter and the months that comprised most of it?","Richard Galanti","Well, without even looking at it, it's two things. It\u2019s going to be rounding and it\u2019s going to be the months don\u2019t align with the quarters. Part of February was the end of Q2 and part of it was the beginning of Q3, the same thing with May. The first week of May was part of Q3 and the next three weeks are going to be part of Q4. I did mention earlier in the call because we did see a comment or two, I don\u2019t know if one of those was from you that there was some that suggested perhaps May was getting off to a weak start and that\u2019s not the case.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. That is helpful. Finally, Spain, if you just give us some early thoughts on what you are seeing and just kind of lessons learned if you will going forward as you think about Europe more broadly?","Richard Galanti","Well, basically as I\u2019ve said, but people have asked sales were a little less than we have planned, but growing nicely and membership sign-ups are just fine, probably a little stronger than our original plan and the renewals so far are good. So, recognizing, our first opening there was where we could open first in terms of timing that\u2019s Seville and we are excited about being there. Our next two openings which would be later this calendar year and early next calendar year will be two units in Madrid, which is a bigger market and so we are \u2013 it is again a little lower sales than originally planned, but membership sign-ups are good and actually a little better than planned, so we will be fine.","Matthew Fassler","And cost of doing business and the whole cultural dynamic you are finding is in sync with what you expected?","Richard Galanti","Yeah it is as expected. The good news is whatever the labor issues or policies we know that we have got great product and services and the best prices and people seem to like it and as it relates to any restrictions on labor or whatever or closing in some countries, in one country in Asia we have to close two Sundays a month as to other big boxes. So, the good news is it rains on everybody and we think all things being equal we\u2019ve got a good competitive stance.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning, guys. So, I wanted to follow up on the traffic question a little differently. So if I look at the trend, so last August traffic inflected by about 100 basis points to 150 basis points from the prior rolling average. If I look at the March, April period together, it looks like it decelerated back down to 3.5. So, I guess what do you attribute the acceleration and then recent deceleration to? And does it line up at all with sort of how your gallonage comps changed over that period as you had widened the gap out versus the market bringing price down more slowly?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. If I knew the exact answer I would retire and just give that out on a consulting basis. A lot of \u2013 some of it I think has to do with gas when the prices fall dramatically, we get a lot more press, but then I remember when prices were very low we were getting bumps in gallonage like we had never seen before in the low double digits on a gallonage comp basis. So, there is no, nothing is that predictive. I think the last couple of months, I remember several weeks ago we were looking at a several week period and again frequency had come down like you say to the \u2013 from something above a 4 to something below, you know in the mid-to-high 3\u2019s and we say is this the beginning of that then the next week it was back up","So, it is really not predictable, if you ask me six years ago and today is 4% sustainable, no, but we are going to keep working at it, one of the things that could help it go in positive directions adding gas stations to existing units not just in the U.S. and Canada, but elsewhere. We have a couple, two or three in Australia, one or two. I think three and a couple more coming. We are going to open about in a couple of other countries. Again it\u2019s a little relative to the whole pie, but its lots of little things, that\u2019s one of them. Fresh foods, I\u2019m convinced there is still going to be a driver going forward.","Opening new warehouses and new markets that are much less saturated markets will help that number. So, I think all the executive membership penetration increasing will help that number. What won\u2019t help the number is that there is, you know it is a hard number to sustain and I am pleased to say that for six and a half years we have and we will see what tomorrow brings again and we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re doing and all those things would help.","Chris Horvers","Absolutely, and I think we all agree like that 3.5% to 4% is sustainable. Did you see, what were gallonage comps? I think if you look back to past gas price drop, they are running sort of mid-single digits. They had I think revved up to about 15%. Had they come back down to closer to 5% in this most recent quarter?","Richard Galanti","I honestly don\u2019t have that in front of me. We generally don\u2019t give that out we probably \u2013 it comes out occasionally when it went above 10, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s above 10, but it\u2019s certainly positive. I just don\u2019t know on the top of my head.","Chris Horvers","Understood, understood. And then as you think about lapping the gas margin benefit in the upcoming quarters, I guess you don't guide, but you have a lot of positive things going on underneath in the margin structure, core margins. You are getting better payroll leverage than you had prior. So, I guess what\u2019s the degree of difficulty in terms of actually seeing margin expansion as you lap those, I guess two big quarters where you had 10s of basis points of gas benefit?","Richard Galanti","You are talking about operating margins?","Chris Horvers","Yes.","Richard Galanti","Look we are up against \u2013 Q4 of last year was the first in a while outsized gasoline profitability, should be pretty good this quarter, but I don\u2019t know if we get all the way, I don\u2019t think we get all the way where we were last quarter and then as I mentioned in Q1 and Q2, they were outsized to some extent. Again Q3 it is not even a factor other than the factor is it is virtually nothing versus it was bigger in those three fiscal quarters. So that will be a tougher comparison. Mind you we\u2019ve also got hit by it seems like $0.04, $0.05, $0.06 a quarter on FX.","At some point the dollar is going to slow down and shrink and maybe even reverse a little bit, I don\u2019t know when and if and when, maybe it\u2019s another year of FX weakness for us first and but at some point I think that impact will mitigate. So, the good news is that some of these outside gas quarters have been equally hit by outsize FX hits just because of the strong U.S. dollar, maybe there is a couple of quarters in there where you get both hits, but as long as we are \u2013 we are really worried about driving frequency, driving sales, the unit sales as well and having mid strong membership sign-ups in renewal rates and all those things are good. Again, we recognize that looking at some metrics there maybe a couple of tough comparisons in the next several quarters, but that\u2019s what we do.","Chris Horvers","And then just one last follow-up. You have had 10 basis points to 20 basis points of payroll leverage these past couple of quarters despite a total reported comp that was hit 600 basis points, 700 basis points by FX and gas., so your leverage point seems a lot lower now, so should we expect that to continue as you go against the tougher gas margin comparisons? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","By the way that 10 plus basis point has payroll end benefits and chunk of it has also been healthcare not this quarter, but in couple of recent quarters before this quarter with a little bit of workers comp benefit too. By the way what helps those numbers also has increased foreign expansion. There is a \u2013 just on benefits, which is primarily healthcare medical, dental, and vision in a large extent. They are U.S. versus other countries. In some countries there is 40 basis points to 60 basis points of delta just on that SG&A item because healthcare cost in the U.S. are so much higher than everywhere else.","And then payroll, our 22 or just under 22 on an hour average in the U.S. we have comparable premiums above other retail in each country, but in some countries that comparable is $11 or $12 not $22. So, increasing penetrations of some of those countries help. So, we\u2019ve got some of those things helping us irrespective of everything else. I think, we focus on payroll and benefits, which is whatever 70% of SG&A, 60% plus of SG&A more than anything and if we can drive sales that helps a lot. And what also helps those numbers fortunately is increased penetration outside the United States. But in the last couple of quarters, we also benefited on healthcare in the United States as we started to see a few things we've changed like preferred provider networks, but still giving great coverage to our members \u2013 to our employees.","Chris Horvers","Very helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning and thank you for, first of all, taking all those questions. I want to just follow up on comments you are making around international margin. We will find out more details in the 10-Q around the specific performance of Canada and international margins in this period versus the U.S. But just speaking broadly and historically, you\u2019ve had 150-basis point to 200-basis point favorable gap in your international markets versus the U.S. As we think about your continued expansion where there may be some impact with cannibalization as we think about your move into Europe, the relationship that you have with Alibaba, with Tmall or any other external factors regarding competitive changes or labor costs in some of these markets outside the U.S., how do you feel about the sustainability of these high 3% to 4.5% margins in those markets? Is that sustainable or do you think that will over time contract closer to the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","You know, if I were a betting person, it's going to be higher than the U.S. I think what I have said in the past is, is that ultimately some of the highest profitable countries will come down a little, but still going to be higher than the U.S. There is just so many moving parts to that question in terms of what. I think when we go into a new country by definition we lose money for the first few years as we did in Japan many years ago. And then when we went from nine to 20 units in about a two-year period in Japan, we cannibalized the hell out of the existing units. We have now started to see that improve and we are going \u2013 the rest of this calendar year we will open four more in Japan and several more in the future.","So I think that at least for the foreseeable future, we will see stronger profitability percentages outside of the U.S., but hopefully we can see the U.S. number improve a little too. But having an increased sales penetration outside the U.S., which has a higher than U.S. profitability should help a little. And again, that is why we say that statement at the beginning of this thing, whatever we say today we don't have to update tomorrow until we talk to you again in a quarter. But overall I think that those trends will continue but when we open a new country by definition, we get hit a little bit but it is a little bit on a much bigger company today too.","Paul Trussell","Understood. And just regarding the store count and growth, I missed some of your comments and I apologize, but I know that \u2013 I think the new forecast for 24 \u2013 is for 24 store openings this year with some slipping into the first quarter. What was that \u2013 at this point in time, what would your crystal ball say around fiscal 2016 openings given this slippage? Would it still be around 30 store openings as you think about next year?","Richard Galanti","I would say 30 or low 30s. What\u2019s going to happen just like this year, I think if I go back to the beginning of time, we are going to be in the 30 or the low 30s, inevitably 10 or 12 of those are in the last six weeks of the fiscal year. We are pushing for it, we are trying. Inevitably things happen whether it\u2019s cold weather or you have to wait for the ground to thaw out or some other roadblock with one of the permits to get open. And so there are lots of different reasons.","But when we started, this was kind of our best guess stretch effort and inevitably a few fall out. I think a few more than we had planned fell out into next quarter, but it is a matter of months, it is not a matter of reducing something that fell out of bed completely. That happens less frequently. So I think the 30+ number this year came down to an actual 24 gives me a lot more confidence next year's 30, low 30 number is much more achievable. But if we do 15 to 18, if we only do 15 in the first four months that gives me pretty good confidence we can get to 30 for sure. But for sure is a guess until we get there next year.","Paul Trussell","Understood. Thank you. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Benedict","Hey, Richard, a couple of things. Just back to the sales to make sure I'm thinking about this correctly, your April sales release allows you to kind of calculate the 11 week sales growth number for the quarter was like up 0.8% and then the quarter full 12 weeks was up 1.1% so it seems pretty clear that that May started off at least on a pretty healthy note relative to how trends had been for the rest of the quarter. Is that the right way to look at it?","Richard Galanti","Well, it\u2019s consistent with what I said at the beginning of the call about the first couple of weeks of May are just fine.","Peter Benedict","Okay, good. The other \u2013 executive membership rollout, you are currently I think in four countries. Can you remind us how you are thinking about that, what would it take for you to kind of start introducing that into some other countries?","Richard Galanti","We like the executive membership program. In our view, we need at least a core base of units to do it because you want to go out there and not \u2013 and while the 2% reward is certainly an important part of the executive membership program, so are many of the executive member services and other benefits. And we need more than a few units to do that. But we like it and if we could have it everywhere, one day we will. We want to be able a bit more true with more locations in a market.","Certainly in the UK with something in the mid-20s and Mexico in the low to mid-30s number of units and certainly Canada and the U.S. With Japan, 20 going to 24, that \u2013 just looked at how many units we have and I'm not suggesting \u2013 I don't know if we have any plans currently to do it. Right now our plans are to get a bunch more openings in these countries and the country past those four with the most units right now is Japan and that trend will continue. So we will see.","Peter Benedict","Okay. And then lastly, just the gas mix in the third quarter, what was it as a percentage of sales and what was it a year ago? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","I believe it was about somewhere between 9and 10 for this quarter and I am guessing we are looking it up as we speak, but I'm guessing it\u2019s somewhere in the 11 range, maybe 12. 9 this year, 11 last year rounding.","Peter Benedict","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First just housekeeping, I don't know if I missed this, but can you talk about your membership fee income growth excluding the impact from FX?","Richard Galanti","Sure. I think, again, dollars assuming flat FX was up 7% for the quarter, which is I think ends up 7 basis points, so overall a good number. I think again that\u2019s partly the fact that sign-ups are doing pretty good and partly rental rates continue to be good and partly conversions to executive member. When I look at all of those components, the one thing that continues to surprise me from a number of years ago, the number of new executive members, which is a combination of sign-ups and higher percentage of new sign-ups being to the executive member in those countries than it had been historically and conversions. So that\u2019s continuing to be probably a little bit number than I would have guessed. Anybody who has wanted it, already has it, but I think we are doing a better job of communicating to the member why it is a good deal.","Kelly Bania","Got it. That is helpful. And then Richard, you mentioned organics a couple of times already. Just curious if you could talk about what the run rate is for that business at this point in terms of dollars that you are doing in organic foods and what the opportunity is? Really you mentioned supply maybe a little bit challenging, what are you doing to work around that?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, I think it was about six or nine months ago I had mentioned that, it was about $3 billion, up kind of a double in the past two years. I guess that at least it has a 4 in front of it now given just extrapolating that and probably the challenges are still out there although they are becoming less formidable because we like everybody else \u2013 there is more organic supply and producers doing it. And we are pretty good at getting out there and working with suppliers, both here and around the world to commit more to it, whether it\u2019s raising eggs or ground beef processing or produce, and so it is going to still \u2013 it should still drive sales and drive incremental sales. I have given a couple of anecdotal examples over the last couple of years, one of that was when we introduced organic fresh ground beef 80% of it was to existing members that like us, but never bought ground beef from us because they are organic ground beef buyers and so it had the benefit of incremental, mostly incremental business to us at a little better margin at a greater savings versus our competitors because it is organic. And so that will continue to be nice, but it is, I put it under that category of \u2013 the good news is it is a lot of different things and certainly that\u2019s one of them.","Kelly Bania","Great, that is helpful. If I could just also ask about produce supply in the quarter. Some complaining about a tough growing season, maybe a little bit of impact from the ports, did you see any impact from that and if so, is it getting better now or just any color there?","Richard Galanti","The remarks I always get from our fresh foods buyers are as soon as something good happens and something doesn\u2019t \u2013 something bad happens. The only impact in terms of sales from the port issue was exporting. We do a great business and Asia is an example and Australia, and while a lot of that fresh stuff is sent on \u2013 is air freighted anyway, whatever incremental was required was air freighted as well, so probably impacted margin a little bit to the negative and supply a little bit to the negative overseas. Other than that I know berries which is a big business for us, is very depended on what\u2019s going on with weather and crop and that was hit a little bit in the last couple of months, but notwithstanding that, our fresh margins were actually quite good in the last month or two.","Kelly Bania","Okay, thanks. That is helpful.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark Miller","Hi, Richard. I know the new member sign-ups were impacted by the club openings in Asia last year, but I guess a little bit bigger question, a bigger picture question, could you give us some insight into the portion of new member sign-ups that are coming from the younger demographic versus the long-term historical mix at Costco?","Richard Galanti","I know it is more, I don\u2019t have the numbers completely in front of me and in our view it\u2019s two reasons it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s a couple of the things we did like living social, which was a lot more than that, but actually the gap between our average age members and the U.S. average age has actually been reduced a little bit. I think we\u2019ve historically been a couple of years older than the average U.S. and now it\u2019s a little bit less than that. So, all I can tell you is it\u2019s trending in the right direction. We are not terribly concerned about at this point, we are seeing younger people join us and certainly we know that some of the things that we are not doing like organic is a part of that.","Mark Miller","Oh that\u2019s great because clearly Costco is getting business from other retailers that are hurt by e-commerce, but you would think that younger demographic, the millennial might be converting to e-commerce at a faster rate \u2013 so\u2026","Richard Galanti","They maybe, but not everybody is going to sit at home and do everything. I maybe in a small group here, but I actually enjoy going to Costco and I know a lot of people too. And it\u2019s kind of hard to get gas delivered to you. And if we can get you in the parking lot that helps. So, ultimately it\u2019s value. We recognize that convenience is value and we are not the best at some convenient side, so we\u2019re not going to the be company that delivers two different cereals to your doorstep at 7 AM, as long as you order by 10 PM the night before, soon by 3 AM in the morning probably. But we will sell to some of those people and more importantly there is a lot of reasons to come into Costco.","So, we have a unique value proposition. I think we benefit while all \u2013 first of all we will get some of the e-commerce business in addition to the extent that all of us, every brick and mortar loses something to e-commerce incrementally, we probably will lose at least so far a little less incrementally, but we are also gaining incrementally on market share of other things. So, all those things help us, but I can tell you, we don\u2019t have our head in the sand, but we\u2019re not going to \u2013 we know there is certain things we can\u2019t do as well. But what we can do really well is value in terms of quality and the things that we saw and we will keep doing that.","Mark Miller","Yeah, it\u2019s clearly working. Other question is the 2% reward impact in the fiscal third quarter, minus 3 basis points versus minus 1 basis point in the first half all ex-gas, I\u2019m assuming that FX may be partly contributing to that because of smaller penetration outside the US. But is there anything else that is causing that?","Richard Galanti","That\u2019s it. No, mind you any basis point or two hit to that number means an increasing penetration to that group. Not only new executive members, but executive members shot more frequently and buy more.","Mark Miller","Exactly. All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi Richard, I just have one question. I think you said you are launching two new e-commerce sites in new countries in the next 12 months and one more the year after. Can you tell us what those countries are?","Richard Galanti","I think they are two of the three Asia countries and \u2013 Korea and Taiwan I believe.","Bob Drbul","And so where does that put you overall in terms of the total number of countries that you will be operating in on e-commerce?","Richard Galanti","We are in nine countries, mind you one location in Spain and seven in Australia. So, we are nine countries, we currently are in four, so put us at six of nine, but a higher percentage that\u2019s six ninths of number of warehouses needless to say.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani with Evercore ISI.","Michael Montani","Hey guys good morning. I wanted to ask about IT modernization. You obviously mentioned some of the costs that are involved. Can you just update us on the benefits that you are seeing now and where we are at in the process and timeline of the rollout?","Richard Galanti","A little tongue in cheek, the biggest benefit is, is we haven\u2019t screwed it up. We probably felt that we should have been modernizing for a number of years. We were really good at keeping stuff cheap and band-aided and we also recognized that if we are going to trying to try to double our business in the next ten years and that\u2019s around, it is not a plan, it\u2019s just 7% compounded for 10 years is a double. But going into more countries and doing more things than we need better systems and because first of all we are going to outgrow, we were starting to see the seams of some of the existing systems.","So, first and foremost it was a necessity. Secondly, as a very simple example, our membership system. There is two ways you can change your mailing address or your phone number or anything else or add-on or take of a business add-on member. You call it 800 number or you come into the membership desk. Soon you will be able to do that online, but I recognize we\u2019re not the first to do that, but there is still lot of things like that. We think that there is big savings in transportation management and a lot of little things like that membership thing, if you think about, if we\u2019ve got 40 plus million member households only a small percentage of us have to want to change their address or move or change of members on it or change of phone number and you can think about how many millions fewer of these can be done online instead of talking to somebody at Costco.","We are seeing some benefits in the membership desk, but we are just rolling it out. So, I\u2019d say there is still more cost to benefit. The big benefits are to come when we get like the depot and transportation management systems, when we get the buyers on the new system, after I\u2019m sure a little bit of indigestion that\u2019s still a year and a half out that\u2019s kind of the culmination of other modules that are going into place soon. Let me just look here one other thing. You know in service so far, a new payroll system, which is not a big benefit, but it was a big necessity. The members in point of sales systems are new and there is some efficiencies in the point of sale.","Both inefficiencies and enhancements to be able to do all the things we are doing with \u2013 we and other retailers are doing with security and things like that, data security. Pending again the big ones, the main accounting system will go in next, merchandising will shortly follow, and again the depot management system will be a little earlier than that I believe. But any big benefits from it will be at least a year out, maybe more. We are starting to see some little benefits from some of the things that we have done, but the big news is that it is working so far, costing more than we expected, taking a little longer than we expected, but it\u2019s working.","Michael Montani","Great, thanks. And then to follow up on categories just for a minute in consumer electronics, you guys I think were up a little bit there, which is impressive given the West Coast port. So can you just give us some color on kind of TV units and ASP and just what is driving the strength?","Richard Galanti","I don't have that in front of me. I think for the last few months, I mean TV sales have been up slightly on average in terms of dollars. My guess is \u2013 again, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but ASPs have probably come down a few percentage points. We tend to sell bigger ticket TVs and the newer ones, the bigger screens as an example. But if anything I\u2019d guess that the dollar number is in the low single digits, low to mid single digits and the ASP represents a low single to maybe upper middle-digit number and it fluctuates a little every month. I'm sorry, that\u2019s what I can recall.","Michael Montani","Got it. Thanks. And the last question I had was just more conceptual, which is if you think about some of the competitive set and what they have been doing, one change that a competitor has done recently is rolling out by online, pickup in club and it seems to have made a material impact on their business. Can you just talk a little bit about the puts and takes that you guys would have from a labor model standpoint as well as cross-shop treasure hunt standpoint of potentially doing something like that? And the follow-up to that is another competitor has got a beta test this summer with $50 shipping. I understand there is Google Express and so forth, but should we expect any direct response to that or is it kind of wait and see and how you think through those two things?","Richard Galanti","There is no current plan for any direct response to it. We do at our business centers deliver to businesses, not to homes. But again, what we are doing so far is working pretty well for us. Your one comment or suggestion about that the incremental buying when somebody is actually in-store, it is huge. We want them in store and when you order online, there is a cost and a convenience in terms of just ordering and picking up. We would like not to have to do that and so there are no plans right now given how we are performing. We always monitor what others are doing. There is a lot of things that others do from giving away memberships more freely or more discounted to advertising in newspapers. I am sure they work, but it is nothing that we want to do at this point.","Michael Montani","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hi, guys. Thanks and thanks for letting it go so long. I will be quick. I just wanted a housekeeping item. I know you said the renewal rate was 91% in the U.S., Richard. Do you actually have the exact number? Do you know the exact number? I know, I think, it was like 90.7% last time; I was just trying to understand what the exact number is.","Richard Galanti","It still rounds up to 91%. We try to just keep \u2013 it is about the same, maybe [indiscernible] \u2013 it is about the same.","Scott Mushkin","Okay. Second question, when you do the tech and some of the updates, I know you said the membership desk and whatnot and obviously the ancillary businesses are going well, but the constant feedback we get from people, members, is, gosh, I didn't really realize Costco did travel or car buying programs or garage doors or some of the other stuff you guys do. I mean, is there \u2013 how do you envision maybe getting the word out better to the membership base over time? And then \u2013 that is my last question.","Richard Galanti","I think that\u2019s a good point. Word of mouth is certainly something that we rely on a lot. I think we do a better job today even in the Costco Connection and again, our membership marketing department is starting to test a few things whether it\u2019s on different internet sites and what have you. But don't expect us to be paying to go advertise or market it anywhere. It\u2019s working fine for us. Clearly travel is one of the best-kept secrets out there. It is huge savings, incredible positive feedback from our members and I personally hear both from people like yourselves to friends where they say they had no idea and they couldn't believe how much they saved. So we are getting better at letting people know about that stuff, but we are not going to go crazy. It works for us the way we do it and the goal is to try to keep getting you in the door because when you are in the door you are going to buy a bunch of stuff and see those garage doors and air-conditioning units as well.","Scott Mushkin","All right, perfect. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Cristina Fernandez with Telsey Advisory.","Joe Feldman","Hey, guys, it\u2019s Joe Feldman on. Thanks for taking our question. I just wanted to follow up again on the inventory. I know you commented that you did the physical inventory and everything was pretty clean. But again, this was the first quarter in like the past three or four where inventory growth did outpace sales growth and presumably some of that is the FX. But I guess I was wondering if you could talk about that a little bit, if there is any driver there, if there is any one area of the inventory that may be a little heavy?","Richard Galanti","It really is across categories, maybe a little higher in some of those categories that come by boat, shipped from Asia. By the way when the slowdown was solved, that was just the beginning of a two or three month period of catching up backlog and so bringing in some seasonal items, not having some patio furniture as an example right after \u2013 we were fine through Christmas because we like other retailers were able to get some of that stuff in a little earlier than planned.","So the good news is I think because we are in seasons early and out seasons early, we were all a little later, but we were just fine. I think \u2013 I am guessing again \u2013 we will wait and see until the fourth quarter end, but I am guessing you will see that trend reverse a little given ex-FX given that some of it had to do with that. We haven't seen any change in markdowns at all related to having a little extra inventory as these containers were catching up.","Joe Feldman","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck with this quarter.","Richard Galanti","Thanks, everyone, and have a good morning or afternoon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference.

Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","","Operator","","Good morning, my name is Tabitha and I'll be your conference operator today.  At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the fourth quarter and fiscal year-end operating results for 2012 conference call.  (Operator Instructions).  ","Thank you, Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Thank you, Tabitha, and good morning to everyone.  This morning's report as it relates to our 17-week fourth quarter and 53-week fiscal year 2012 operating results, both which ended September 2nd.  For comparison purposes, the fiscal quarter and year are compared to last year's 16-week and 52-week periods for the prior fiscal year '11.  ","As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that these discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  And that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events resulting in our performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.  The risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with SEC.  ","For the fourth quarter, to begin with, our 17-week fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 operating results.  We reported earnings of per share, of course, this morning of $1.39, up 29% from last year's reported fourth quarter earnings of $1.08.  ","Sales for the quarter were up 14%, which of course, include the extra week in Q4 of this year.  We ended at 17 weeks this year versus 16 weeks last year.  Now comparable sales, which we do compare like 17-week periods both years, were up 5% on a reported basis and up 6% excluding gas and FX.  ","Last year's fourth quarter results included a $32 million pre-tax LIFO charge that impacted last year's earnings per share by $0.04.  This year's fourth quarter results included a $11.5 million pre-tax LIFO charge impacting this year's fourth quarter earnings by $0.02 a share.","Now several other items impacting the year-over-year fourth quarter comparisons of earnings include the following.  First, the U.S. and Canada membership fee increased that took effect earlier this fiscal year.  This added approximately $26 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share in this year's fourth quarter.  ","Second, FX headwinds, earnings from our foreign operations are converted into U.S. dollars when we consolidate and report our results.  Year-over-year in the fourth quarter on average, the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar.  This resulted in roughly a $20 million pre-tax or $0.03 a share after-tax hit or impact to this year's fourth quarter.  That is assuming FX exchange rates were flat year over year, our foreign country operating results in the fourth quarter when reported in U.S. dollars would have been higher by that amount.  ","Third, our $900 million pay-down of 5.3% fixed rate debt this past March.  This reduced our interest expense comparison to year-over-year Q4 by approximately $15 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share.  ","Fourth, as reported earlier on July 9th, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership interest in our Costco Mexico operations.  The impact to our fourth quarter 2012 P&L was twofold.  First, about a $0.02 per share benefit to fourth quarter '12 for the extra earnings we now own if you will.  And second, a one-time charge of $8.3 million or $0.02 a share to our income tax line.  This related to the dividend payment from Costco Mexico to Costco U.S.  ","For the purposes of the year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter, these two items, relating to the Costco Mexico purchase, were essentially a wash to earnings.  The earning accretion from our Costco Mexico acquisition will continue through the first anniversary of the transaction or next July.  ","And finally, a fifth item of comparison, we had an extra week, of course, this year in the fourth quarter, 17 weeks versus last year's 16 weeks.  Simply dividing our fourth quarter earnings of $1.39 by 17 weeks, the positive impact to Q4 we estimate to be about $0.08 a share.  ","For the fiscal year, net income came in at $1.709 billion or $3.89 a share.  This compared to $1.46 billion or $3.30 a share in last year fiscal '11.  This net earnings were up 17% in dollars and up 18% on an earnings-per-share basis.  ","For the entire 2012 fiscal year, our LIFO charge was $20.5 million pre-tax or about a $0.03 hit to earnings.  This compares to all of fiscal 2011 when it was an $87 million charge or $0.12 hit to last year's earnings.","Lastly on the FX front, the total negative impact to this year's sales was just under $600 million in the earnings hit, if you will, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been $31 million pre-tax or $0.04 a share.","Sales for the fourth quarter, again our 17-week quarter, as like weeks, was up 5% and this included the U.S. number of up 6% and international up 2%.  Excluding gas deflation, there was an ever so slight deflation and a negative impact of FX and a sales increase \u2013 comp sales increase would be 6% for the total company as compared to the 5% reported.  The U.S. would remain unchanged at 6%, again very little impact although as minor gas deflation.  And international given the weakness in foreign currencies, international and local currencies, they reported 2% number when in instead it had been plus 7.","September sales results were reported last week on October 4th.  Briefly, for the five-weeks September reporting period, U.S. comp sales came in at 6%, international at 7%, and total company at 6%.  And again, excluding the positive impacts of gas and FX, U.S. comp sales on a normal basis if you will were up 5%, international up 6%, and total company up 5%.  For September, the average ticket increased a little over 2% while frequency in air traffic increased by about 4%.  ","Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans, we opened a total of 16 new warehouses during fiscal 2012.  And again, that quarter ended on \u2013 that fiscal year ended on September 2nd.  Of those 16, 10 were new in the U.S., 4 in Japan, and 1 each in Korea and Taiwan.  In addition, we relocated one location during all of last fiscal year in Ontario, Canada.  ","For fiscal 2013, our expansion activities include a plan for approximately 27 to 30 new locations with just under half of those in the United States and the remaining in international markets.  ","During the first four months of fiscal '13, basically September through calendar year end here, we plan to open 14 new locations; almost the same number of new locations we opened in all of last year.  Nine of these 14 will be in the U.S, three will be in Canada and one each will be in [inaudible] and Korea.  I think most recently I mentioned that we estimated 15 locations; one in Wheaton, Maryland has been delayed due to construction issues and we estimate it now to open in March or April.  ","Also this morning, I'll go over our Costco Online results and some recent activities, our membership trends, additional discussions about our operating results for the quarter, and our stock repurchase activities.","Onto the discussion for quarterly results,.  Very briefly, sales for the fourth quarter, again up 14%.  Total sales at $31.5 billion this year in the fourth quarter versus $27.6 last year.  ","For the quarter, our 5% reported comps were a result of a combination of an average frequency or traffic increase of 4.5% and a flat average transaction year-over-year.  I mentioned earlier that we all of a sudden started to see quite a bit of a weakness in foreign currencies.  That flat average transaction includes that impact, a negative impact of about 1.5% from FX.  So up a little assuming flat year-over-year FX rates.","Overall for all of fiscal '12, our average sales per warehouse for the 608 warehouses we have in operation, on an annualized basis was $154 million, up 7% from the $146 million figure in fiscal '11.  ","Moving onto sales by geography.  For the fourth quarter, the strongest comp results in the U.S. were in the Northwest and the Midwest.  All regions were fairly good and the range between the low and the high among regions was in 4% to 8% range.  ","Internationally, local currencies, Canada, Korea, and Mexico were the strongest and Japan at the weakest.  Japan mostly due to cannibalization resulting from the four new locations opened this past year in Japan.  ","In terms of E-commerce, Costco.com and Costco.ca; sales were up 14% for the quarter and up 9% for the entire year.  During the fourth quarter, as I think I mentioned, we're planning as of the last quarterly report, during the fourth quarter we launched Costco.com apps for both the Android and the Apple devices.  And three weeks ago on September 16th, we transitioned Costco.com and Costco.ca sites to its new platform.  The new platform certainly improves the visibility of the sites when using search engines and also we believe made several improvements to the sites from the end user perspective.  ","And lastly, next week we will open our new E-commerce site for the U.K., Costco.co.uk.  We go live next Monday, October 15th.  ","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, Softlines was a standout for the quarter in the high single digits.  Within Food and Sundries, comps were in the positive mid-single digits.  Hardlines produced positive comps in the single digit range as well.  Strongest sub-categories for the Hardlines were Hardware and Lawn and Garden, which were in the very high single digits.  Consumer Electronics produced positive comps in the mid-single digits.  Within the Softlines, the strongest numbers were in small electrics and domestics.  ","Lastly, all Fresh Foods comparable sales were up in the mid-to-high single digit range with the strongest results in Deli and Produce.  And on the inflation front, Food and Sundries along with Fresh Foods continued to experience inflation in that low single digit range.  ","Moving down the line items in the Income Statement, we'll start with Membership Fees.  In the fourth quarter, membership fee income was $694 million or 2.21%.  This is up 18% in dollars and up 7 basis points.  And it represents an increase of $104 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter.  ","In terms of Membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates rounding up to 90% and U.S. and Canada and worldwide, 86%.  We continue to experience increasing penetration of the executive membership.  Incremental membership from the fee increase effective last November in the U.S. and Canada benefited the quarter by an estimated $26 million.  The benefits from this will continue to show year-over-year increases throughout the four fiscal quarters of fiscal 2013 and into the first quarter of fiscal 2014.  That, of course, is based on the fact that we used deferred accounting to book those increases.  ","Our new membership sign-ups in the fourth quarter were up 2% year-over-year.  Last year in the fourth quarter, we opened 12 new locations including 4 in Asia and 2 in Australia.  Those tend to have outsized new member signups as of through opening day.  And that compares to six new openings this year in the fourth quarter, which included two in Asia.  ","In terms of the number of members at fourth quarter end, in terms of Gold Star, 26.7 million, up from 26.4 million at the end of the third quarter.  Primary business, 6.4 million both at the end of the third quarter end, fiscal year end.  Add-on business, 3.8 million at year end.  That's up a little bit from 3.6 million at third quarter end.  So total households, 36.9 million at year end, up from 36.4 million 17 weeks earlier.  And with add-on with spouse cards, 67.4 million cardholders out there from 66.5 million a quarter ago.  ","At the end of the fourth quarter, we had 12.6 million executive members, which is an increase of about 245,000 or 2% since third quarter end and that's about 14,000 new executive members per week.  Executive members, as I mentioned, represented little over a third of our member base and a little over two-thirds of our sales.","In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned earlier, they continue to be strong.  Business membership renewal rates ended the year at 93.7%.  That's up a tick from 93.6% at the third quarter end.  Gold Star, 88.7% at year end, up a tick from 88.6% at the end of the third quarter.  So total U.S. and Canada, 89.7%, up a tick from 89.6%.  And again as I mentioned, worldwide 86.4%, up from 86.2% at the end of the third quarter.  ","Based on our increasing U.S. and Canada renewal rates, we believe that the last November's renewal membership fee increase had little or no impact on our renewal rates, which continued to move higher.","In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by three basis points, coming in at 10.51% of sales this year in the fourth quarter, down from 10.54% a year earlier.  I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers.  I will have six columns basically looking at the fourth quarter and the prior two quarters.  And each of those quarters will have two columns, both reported and without gas impacts, meaning inflation in Q's two and three and a minor amount of deflation in Q4.  ","Line items would be Core Merchandising, Ancillary Businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, and Total.  So going across the Core Merchandise in Q2, reported minus-25 basis points year-over-year and without gas inflation, minus 16.  Q3, minus 21 reported and minus 14.  And Q4 minus 10 and minus -10 and basically, the Q4 columns will be the same in both columns because again, while there was minor deflation, it was minor.  It didn\u2019t even change the basis point variances.","Ancillary, minus 2 reported and plus 2 without gas \u2013 I'm sorry, let me correct that one.  For the second quarter, Ancillary was minus 5 and minus 4without gas.  For the third quarter, Ancillary was plus 7 and plus 8.  And for the fourth quarter plus 1 and plus 1.  ","2% Reward, minus 2 and minus 3 in the second quarter.  Minus 2 and minus 3 again in the third quarter.  And minus 2 and minus 2 in the fourth quarter.  LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 in the second quarter, plus 21 and plus 21 in the third quarter.  Recall that last year the third quarter we had the first sizeable amount of LIFO.  And in the fourth quarter, plus 8 and plus 8.  ","And then Total, in the second quart of \u201912 we reported gross margins down year over year of 30 basis points but without gas inflation it was minus 21.  ","In the third quarter, we reported up 5 basis points total margin.  Without gas inflation it would have been up 12.  And in the fourth quarter, both reported and without that minor amount of gas deflation, minus 3 basis points.  ","Now, I\u2019ll focus my attention on the without gas column.  Note again that in Q4 the gas really didn\u2019t have an effect anyway.  As you can see from these overall numbers, the Core Merchandising gross margin in the fourth quarter was 10 basis points lower year over year.  Actually, a small relative improvement from the minus 14 in Q3 and the minus 16 in Q2 on the year-over-year comparison.  Ancillary business gross margins contributed a small amount up 1 basis point.  Unlike prior quarters where our gas business, and again, as inflationary price trends have impacted the gross margin matrix, it didn\u2019t really do a whole lot here in the fourth quarter.  ","And the Core Merchandising categories, Food and Sundries along with Fresh Foods were slightly higher while Non-Foods categories, Hardlines and Softlines margins were a bit lower.  The 2% Reward feature of our executive membership was incrementally higher or negatively impacted gross margin by 2 basis points as I mentioned.  And again, LIFO, while we did have a charge of $11.5 million this year, that compared to a $32 million charge in the fourth quarter last year so that represented an 8-basis point improvement to our reported margin year over year.  ","We believe our margins are fine.  Our inventories are clean.  We had a great fiscal year end fiscal inventory result.  In all, as you heard from us in the past, we remain committed to driving topline sales as we enter the Christmas holiday season and into calendar 2013.  ","Moving onto SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the fourth quarter year over year were lower or better by 18 basis points coming in at 9.6% of sales for Q4 compared to 9.84% in last year\u2019s Q4.  Again, if you would jot down just a few numbers.  The same three columns, the same six columns for second and third and fourth quarters.  Operations, Core operations at Central, Equity, RSUs, and Total.  ","So again, going across, for Core Operations in the second quarter we reported an improvement or plus 25 basis points.  Plus means lower SG&A.  Without gas inflation, it was plus 18.  In the third quarter, plus 10 and plus 4.  And in the fourth quarter plus 12 and plus 13.  ","Central, in the second quarter, plus 5 and plus 4.  In the third quarter, minus 8 and minus 9.  And in the fourth quarter, plus 6 and plus 6.  ","RSUs, minus 1 and minus 1.  In the second quarter 0 and 0 and both in the third quarter and 0 and 0 in the fourth quarter. ","And then Total, for the second quarter year over year reported SG&A lower or plus 29 basis point, without gas plus 21.  In the third quarter, plus 2 and minus 5.  And in the fourth quarter, plus 18 and there has been a rounding to plus 19.  So again, that\u2019s the matrix that I\u2019ll talk about.  ","In terms of an editorial here, again, Operations were lower or better by 12 basis points year over year as reported, excluding the negative impact of very slight deflation in gasoline, the Core was actually better by 13.  Within Core Operations, our payroll as a percentage of sales improved year over year in the fourth quarter by 6 basis points with a 2-basis-point offset to the healthcare cost lines.  ","Our Central Expenses were better year over year, or lower by 6 basis points.  This is notwithstanding higher year-over-year IT costs related to our IT modernization efforts of our systems that we have embarked on.  So overall, a continued focus, I think, on expense reduction or expense improvement and we think that was evident in the fourth quarter.  ","On the income \u2013 I will make one other comment.  On the income statement, in terms of formatting, you may note or you probably haven\u2019t noted yet,  that we have combined our former income statement line item provision for repaired assets and closing costs within SG&A because of it\u2019s an immaterial amount.  I will mention that in the fourth quarter of \u201911 we had a charge of $2 million in the quarter on that line so that\u2019s added SG&A and in Q4 \u201912, that we had a minor charge of a few hundred thousand dollars.  So both minor and historically very minor and will reclassify accordingly.  ","In terms of factors that will impact SG&A in \u201913, the main items will continue to be sales trends, healthcare costs and gasoline sales and inflation in terms of percentages and increasing penetration of certain international operations, which have overall \u2013 which generally have lower overall SG&A percentages.  ","In terms of the next line item, Pre-Opening expenses, Pre-Opening expenses were $22 million last year in the quarter as compared to $15 million this year.  So $7 million lower or 3 basis points better.  Note, as I mentioned earlier, last year we had 12 openings in the quarter compared to 6 this year.  All totaled operating income in the fourth quarter as up just under 25% year over year from $762 million last year in the quarter to $9 million this year, an increase of $187 million.  Again, this includes the benefit of the extra week and the other items mentioned earlier.  ","In terms of interest and other, below the operating income line, we reported interest expense was lower year over year by $14 million with Q4 \u201912 coming in at $22 million versus 36 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.  These amounts, again, may reflect the interest expense on the \u2013 no the previously $2 billion offering of [inaudible] of \u201907, $900 million of that, of course, on March, this past March 15th was paid off.  And again, the anticipated pre-tax interest savings given that we\u2019re essentially paying off 5-plus percent in debt and [inaudible] on cash that\u2019s earing sub-50 basis points ,that\u2019s around $46 million pre-tax a year.  For the fourth quarter this represented a reduction in interest expense of 15 million and again, on an annual basis about $46 million.  ","In terms of interest income and other it was lower year over year by 8 million, coming in at 38 million this year in the quarter versus 46 million last year.  It was lower year over year largely due to the income last year in the fourth quarter related to gains on non-functional currencies held by certain of our foreign operations.  Primarily this represented the U.S. dollars that were being held in Costco Mexico, which of course in Mexico, they\u2019re a non-functional currency.  ","Historically, we\u2019d always \u2013 we and our partner had always kept a portion of our cash expressed in dollars and again, we benefited from that even though we [inaudible] peso during this period of time.  ","Overall, reported pre-tax income is up 25% from $772 million last year to $965 million this year.  Tax rate, our company\u2019s reported tax rate this quarter came at a 35.6%.  This is about 30 basis points higher than last year\u2019s fourth quarter rate of 35.3.  The income tax recorded due to the Costco Mexico dividend or the $8.3 million amount accounted for about 85 basis points of our fourth quarter 2012 tax rate and this was offset by year-over-year \u2013 well, this was offset year-over-year by increasing earnings attributed to our foreign operations, again, which generally had a lower rate.  ","Now for a  quick rundown of a few other items.  The balance sheet was included in the press release this morning.  Some of you have asked me for the depreciation and amortization in the fourth quarter.  For the quarter, it was $292 million which then for the year was $908 million.  We always look at our accounts payable ratios.  On the balance sheet it shows an improvement from 99% APS as percent of inventory last year to 103%.  A big chunk of that difference there would be the payables on non-merchandise payables given all the construction activates we have going on.  ","So if we take out that and look at just merchandising payables and merchandising inventories, it was about the same year over year, 91% last year and 90% this year at quarter end.  Average inventory per warehouse was up $458,000 or about 4% from last year\u2019s \u2013 our fourth quarter end our average inventory per warehouse was $11.2 million and this year, $11.67 million. ","Electronics was about half of that, a little over half of that, $240,000 as we\u2019ve been experiencing improving sales in that department.  As you know, we continue to focus on the bigger-ticket items, you know, selling lots of things like 60 and 80-inch TVs.  The remaining balance of variance is spread over many departments.  Again, good inventory showing [inaudible] and good fiscal yearend inventory results.  ","In terms of CapEx, the fourth quarter, we spent $580 million and for all of 2012 just a shade under $1.5 billion.  In fiscal \u201913, our CapEx is actually [inaudible] quite a bit given the increase level of new openings as well as investments in operations and infrastructure such as depots in both Japan and Taiwan along with increased investment in IT related to our systems modernization projects that I had mentioned earlier.  ","Our current estimate for CapEx in fiscal 2013 compared \u2013 as compared to the 1.5 billion last year is somewhere in the range of 1.8 to $2 billion.  In terms of our dividend earlier in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 14.5% from $0.24 per share or $0.96 per share on an annual basis, to $0.275 per share per quarter or $1.10 a share annualized.  This dividend \u2013 this annualized dividend now represents a total cost to the company of just about $488 million.  ","And in terms of expansion, quarter we expect to open 9 warehouses in the first quarter, which is late November and an additional 6 in the second quarter, most of which is before \u2013 all but one which I believe is before calendar year end.  In the third quarter, which stretches from roughly mid-February to roughly mid-May 7, and fourth quarter, the 16 weeks from roughly mid-May to the end of August 8.  That would bring us to 30 for the year.  That\u2019s the budget, as I mentioned earlier.  We\u2019re talking about 27 to 30 and inevitably there\u2019s always a few that fall out, but I\u2019m happy to report that we have a lot going on between now and calendar year end.  ","Assuming we added 30 on a base of 608, that would be about a 5% square footage growth, which would certainly be our largest square footage expansion in years.  Also as a fiscal year end, our total square footage was 86 million ,937,000 square feet.  In terms of our stock repurchases, for the year we purchased 7.3 million shares at an average price of $84.75 bringing total expenditures over the last several years \u2013 over the entire fiscal year to 617 million, which I believe is about the same as \u2013 roughly the same, within 10 or $20 million of the amount we spent in 2011.  ","With that, as always, we\u2019ll have a supplemental information packet and that will posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning.  And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Tabitha for Q&A.  Thank you.  ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","(Operator instructions).

Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Hi.","John Heinbocket \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Regarding inflation, when do you expect to see vendor price increases, and what magnitude are the company\u2019s buyers talking about?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Well this is very general, I mean, probably the standout area are things like protein. You know, pork, beef, and poultry. And the anticipation is over the next several months given some of the issues with wheat and corn, that that will continue to go up. Some of the bakery raw materials for the same reasons will go up, and they\u2019re still talking in the mid-field digit or a little higher range, but that\u2019s the guess at this point. I don\u2019t hear a lot on the other areas. In fact in just our first month if you will of this fiscal year in September, we saw essentially company wide, as reflected through the LIFO calculation of almost exactly flat. I mean one basis point of inflation. And there was a little bit, you know again, well less than half a percentage point in the Food and Sundries categories and a little bit of deflation in things like apparel and electronics.  And again, the apparel has more to do, I think, with \u2013 some of those prices are down from a year ago when they were quite high, and still higher than a few years ago. So, if you add it all up, modest inflation is the expectation with it being geared more towards some of the fresh food items, and raw material food ingredients.","John Heinbocket \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","I guess about handling you past through, do you guys expect to pass everything through, or?  I think you said the margin on Food and Sundries was up for the quarter, right?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Yes. Look sometimes we do and sometimes we don\u2019t. Generally speaking things like, you know, refrigerated fresh food, you know meat, and things like that, those prices change daily and weekly and the input costs change daily and weekly, in some cases, and the sales prices. We like everyone in the fresh food business are price checking out competition and adjusting accordingly.  As you know from history, that there are times when we\u2019re not going to change the cold of a sixteen pack of muffins or the cost of a slice of pizza when cheese went up, but generally speaking there\u2019s not those out-sized areas.  ","Now that being said, also things like fresh meat are very competitive, and you know we\u2019re out there where we can gain a little strength in that area, as the higher end cuts of beef and some of the organic aspects of beef where we can show a greater savings and make a little better margin.  But those are still small percentages of the total sales.","John Heinbocket \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Okay, and then just looking at expansion of the longer term, obviously 27 to 30, as you said is the largest you guys have done. But what would you say the principle bottleneck, when it comes to club expansion, when you get to that high upper 20s range, and what would you say is your maximum amount of clubs to add within a year, that you can execute at a high level?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Well, I mean, as you know been hands on, and I\u2019m guessing operationally that the clubs we do  we can easily handle 30, the challenges operationally. The bottleneck really has been ourselves in terms of, ","One: It takes a little longer to find and develop sites in some of these foreign countries like Asia, and subject to other appeal processes. There\u2019s some countries where the competitors can appeal you just to appeal you and slow you down, which isn\u2019t very nice. But at the end of the day, you know, I think we\u2019ve got a lot more in the pipeline finally.  We have more people devoted to real estate, we have on the ground physically in I believe every country over the last couple of years, and so again, the pipeline is more filled and I think that\u2019s evidenced in the amount that we are doing some of these countries where it does take longer like some of the Asian countries, Australia and the like.  So, I think the bigger bottleneck was us, and it\u2019s finally picking up a little bit.","John Heinbocket \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC"," ","All right, thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank.

Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Hi.","","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research","I want to go through a couple of things with you to start with on the fuel. Could you talk about how profitable fuel was in the quarter and what the comp-gallons groups were?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Well I think, first the profitability we never talked about how profitable it is. We talked about how it is year-over-year when there\u2019s outsize changes to it, because it can fluctuate quite a bit. Actually on a quarter-over-quarter basis, year-over-year it was pretty, less than a penny I think of difference, so really nothing to speak of there. As you know when prices are going down, profits are up and there was some of that both this fiscal quarter, as well as in the fourth quarter of last year, so both quarters had some pretty good profits year-over-year.","And in terms of Chuck the other question was? ","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research"," ","Fuel comparable gallons?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Yes the comp-gallons in the fourth quarter are 6%, and that compares to 8% in Q3, and quite a bit more in September for whatever reasons. I guess because prices were going back up. That\u2019s it.","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research","Excuse me, at the end of the fiscal year what was your square footage.","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Let\u2019s see here, it was 86,937. [inaudible]","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research","When you are looking at the nice performance you had Richard in the fourth quarter, what elements of the gross profit margin and the SG&A, especially the SG&A improvement do you think are sustainable into the new year?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","Well I think the easiest sustainable things for the next few quarters are those things that we\u2019ve done like the debt pay down, the Mexior acquisition, and the membership fee increase and how that affects the [inaudible].  So all those things, you know they\u2019re permanent for a year, they continue for a year and then it\u2019s part of the base.","Beyond that, I mean, I think that the sales drive \u2013 you know, you\u2019ve always heard from us that were a topline company, certainly our relative sales strength has helped us here. I think the focus on little things \u2013 I\u2019ve thrown out some examples over the last months and quarters about the past year one of the [inaudible] items is overtime hours, and I think we showed for the first 40 or so weeks of the fiscal year at one of our budget meetings that aggregate hours were up 3 \u00bd or so percent year for the year. Overtime hours were down 25%. You know, not a lot of money maybe 10-15 million dollars a year, but it\u2019s real. And maybe it goes over \u2013 maybe you don\u2019t get it all in the first year, you get over a couple of years. But those are the kinds of things that we see out there. Is that sustainable? I mean what\u2019s sustainable is our efforts to do it.","I think on the margin side, as I\u2019ve said in the past, it\u2019s more us than them, whoever them is, when we\u2019re competing with them. We tend to be proactive in it, we\u2019ve been asked about the question now that some of the quote [inaudible] price is starting (the anniversary) from when it was being discussed a year ago. Does that mean it\u2019s over, or there\u2019s more of it, again we don\u2019t talk about that.  I can assure you that when things are good we\u2019re going to continue to do things to drive the business.","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research","All right thanks. A couple of more things Richard, do you a full year fuel sales figure that you can give us at this time, and can you comment on what the spike in retail gasoline prices in California on the fuel prices there, what\u2019s that doing to traffic and gasoline sales?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","I don\u2019t have anything specific on the total dollars. I think for the year it was like 12 or so percent of sales. The craziness in California had to do with all the moons lined up bad, and there was several days there of incredible supply shortage. As you would expect we are a major consumer in the greater L\/A market, we have close to 40 locations, and at the peak or at the trough I guess we had 16 or so of those stations closed for one or two days. Happily that ended, I believe this Sunday and we\u2019re back to normal generally. The impact to us was, again it did get people \u2013 my sense was, what I heard was is that it was a little bit of the concern that there\u2019s gas shortage everywhere and people were topping off their tanks, so it created more volume. We saw a little bump in sales at those locations in store. But we were also in some cases losing money at the gas pump. So my guess is it wasn\u2019t a big impact to us, and to bottom line we lose money no doubt in gas and made money with extra cars in the parking lot coming to get gas. It\u2019s really a blip for a few days in California, Southern California.","Charles E. Cerankosky \u2013 North Coast Research","Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig (Nathan Rich) \u2013 Citi.","Deborah Weinswig (Nathan Rich) \u2013 Citi","","Hi Richard, this is Nathan Rich filling in for Deb today. I wanted to go back to the decision that you guys made to accelerate club growth.  I was just wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail on where the international expansion is going to come, in terms of what markets are focused on, and also are there any new markets internationally?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","","Well the markets \u2013 in Canada we opened a couple of three a year, maybe sometimes one, maybe three, but probably two to three on average. In Mexico we\u2019ll probably speed it up a little. Over the last five years I think we\u2019ve opened two locations, so 0.4 locations a year historically over the last five years. You know it\u2019s going to take a little time here, but you know, I would expect that to grow at least two or three years starting after this year.  We have one or two in the U.K. this year after a few years of no growth. But the big expansion for us continues to be in the three Asian countries where we\u2019re at, Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, and Australia. Now all those countries take a little longer because of the complexity, these are building up not out, you know multi-floors and it takes a little longer. But again, we had the pipeline full.","The only other things we talked about is Europe and I can\u2019t \u2013 we are pursuing in a couple of Western European countries, and if all goes well maybe five years from now we\u2019ll have a few locations opened in each, but I cannot tell you whether it\u2019s going to be, you know twelve months or thirty months before we have our first opening in any country over there. ","Deborah Weinswig (Nathan Rich) \u2013 Citi","Great, and then also if I could a question. It seems like you saw some improvement in food margins, both Food and Sundries and fresh foods.  Those have been trending flat to down over the past several quarters. I was just wondering what caused the change in trend this quarter?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","You know without looking deep into it, my guess is some of it has to do with the fact that it was a year ago when we were explaining there was some anecdotal comments I made probably about the fact that we maintained pricing on some highly inflationary cost items like: The food court with cheese pizza, like the bakery. So part of that I think is just the cycling of perhaps some unusual things the other way. I think a little of it, not a lot of it, but a little of it, has to do with increasing penetration in some fresh foods with the KS, the Kirkland Signature name. Some of it has to do with the comment I mentioned earlier about organic. These are small things, but there\u2019s more and more of them. If we can take 20 or 30 million dollars out of a few hundred million dollars a year of ground beef sales from a highly competitive basic ground beef line, and put it into organic, that\u2019s good for us because we can sell it, because we have that kind of member. It\u2019s good for us because that member sees \u2013 let\u2019s just say a higher price point item, but the member sees an even greater relative value because those are the items that are as competitive out there. So we can provide the customer more and do more. So all those things I think add up.","Deborah Weinswig (Nathan Rich) \u2013 Citi","Okay great. Then just lastly if I could, I\u2019m interested to hear what you\u2019re seeing in terms of early selling for fall and holiday, and if you could comment on TVs in particular, which I think have been pretty good for you recently?","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EV and Director","On the latter, the TVs have been strong the last couple of months that we reported. In large part I think because we focused on the higher end, or the bigger ticket size. And we have a lot of TV strength if you will, in the 60 to 80-inch TV, so the bigger we do \u2013 we do a little better on those.","On seasonal, again it\u2019s still early, so far so good. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been anything outlandish, plus or minus in hearing from the buyers in the last month or budget meetings."," We\u2019ll have a little more collar at the end of October, which is really the more meaningful month.","Deborah Weinswig (Nathan Rich) \u2013 Citi","","Great, thanks so much and best of luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group.","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, Richard.  I was just going to ask you, on the inflation side, you know, you mentioned sort of a low-single digit increase this quarter for Food and Sundries.  If you looked across the box, you know, can you just give us a feel for that?  Are we talking 1 to 2% range across the store right now?  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","Well, low tenth of a single digit.  It\u2019s closer to 1, so not a whole lot.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","And that\u2019s across the store?  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","It\u2019s all over the board.  I mean, I was looking just at some items, I mean, these are, you know, again, these are anecdotal items, but you know, year over year eggs are up 22%.  I\u2019m looking down the list here.  Blueberries up 37% year over year.  Conversely, you\u2019ve got items, always you\u2019re going to have some electronic items, but beyond electronic items, I can\u2019t tell you why, back is down 17%.  Gasoline down a couple of percent.  So it\u2019s all over the board, but overall, when you think of a whole basket of things, up very little for the month.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","And then just thinking about moving forward if you could see any single-digit type inflation on the food side, again, does that translate across the store to something, again, that\u2019s maybe a couple 100 bits less than that just given the other categories? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Not necessarily.  First of all, there\u2019s no \u2013 when we talk about mid-single digit inflation, I was really talking about things like your expectations that our buyers have for things like meat and poultry and pork, which again, are more in the extreme inflation categories in terms of talking amongst the buyers.  Again, Food overall is by no means that level and then, of course, as I mentioned, there\u2019s a few things that are ever so slightly deflation right now like apparel and electronics.  ","So really there\u2019s no \u2013 and I guess the inflation is going to be very, very low single digits this year as we know of today.  Life could change tomorrow.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","And then just maybe for a minute on the competitive set, are you seeing anything that\u2019s noteworthy versus this time last year in terms of how your club competitors are pricing or traditional grocers out there? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Not really.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay. Just one housekeeping thing is on the FX impact for membership income, I was getting to around the $7 million impact roughly.  Does that makes sense to you? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","I think \u2013 hold on a second.  I think that\u2019s close.  ","Unidentified Male","","That\u2019s correct. ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","$8 million.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","$8 million, okay, great.  And then just lastly with the new store openings accelerating and trying to go a bit more international in terms of the mix there, is it possible, Richard, to give us just an understanding a little bit of the pre-opening expense for International versus the U.S. origin and also on the CapEx side, given the step up, is there a way to bucketize that in terms of X amount goes towards IT versus new stores?  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","You know, it has more to do \u2013 International, generally, is more and you know, it could be \u2013 and these are, you know, if you were [inaudible], there\u2019s other things put into openings too, like when we add a gas station or we open a depot or a \u2013 all those kinds of things.  So you know, generally speaking, now remember, this goes back several years, but it used to be like a U.S. warehouse was a million, plus or minus a little and an International, I say International outside of North America might has been as much as 1.5 million or 1.75, but those are guesses.  Yes, it\u2019s more in some of those countries but you know, a big chunk of pre-opening is not just the \u2013 you can\u2019t just take the pre-opening divided by the number of warehouses and that\u2019s the average for the warehouse because you have a lot of other pre-openings.  Every time we add a gas station, that\u2019s\u2019 going to \u2013 it\u2019s a new operation.  You know, we\u2019ve done it consistently from day one, but there\u2019s a lot of other things in there as well.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","And just on the CapEx side of the ball, Richard? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","What\u2019s that? ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","On the CapEx side as well in terms of the cost for warehouse, domestic versus International?  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","It\u2019s probably 20 to 30% more on average, sometimes \u2013 there will be some wide ranges.  I mean, I think we say in the U.S. generally that land, building and site we own is somewhere in the low-to-mid 30s.  My guess is overseas it could be in the low-40s on average, but it could range from mid-30s to high-50s, all over the board.  But you know, as you know, some of those higher numbers, we can get a better return on investment. ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","And maybe just the last thing if I could ask it is, Affordable Care Act and what you all are hearing right now in doing the prepare for that.  Is there anything you can share in terms of the percentage for your employees that would be covered today or the percentage of the coverage that you all provide or anything that would be helpful? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","I think we provide as much if not more than anybody else I know in our space, in general retail.  All of our employees, both part time and full time are covered.  It takes three to six months currently, depending on if you\u2019re part time or full time.  Each year for the last two or three years and certainly this year and next year under different parts of the new Healthcare requirements, there\u2019s been some additional input numbers into our expense.  You know, one year it\u2019s covering people to 26 years old.  One year it\u2019s mental health.  One year it\u2019s \u2013 I forget the other ones off the top of my head.  But at the end of the day, each of these things need to have added an incremental 1 or 1.5% to our already outsized number.  ","So we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a big impact to us like it may to others but you know, others may do some things that may be less of an impact to them.  I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s fair to say from our perspective, it\u2019s kind of been built into our numbers and we\u2019ve been able to handle it.  ","Michael Montani \u2013 ISI Group","Great.  That\u2019s very helpful.  Thank you and good luck. ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Thank you. ","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert W. Baird.  ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Hey, Richard.  It\u2019s actually Justin for Pete.  Just a question on the membership fee income.  Can you help us understand how much that line item benefited for the extra week? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","I think the simplest way to do it, and this is not exact, but I first take this number this year and subtract the 26 from it because we know the 26 is the [inaudible] accounting for the free increases.  And from that number, I\u2019d say, okay, this is 17 \u2013 I\u2019m very sorry, divided by 17 and I\u2019d subtract that amount from that number and then I compare the two.  The adjusted number, and I think what you get is something in the 6 or 7% increase change in dollars.  ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  Thanks.  And then the $26 million of incremental MFI from the fee increase that you cited here in the fourth quarter, did that absolute dollar number \u2013 should we expect that to build over the next few quarters? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Yes.  And It will build \u2013 well, it will build a little bit into Q1, recognizing Q1 is a 12-week quarter versus a 17-week quarter, so the absolute dollars will be a little low.  It will build quite a little bit more in Q2.  It will build \u2013 and then it will start going the other way, but still pretty sizable numbers in each of these four fiscal quarters.  It\u2019s $0.03 to $0.05 per quarter in each of these quarters.  ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Okay. Thanks.  And just any color on as it relates to traffic conversion rates, average ticket size from the replatforming of the online business or is it just simply too early to tell with that? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Yes, it\u2019s very simply too early.  It\u2019s only been a week or so and the thing I\u2019m most happy about is there weren\u2019t any big glitches and we got it converted in about an 8-hour period, closing the old site and opening the new one.  So we\u2019ll see over time.  ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","Great.  Just lastly, a housekeeping question here.  In that interest income and other line item, do you have what the interest component of that was? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Sure.  Hold on.  Actual interest income was 14- almost $15 million last year and $16.3 this year. So up 1.3 million. ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","All right.  Great.  Thanks.  Good luck over the holidays. ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Yep. ","Peter S. Benedict (Justin) \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co. ","","Thank you","Operator","","(Operator instructions).  Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank. ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks.  Just on the \u2013 the new store growth going up to 25 to 30 clubs, should we expect that pace to continue to grow over the next few years?  And it\u2019s been a while since I heard you guys talk about a longer-term club target, but you know, with growth in Europe, Australia, more growth in Korea, Japan and Taiwan.  Can you maybe refresh us in kind of where it your thoughts are? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Well, you know, given our history over the last several years of under-opening locations.  I think we feel very good about this coming year that, that very high 20s and you know, we\u2019re looking at numbers, we had a slide recently that showed over five years somewhere in the 125 to 150 locations, which we\u2019ve implied 25 to 30 a year.  Europe, again, if all goes well, maybe we\u2019ll have, you know, five years from now five or six in Europe or eight on the outside, but more likely five or six.  That\u2019s if it continues to progress.  There\u2019s still a few hurdles to get over there in terms of timing.  We will be there is my sense but it will take some time.  So I think, again, part of the, as I mentioned earlier, part of the \u2013 perhaps the reduced level of confidence that we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot more irons in the fire and particularly in those countries where the lead time to get openings done, you\u2019ve got to work on more projects to get more opened and even thought it takes longer, again, for the last year or two, we\u2019ve had people on the ground in some of these countries where historically we didn\u2019t.  ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, fair enough.  And then when we look at the complexion of your margin structure here in the fourth quarter, you know, gross profit margins are down a little bit, but SG&A levered to produce some pretty nice operating margin expansion of about 19 basis points.  When you take a step back and look at your kind of long-term earnings algorithm, is that sort of a good recipe for success for you guys?  Is that the kind of structure you kind of want to build out?  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Well, you know, in the ideal world, as I think Ken said, 25 years ago, that we \u2013 some things \u2013 you know, we\u2019d accelerate the membership fee, it would be a lot higher.  We\u2019d keep lowering expense percentages and we keep lowering prices.  But you know, ideally, yes, we want to keep doing that because it makes us more competitive and keeps driving the business and puts a bigger wedge in between us and others.  But we\u2019re also realistic.  But yeah, that\u2019s \u2013 mission wise, that\u2019s fair.  ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay.  And then my last question is, you know, I wasn\u2019t going to ask this on the call but you guys really continue to build up cash on the balance sheet and we get a lot of questions from investors about what you\u2019re going to do with it.  And I realize, you know, buybacks are a steady pace for you guys but is there any thoughts from the Board to really step up the dividend?  It\u2019s a lot lower than some of your peers despite having a much stronger cash and an overall balance sheet position.  ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Well, I mean, you know, yield wise it is.  You know, we continue to whatever, 13 or 14% a year.  We always discuss it informally about what should we do, but there\u2019s not a great sense of pressure to change or MO at this point.  Probably the biggest pressure point is to spend more money on CapEx.  I\u2019m glad to see the fact that it\u2019s a number that went from the range of 1.4ish in the last few years to approaching 2 this year.  I think that you know, and 14, if we continue to spend like we are, maybe it\u2019s about the same as this current year\u2019s budget.  If it\u2019s a little less it\u2019s only because of some of the unusual things we\u2019re doing this year like a couple of extra depots in some of these new counties.  So but overall, you know, getting that number up 400, 500 million from where it\u2019s been, that helps.  ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Got you . And then, I\u2019m sorry, I did hop on a couple minutes late, but could you just remind me what the quarter-on-quarter profit number margins was, this quarter and then if you go off through some of the categories within that outside of gas, I\u2019d appreciate it.  Thanks.","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Sure.  In terms of margins, for the quarter, the quarter was down 10 basis points year over year and the \u2013 with our without gas is the same.  There was minor gas deflation but not enough to affect the basis points.  So clothes was down 10, ancillary was down 1, 2% was down [inaudible] about a 1% increase in sale translation of those numbers.  LIFO was up 8 because of the lower charge this year versus last year.  You add it all up and that\u2019s our reported as adjusted with gas minus 3. ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","","And then within that core, the 10, any major differences between the other four major subcategories? ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Yeah, Food, Sundries and Fresh Foods were up a little.  Hardlines and Softlines were down a little, a bit more than a little, but not a lot.  ","Charles X. Grom \u2013 Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, thank you. ","Richard A. Galanti \u2013 CFO, EVP and Director","","Thank you.  ","Operator","","Thank you.  That ends our conference call for today.  "],"5966":["Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) F2Q2013 Results Earnings Call March 12, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - CFO","Analysts","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan","Mark Miller - William Blair","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell","Bob Drbul - Barclays","Operator","At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter FY13 operating results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. This morning\u2019s release, of course, reviews our second quarter and fiscal first half 2013 operating results for the period that ended on February 17.","As with every call, let me start by stating that these discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","So to begin with, our 12-week second quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.24, up 38% from last year\u2019s $0.90 reported number. As noted in this morning\u2019s release, and as I had mentioned during our first quarter earnings call back on December 12, this quarter\u2019s net income was positively impacted by a $62 million, or $0.14 per share, income tax benefit that was in connection with that portion of the special cash dividend paid by the company in December of 2012 to company 401k plan participants. Excluding this one-time benefit, earnings per share for the quarter would have been $1.10, or up 22% year over year.","In terms of sales for the second quarter, total sales were up 8%, and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 5%. For the quarter, sales were very slightly benefitted by gasoline inflation, less than 10 basis points of impact, and were also benefited by strong foreign currency overall relative to the U.S. dollar year over year. Probably net it added about 60 basis points.","Even so, the 5% U.S. comp sales, excluding the gas inflation, remained at 5%, and while the reported 6% international comp figure, assuming flat year over year FX rates, would have been 4%. Total company comps were reported at 5%. Excluding both gas and FX, they still came out to 5% for the company overall.","And, as announced last week, for our four-week month of February, which of course includes the last two weeks of fiscal Q2, and the first two weeks of our fiscal Q3, but in terms of the four-week month of February, comps came in at 6%, both for the U.S. and the total company.","In terms of new openings, after opening nine new locations in the first quarter, which ended November 25, we opened five new locations in the second quarter, one in Washington, DC, two in Canada, one in Oshawa, which is in the Toronto market of Ontario, and one in Drummondville, which is in the Montreal market in Quebec.","We also opened in Leicester, UK, in central England, and [Gwangmyeong], which is outside of Seoul, Korea. All told, that puts our 2013 fiscal year openings through the second quarter end at 14 new locations, such that we now operate 622 locations around the world.","Between now and the end of fiscal 13, which I think ends on September 1, we expect to open an additional 14 locations, five in the current fiscal quarter and nine in the fourth quarter. Of these 14, before fiscal year end, that we haven\u2019t opened yet, four will be in the U.S., five will be in Japan, two in the U.K., and one each in Taiwan, Australia, and Mexico, such that we will most likely end the fiscal year with 28 new openings this fiscal year and be operating a total of 636 Costcos worldwide at that time. I\u2019ll also talk later in the call about ecommerce, membership trends, and [discussions], of course, about margin and SG&A.","Onto the quarter itself, again, sales were up 8%, comps were up 5%. In terms of the reported 5% comp number, that was the product of an average transaction increase of a lot of 2% for the quarter and an average frequency increase of a lot of 3%. The frequency trend for the last three calendar months reported was 5%, 3%, and 4% for December, January, and February, and year to date we are at 4%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, overall the southeast, Texas, and Midwest regions were the strongest. Internationally, in local currencies, Korea and Japan were the weakest, again mostly due to the cannibalization on a relatively small basis, of existing units, and with Canada and Mexico being the strongest internationally, in local currency.","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the second quarter, within food and sundries, overall in the mid-single digits. Frozen foods, candy, and deli were the relative standouts. In hard lines, overall in the low single digits. Departments with the strongest results were hardware, patio and garden, lawn and garden, and tires.","Consumer electronics sales were slightly negative, mostly due to the timing of the fiscal calendar, as the typically strong Black Friday sales around Thanksgiving benefited Q2 last year and benefited Q1 this year. And you take that out, and those numbers would have been a little better.","Within the higher single digit soft lines comps, small electrics, domestics, and jewelry were standouts, with media of course continuing to be the relatively weak area. And in fresh foods, comps in the mid singles, deli and produce were a little better than the two other large categories.","Moving on to the other line items, membership fees, we came in at $528 million, or 2.17% of sales. That\u2019s up 15% in dollars, or up $69 million from the $459 million last year and up 13 basis points. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, and I\u2019ll go through that a little bit in a minute. Continued increasing penetration of the Executive membership, which is the roughly $110 a year fee.","And we\u2019re still, of course, benefitting from the $5 and $10 membership fee increases that began a lot of a year ago in both the U.S. and Canada. And of the $69 million increase year over year in membership fees, right at a half of it, or about $35 million, was due to the fee increase.","Membership fee income, as I talked about in the last few quarters, based on the deferred accounting nature of those increases and recognizing the increases occurred over a 12-month period, based on when somebody originally signed up, and then the income comes in over the succeeding 12 months of that first increase. Basically, we\u2019ll continue to show year over year benefits from that fee increase throughout fiscal 13 and to a lesser extent into the first quarter of fiscal \u201914 this coming fall. Again, that\u2019s due to the deferred accounting treatment for membership fee income.","New membership signups in Q2 company-wide were up about 1%. There were more locations open this quarter, five versus last year\u2019s two. It\u2019s mostly reflective of the very strong signups we had internationally, most particularly in Australia and Asia. Last year, we opened two units in Japan during the quarter, and two right at the end of the quarter, in the first few days of Q3. Of the 14 units opened thus far this fiscal year, only one of them has been in Asia. And again, we have pretty much oversized signups in some of those new units.","In terms of number of members at Q2 end, Gold Star: 27.8 million from 27.3 million at Q1 end, primary business remained at 6.5 million, business add-on went from 3.6 down to 3.5. Again, that\u2019s somewhat reflective, I believe, of people as they switch into their own membership as an Executive member. All told, total members went from 37.4 million at the end of the first quarter to 37.9 million, and including extra cards, spouse cards, 68.2 million went to 69.1 million at Q2 end.","At Q2 end, paid Executives were a shade over 13 million, an increase of 181,000 over the last 12 weeks, or about 15,000 new Executive members. That\u2019s both new members and conversions from the base Gold Star membership. Executive members are approximately a third of our membership base, and a little over two-thirds of our sales.","In terms of renewal rates, they\u2019ve continued to tweak up. In the U.S. and Canada, which is a little over 80% of our total company, and certainly the oldest and most mature part of our company, business renewals, which ended the fiscal year at a 93.7% rate, and at the end of the first quarter was 93.8%, are now at 93.9%. And Gold Star, which was 88.7% and remained there at the end of Q1, was 88.8. That total U.S. and Canada went from an 89.7% essentially to an 89.8% over the last quarter.","And worldwide, recognizing in newer markets you start off with lower renewal rates anyway, we went from an 86.4% at year-end, remained there at the end of the first quarter, and it tweaked up to an 86.5%. So really, over the last year, since the fee increases, we\u2019ve always been asked a lot about renewal rates. Basically, each quarter have been either the same as the prior quarter or slightly up, and they\u2019ve continue to tweak up almost a full percentage point in the last year and a quarter.","Going down the gross margin line, reported margins were up 6 basis points from a 10.53% to a 10.59%. Here we get to write down a few numbers. A little chart with five line items and four columns. Basically, we\u2019ll do two columns for each of Q1 and Q2, and of course those of you who have heard this before, this relates to the fact of how many basis points of margin reduction or improvement come on a year over year basis in the comparison. And once we do the chart, I\u2019ll give you a couple of comments.","In terms of core merchandising, reported in Q1 was -7 basis points year over year, and without gas inflation, it was -1. Going across that line, it was 0 and 0 Q2, reported and without gas inflation. On ancillary business, the second line item,+14 and +15 in the Q1 columns,+2 and +3 in the Q2 columns. 2% rewards, -2 and -3 in the Q1 columns, and -1 and -1 in the Q2 columns. LIFO,+1 and +1 in the Q1 columns, and +5 and +5. And lastly, total reported Q1 was a +6, which would be the sum of column one. That\u2019s what we reported in Q1 year over year margins. Without gas inflation, it adds up to a +12. And then of course, for Q2 reported, as I just mentioned, we were up 6 basis points, which would be that third column summation, and without gas inflation +7, recognizing there was very little gas inflation.","Basically, again, core margins were basically flat year over year. Those are the four core businesses, food and sundries, hard line and soft lines and fresh foods, which is a big piece of our business. Basically, not a bad showing. If you look back, of course as you know, of the four quarters of fiscal \u201912, on average, compared to fiscal \u201911, those numbers were minus 13 without gas inflation. And the trend in Q1 year over year was -1, and of course now it\u2019s zero year over year.","Secondly, ancillary businesses. You\u2019ll note that in Q1 it was 15 year over year. A big chunk of that, as I mentioned in the first quarter call, was strong gas margins year over year and some inflation. I think I said in the first quarter call about two-thirds of that, plus 15, related to that. In Q2, gas reversed, as gas prices went up, margins go down. As cost of gas goes up, we make less, and that plus three reflects strong ancillary business margins offset by probably five or six basis points of negative related to gas.","Two percent reward is simply a reflection of a little higher sales penetrations to those earning the 2% reward. And LIFO was a plus 5. Again, that\u2019s a LIFO credit, I\u2019ll mention in a minute, is about $9 million of a credit versus a $2.5 billion LIFO charge in the same fiscal quarter a year ago.","Mind you, when LIFO is a positive, it means the cost of the merchandise is coming down, and as you might expect, we tend to reflect that in our sales price as well, which would be on the merchandise margin line.","For the second quarter, year over year, food and sundries gross margins were flat. Hard lines and soft lines were up, and fresh foods was lower. As I mentioned on ancillary, overall, the target you saw was a +3 without gas inflation. Again, all the other ones, pharmacy, optical, hearing aids, food courts, were all up during the quarter, offset by what I just mentioned about gasoline.","The impact of the membership on executive member I already mentioned, and LIFO I mentioned as well.","Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentage second quarter year over year was slightly higher or worse by 2 basis points coming in at 970 versus 968. Again, we\u2019ll write down four columns. The same four columns, two for Q1, reported and without gas, and then two for Q2. And the five line items would be core operations; central; RSUs, which would be stock compensation; quarterly adjustments; and total.","Going across, in Q1 the two columns were +10 basis points and +5, meaning, plus means good, lower. And in Q2, 0 and 0. Central was -7 and -8 last year and 0 and 0 in Q1 and then 0 and 0 in Q2. Stock compensation was -4 and -4, and then Q2 it was -2 and -2. Quarterly adjustment in Q1 was +8 and +8. That +8 last year was compared to the prior year, a one-time charge for an initiative in Washington State that we funded for alcohol. And then quarterly adjustment is 0 and 0 in Q2.","So, all told, reported in Q1 was a +7, meaning that SG&A was better or lower by 7 basis points in Q1 year over year, +1 total without gas inflation. And then in Q2, again it was -2 and -2, so again, higher by 2 basis points.","Within core operations, our payroll as a percent of sales improved year over year by 5 basis points. It was lower by 5 basis points. Total payroll dollars increased a little over 6% in Q2, compared to the 80% sales increase. So a good showing there. This improvement in payroll was offset by higher costs in benefits and healthcare, including healthcare and workers comp. Pretty much a wash between those things. Some of that was accrual related. Again, these are big expense numbers that we also do actuarial things for.","Our central expense, it was flat year over year in Q2. Notwithstanding ongoing IT modernization costs, I think in Q1 we said that was 6 or 7 basis points year over year increase. On an ongoing IT modernization basis, we\u2019re not halfway through, but into the second year of a 3+ year project. It represented, on an ongoing basis, we estimated about a 3 or 4 basis point hit over the coming quarters, year over year.","Next on the income statement line is preopening. It was $6 million in both Q2 last year and this year. Now, last year we only had two openings, this year five. And really no surprises. A lot of it has to do with timing, preopening starts in some cases many months before the actual opening in terms of the costs associated with it. All told, operating income in Q2 was up $94 million, or 15%, as operating income went from $644 million the $738 million year over year.","In terms of below the operating income line, reported interest expense was lower year over year, with Q2 coming in at $25 million, $2 million lower than the $27 million last year. Basically, we had one big reduction in interest expense in the quarter, and then an increase related to the recent debt offering.","As you\u2019ll recall, last year, on March 15, we paid off $900 million of what was five-year maturity fixed rate debt. The annual pretax interest savings to Costco paying that off, I think I mentioned back then, was about $46 million pretax per year, or about $10.5 million pretax for this quarter. So that would have made it lower by $10 million. Offsetting this reduction, of course, was about $8.5 million of additional interest expense related to our recent debt offering.","As you know, on November 28, we completed a $3.5 billion debt offering in the form of senior notes, a combination of three, five, and seven year notes with a weighted average maturity of five years and an all-in annual rate of interest just under 1.25%, which again is about $44 million pretax per year currently. And so that\u2019s about a $9 million increase in interest expense for the roughly 11.5 of the 12 weeks that it was issued and outstanding during the quarter. So pretty much a wash between those things and that\u2019s why interest expense year over year was pretty much in line with last year.","Interest income and other was higher year over year by $16 million a quarter. Last year it was $10 million. This year it was $26 million. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $11 million, the same amount year over year. The other component of interest income and other amounted to income of $15 million this year versus $1 million of negative last year or a $16 million swing.","About $13 million of the $16 million year over year change was related to forward foreign exchange contracts we used to manage the cost of U.S. dollar merchandise purchases in our international operations. These contracts are required to be mark-to-marketed each quarter end, and the change year over year was attributable to the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar as of the end of Q2 of this year versus a general weakening compared to the U.S. dollar in these various foreign currencies in Q2 of last year. Last year, again, we recognized a small loss related to it. This year we recognized a gain.","Now, mind you, and again, this doesn\u2019t show as part of our gross margin, this is where you put these FX contracts, but this is generally done by our buyers in foreign countries, where they are basically locking in typically foreign currency or U.S. dollar merchandise purchases in many cases, where they\u2019ve locked that in, and so again, as it relates to the buyers, many of them consider that part of their margin, although we show it here.","Our company tax rate this quarter came in at 25.1% versus 34.2% last year in Q2. As discussed earlier on the call, the income tax line benefited primarily from a $62 million tax benefit in connection with that portion of the special cash dividend paid by the company in December of 2012 to the employee 401k plan participants. At such time, Costco shares held by employees in the plan approximated 22.6 million shares. These were held to an employee ESOP established several years ago. Dividends paid on these shares were deductible for U.S. income tax purposes, and we recognize that one-time tax benefit during the quarter.","Excluding the one-time benefit, our tax rate in Q2 came in at 33.5%, slightly lower compared to the last year\u2019s 34.2% during that. Basically, a combination of a few positive discrete items that went our way in Q2. Ongoing, we estimate our effective tax rate, barring anything unusual, for the balance of \u201813, to be in the range up to 35%.","Overall, net income was up 39% versus last year\u2019s second quarter, and excluding the one-time benefit the 39% increase would have been 23% on a net income basis, and as I mentioned earlier 22% on an earnings per share basis.","A quick rundown of a couple of other topics. The balance sheet will be included in the information packet that you can get online. Actually it was in the press release as well. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $217 million, and $430 million year to date. The other component that we\u2019re asked about is our inventories to payables ratio, since we\u2019re a high-turn business and we fund a lot of our inventories with trade payables. It improved year over year as of the second quarter end.","On a reported basis, it looks really great, 98% at the end of Q2 versus 91% AP as a percent of inventory. Given our ramp up of expansion right now, there\u2019s a lot of non-merchandise payables in there, for construction and related stuff. So it really, on a merchandise inventories to merchandise payables, it was 86% a year ago and it showed a little improvement to 87% this year. So certainly in the right direction there.","Average inventory per warehouse was up $600,000 from $11.6 million per warehouse a year ago to $12.2 million this year. So up about 5% on the 8% sales increase. A little under half of that $600,000 per warehouse increase related to higher levels of merchandise in consumer electronics and small electrics, with the balance mostly spread over mostly other non-foods departments.","Overall, our inventories are in good shape. No big markdown issues due to the recent holidays as well as our midyear fiscal inventories, which we take in January and February, halfway through our fiscal year, were our best ever.","In terms of capital expenditures, in Q1 we spent $488 million, in Q2 we spent $455 million, for a total of $943 million through the first half. I\u2019d estimate that for the year it will be in the $2 billion range, compared to last year, for the whole year, of about $1.5 billion. And again, that certainly reflects our ramp up in openings.","In terms of Costco Online, as you know we operate both in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. now. Both sales and profits were up again in Q2, and Q2 year to date. As you know, we replatformed the site last fall, and also have our first apps. And so far, so good.","In terms of expansion, as, again, I mentioned, we have no relos or closings this year. But in terms of units, basically for the four fiscal quarters, nine in Q1, five in Q2, five in Q3, and nine in Q4. That would put us at 28 for the year, up from 16 net new openings in fiscal \u201812, and 20 in fiscal \u201911, so finally we got up a little bit there.","If you go back to fiscal \u201912, the 16 units on the base of 592 was about 3% square footage growth. The 28 this year is assuming we can get them all open, on a basis of 608 that we began the year with, which would be a square footage growth in the 4.5% to 5% range.","New locations by country for the year, of the 28, would be 13 in the U.S. and three in Canada, three in the U.K., a total of 7 in Asia, one in Taiwan and one in Korea and five in Japan, and one each in Australia and Mexico. As of Q2 end, total square footage stood at 88,986,000 square feet.","In terms of stock buybacks, we did not purchase stock in Q2. As you know, we purchased quite a bit less than we had in the last couple of years in Q1. Certainly during the first several weeks of Q2, we completed a special dividend and the debt offering, and through the holidays. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole lot to read into that at this point. Sometimes we\u2019ll buy a little more, sometimes a little less, and as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019ll let you know each quarter.","In terms of dividends, current quarterly dividends stand at $0.275 per share per quarter, or $1.10 a year. This currently represents annualized dividend costs for the regular dividend of $480 million. That\u2019s of course in addition to the $7 special dividend, which totaled a lot of $3 billion paid out to shareholders in December of 2012.","As I mentioned, the supplemental information packet will be posted to the Costco investor relations site later this morning. Lastly, our third quarter scheduled earnings release date will be May 30. That\u2019s a Thursday, I believe. That will be for the 12-week third quarter which ends on May 12.","With that, operator, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Drilling into payroll and benefits a little bit, if you looked at total labor costs, payroll is probably, what, 80% and benefits are 20%? Or something like that?","Richard Galanti","No. Keep in mind, benefits is everything from healthcare to FICA, to vacation and sick leave. It\u2019s everything. It\u2019s not just healthcare. The big one that has the most inflation in it, of course, is healthcare costs, and to a lesser extent, but percentage-wise this quarter, workers comp. But roughly for every payroll dollar it\u2019s about 50%, another $0.50 in the U.S., and less in other countries.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Well, because I\u2019m wondering, the 80-20\u2026","Richard Galanti ","Maybe 80-20 if you just did healthcare and benefits, yes. But I don\u2019t have the exact number off the top of my head.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","You said payroll was up 6%, right?","Richard Galanti ","Yeah, dollars.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","So if you look at the other part that would have offset that, the all-in benefits was probably up, what, double digit? Or not that high?","Richard Galanti ","I don\u2019t think it was up that high, no. I don\u2019t have that level of detail in front of me, but the big issue is, as I mentioned earlier, keep in mind, given we\u2019re talking about $25 billion sales numbers, every basis point is $2-2.5 million. Just accruals on a billion dollar annual U.S. healthcare cost and a $150 million annual workers comp cost, when you look at different actuarial numbers, you\u2019re always going to get plus or minus a few basis points. Sometimes plus, sometimes minus.","And it\u2019s kind of like, as I mentioned on some of the discrete income tax items, on those small little things, more went in the positive than in the negative. A couple of them were in the negative and the positive here.","So is healthcare and workers comp in the U.S. still inflationary? Yes. Healthcare, I think, is definitely in the low double digits in terms of the percentage dollar growth in Q2.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","And you still think you need what, about a 4.5 comp to leverage expenses, or has that changed?","Richard Galanti ","You know, it\u2019s somewhere in the 4-5 range. We\u2019ve given up on trying to figure it out, since there\u2019s so many other moving parts now, with international and manufacturing businesses, and everything else we do in life.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","On Kirkland, where does that stand roughly, when you think about percent of units sold and percent of dollars? And to what degree has that been growing?","Richard Galanti ","Well, I don\u2019t know the units off the top of my head. I would guess, we tend to try to build bigger packs and better quality. And there are examples, as you\u2019ve known in the past, from the tuna fish, where we sold our brand, which is packaged at a higher spec, higher quality than the leading national brands, at a higher price but a greater value. Let\u2019s assume on average it\u2019s a lower price point by 10% or 20% versus what we would sell the brand for.","You know, private label is in the low 20s, and continues to grow. And you know, when we talk about aspirational numbers, we\u2019d like to see a three in front of it instead of a two. But I don\u2019t know how long that takes. Certainly we keep adding new items. In the last couple of years, we\u2019ve certainly added several items in apparel and canned goods, those types of items.","I think I mentioned last quarter on the call, like the KS men\u2019s wool slacks, which is a very high quality slack, at $50 or $60, where we\u2019ve gone from low six-digit units to closing in on a million units a year. So those are the kinds of things that eke out some numbers too.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Is it growing as a percent of SKUs inside the club? I imagine maybe a little bit.","Richard Galanti ","Absolutely.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","So that mix you\u2019re getting, it\u2019s coming out to a flat gross. The positive mix you\u2019re getting from Kirkland to some degree is getting reinvested in price somewhere. I don\u2019t know where, but somewhere, right?","Richard Galanti ","Again, there\u2019s 100 moving parts. At the end of the day, I think you were one of the ones that pointed it out earliest, back in Q4 of \u201911, as we were \u201cinvesting in price\u201d and seeing some of the numbers come down, overall gross margins. Certainly, as I mentioned, the core is where a lot of it is. We saw that year over year trend flatten out in the last two quarters relative to being down 10 to 15 basis points on a year over year basis each quarter last year.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","And then just one last thing. And I don\u2019t know if you have anything to say about this, but what are you seeing in Texas with Sam\u2019s membership being increased? Anything different competitively than what you\u2019re seeing from them elsewhere, since they have that fee to play with?","Richard Galanti  ","We really don\u2019t see a lot of difference elsewhere. We generally try to be fiercely competitive everywhere. First of all, I think it would be too early to tell. I haven\u2019t looked that closely, but nobody has also mentioned in the last few budget meetings anything regionally big in terms of margin change. I\u2019m not suggesting it\u2019s not a little lower. It may very well be. I just don\u2019t know off the top of my head.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig from Citigroup.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup","Can you talk about your ecommerce strategy as you move outside of Canada, U.S., and U.K.? How should we think about it on a market by market basis? And then just from a SKU perspective, how should we think about your overlap between kind of online and offline?","Richard Galanti ","Well, just like we\u2019ve done with our bricks and mortar warehouses, when we go into a new country we do it slowly, and we see how it goes. So don\u2019t expect to see us in five more countries in the next 12 months. We certainly want to expand it, and we\u2019ll do so over the next few years in a methodical way. So our strategy is the same, do it as we normally do stuff.","I think we\u2019ve expanded some of the product categories to test some apparel items, and there\u2019s a little bit of overlap there, but it\u2019s still small. Historically, over the last few years, the view was this was an extension of our product line, not the same product line that we have in the warehouse. Typically, I used to hear numbers in the 80-90% range was not overlapping with the warehouse. And maybe it\u2019s a little lower percent today, but by no means going dramatically in that other direction.","We still don\u2019t put our stuff online of what\u2019s in every warehouse, and what the sales prices are in the warehouse and the bricks and mortar. One of the challenges in a fast-turning business like ours is we can sell that stuff pretty quickly. We\u2019d hate for a member to look at something and it says we have units in locations they\u2019re going to go shop at or something, and it not be there.","So at this point, we\u2019ll continue to do what we do, and we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far with the replatforming and all the little growth pains that you have when you redo stuff. As you might expect, it was more of a hassle for the buyers as they\u2019re learning how to use the new system and putting stuff on. But we\u2019re doing fine.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And then what do you attribute your renewal rates tweaking up to?","Richard Galanti ","I\u2019d like to think we\u2019re wonderful. It\u2019s everything we do. You know, the mantra around here is, as you\u2019ve known for a long time, is constantly driving quality up and prices down, and never being static, and constantly pushing ourselves and improving. I think Executive member certainly helps. Gas and food I\u2019m convinced, over the last four and a half years of a bad economy, has certainly driven more frequency. That helps. And more food. So any time we get another reason why you want to come shop at Costco, it\u2019s another reason why you\u2019re going to renew every year. And you know, we try not to disappoint.","And then to a lesser extent it\u2019s, you know, on Amex, there\u2019s autorenewal, of course. You can opt out of it. A cardholder can opt out of it. But certainly that\u2019s, in my view, less of an issue right now because the rate of increase is not as big as it used to be.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And then last question, if I go back and look over our model for a long period of time, it does seem, from an SG&A perspective, on the operations line, that there is a more consistent pattern in terms of leveraging the operations. Can you just discuss if there is anything that\u2019s significantly changed in terms of how you approach the operations, or any kind of philosophical changes, I guess?","Richard Galanti ","Nothing philosophical. A couple of things I mentioned on prior calls in the last several fiscal quarters are things like increased penetration in non-U.S. and Canada markets, where certainly in non-U.S. markets they related to healthcare costs, lower wage relative to price points in those markets. So you have a little lower payrolls, you certainly have lower healthcare costs. Those types of things help that. Increasing penetration.","I know I\u2019ve mentioned over the last few years, a couple of times, on a qualitative basis, the word focus. And as wonderful, again, as we think we are, in being efficient, when the economy got bad, everybody looks to see what can you do better? And what should you stop doing that you used to do but you don\u2019t need to do? And it\u2019s those little things.","I think, in the past year, I mentioned the example of overtime hours. We are probably pretty good at managing and minimizing overtime hours, but once we started getting all the 12 or 15 or so senior VPs of operations around the U.S. and the world every month at the budget meeting to report on it, guess what? When total hours were going up 3-plus percent year over year, or 3.5% to 4%, or whatever it was, overtime hours were going down 20-plus percent. Again, that\u2019s a year or two [spend] benefit, but those are the kinds of things that we\u2019ve gotten better at.","I think getting back to John Heinbockel\u2019s question earlier, about what do you need in comp sales, one of my canned answers in the last few years has been who knows what exactly the expense leverage is. I can only tell you that I believe that whatever it used to be is a lower number now because we\u2019ve gotten a little better in the bad economy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO.","Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets","Just on merchandise margins, it sounded like, giving us what your core merchandise margins did in \u201911 and \u201912 and then kind of comparing that to what happened in the first half of this year, it sounds like you\u2019re kind of trying to signal that we should not expect the first half of the year to be the trend for the remainder of the year. Did I read that right?","Richard Galanti  ","Well, we try not to signal other than to say\u2026 I know last year, as each quarter we showed that the core year over year [unintelligible] compared to the prior respective quarters of the prior year, when they were down 10 and 15 basis points year over year, that people would say, well, once you anniversary that for four quarters, does that mean you\u2019re investing in prices and getting more? And of course I would say, there\u2019s no telling what it will be. We\u2019ll continue to do what we do for a living.","Certainly we are confident that we want to try to increase earnings and sales, but we\u2019re going to try to do it by driving sales and lowering expenses first. But you know, so far so good. There\u2019s two quarters behind us this year that have shown, certainly, a better relative trend than the four fiscal quarters last year. But you know, I can\u2019t really tell you what the next quarter or next year\u2019s going to be.","Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets ","And then one of your competitors had also kind of signaled that they had accelerated their price initiatives. Are you seeing anything on that front? Are you changing anything in terms of your pricing in response?","Richard Galanti ","I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant, but we do what we do every day, and we haven\u2019t seen any big changes out there in general. And again, we and our competitors, and probably the one you\u2019re talking about, are both fiercely competitive, and as I\u2019ve said in the past, direct warehouse club competition, most particularly with Sam\u2019s, is going to be the most competitive that we have, and that hasn\u2019t changed over the years.","As we get questions about what happens when the supermarkets are doing something or other forms of retail food and sundries, as an example, that\u2019s less of a direct impact, with the exception of a few areas like fresh foods and fresh meats and everything, and some cuts of beef. But other than that, we haven\u2019t seen any dramatic deltas.","Karen Short - BMO Capital Markets ","And then last question, you\u2019ve been kind of giving this cannibalization impact on your total comp of about 50 basis points. Is it fair to say that that\u2019s kind of steady state for a while? I know you gave the cadence and the locations of new store openings in the back half of the year.","Richard Galanti ","Years ago, it used to be bigger, because we had a smaller base of units, even in the U.S., and we\u2019re opening, you know, a half a dozen units in L.A. or something like that. And we\u2019ve always just given it out. And then it got down so it was maybe a quarter of a percent cannibalization. And now it\u2019s back up to 50 or 60 in the last year. And yeah, it\u2019s not going to change dramatically from that. Certainly as we continue to ramp up expansion it stays in that range. I don\u2019t ever see it going to, you know, 1.5% or 2%. I don\u2019t know if it gets up from 50 or 60 to 80, but it probably stays up there as we continue to open, particularly in some of these new international markets, where we have very high volume units that we\u2019ve got to cannibalize them and get more locations open.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan from Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein","First question on expansion, it looks like you\u2019re now targeting 28 units this year. I think last quarter the budget was 30, although you\u2019ve always said units can slip. It looks like it lost to Korea and the U.S. Anything of note there? And anything to read into that?","Richard Galanti ","No, I think the U.S. one is one that\u2019s just delayed for six or nine months, and I\u2019m not sure about the other one. No, nothing unusual.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And then just sticking with expansion, there have been a few press reports of some interest in Europe and France and maybe you can update us on your thinking of continental Europe as a longer-term future opportunity.","Richard Galanti ","Well, I think we\u2019ve spoken generally, and there have been articles in the local and national press in those countries, like France and Spain, and I would say over the next couple of years, we hope to be open, but it\u2019s a long process in some of these countries as it relates to the zoning and the permitting and the approval and the appeals of residential and other businesses. So there\u2019s a lot of things going on. But we have people landed in a few different countries, including those two. And those are the most likely, but again, once we know more, we\u2019ll let you know.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","And then just on the LIFO, obviously you had a little bit of a benefit. How are you thinking about that through the year in terms of inflation, deflation? What are the merchants saying about what\u2019s coming down the pike?","Richard Galanti ","The only area I\u2019m hearing a little more inflation still is in protein, beef and poultry and pork. And that relates both to international demand for some of those items as well as the costs associated with the drought last year and grain prices, and corn and wheat and things like that. As freight costs have gone up a little, I don\u2019t think they went all the way down when freight costs peaked a few years ago, and then came back down, so I\u2019m not hearing a lot of inflationary talk out there. On balance, there\u2019s not a lot going either way with the exception of protein. That\u2019s really all I\u2019ve heard from our buyers.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","Final question, just on MFI. Fees came a little above our estimate, but it looks like we were fairly good at figuring out the dollar value of the membership fee increase. So two questions there. Was there anything else? Or is it just you had 1% growth in new members and high renewal rates that drove the little bit of upside to MFI? That\u2019s the first question. And then just kind of out of curiosity, is there any lumpiness through the year in terms of when renewals happen?","Richard Galanti ","On the first question, your thoughts are generally correct. On the second question, I probably need to go look at it again, but historically, since we generally try to get openings done - I\u2019m thinking of the U.S. holiday and seasonal calendar here, but you can take it to each country and do that as well.","But generally speaking, we\u2019d love to get every location opened as soon as possible, and every location opened the week before back to school and Labor Day to enjoy, again, Labor Day, back to school, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, seasonal, you name it, New Years. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s typically more done\u2026 And then of course if you\u2019re trying to push those to get open, you probably slow down a little bit in January and February.","So I think if you look back at the calendar, probably there is a little lumpiness of openings, probably not as much as there used to be. But then because of deferred accounting, and such a big piece is the total now, it\u2019s not as lumpy. It tempers some of that lumpiness even more.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein ","You know, U.S. comps have been really, really consistent. It looks like your business has been incredibly resilient and impervious to some of the pressures out there, like the payroll tax hike, the delay in tax rebates that the other retailers have pointed out. Have you guys done any work on how that might be impacting your business and any offsets to that?","Richard Galanti ","No. We kind of joke about that we don\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to analyze, other than driving the quality and lowering the prices and everything else will take care of itself. But I know back when the payroll tax holiday occurred, and some of those same companies were talking about how it did help them a little bit, and when asked, we basically indicated and looked at it, and indicated that we didn\u2019t really see much benefit from it. So I think the same thing is happening on the tail end the other way. It can\u2019t help, but it doesn\u2019t really seem to be impacting our numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JPMorgan.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan","Executive membership, 15,000 per week, it\u2019s slowed down here in the second quarter. Does that have to do with the timing of the opens in Japan? Do you generally over index the Executive in those countries versus domestic? And do you sit there and say, hey, do we need to step up Executive membership to a higher percentage of sales? As you think about what trap it could be in the future, is it something that you\u2019re watching and maybe saying, you know what, if Executive membership grows at a slower rate, then maybe our traffic could fall below that recent very consistent trend?","Richard Galanti ","Look, every day our people in our membership marketing department are coming up with ways to drive both new members and converting members to the Executive member, and then a higher percentage of new members are signing up as Executive members. I think we\u2019ve done a good job over the last few years of doing that.","I remember a few years back for every 100 members that signed up in the U.S., 10 or 12 were Executive members, and then a few years later it was in the low to mid-20s. Why? Because we started focusing on it a little bit in the warehouse. Not doing a whole lot of fancy stuff, but just doing the 80-20 rule that we\u2019re pretty good at. You know, what are the simple things we can do to drive this.","Certainly, trying to get people to also do the triple value play that we jokingly call it, is to also sign up for the Amex co-brand card. So all those things drive frequency, drive loyalty, drive sales. And so we\u2019re constantly looking at ways to do that. I think ultimately it\u2019s got to slow down a little bit.","We\u2019ve now had it in the U.S. for 13 or 14 years, and Canada for 7 or 9 years I think, and a few other countries for less time than that. Those other countries, though, are much smaller pieces of the total company pie.","So I think I would expect it to continue to come down a little bit, and I actually think 15 a week is still pretty good.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","Absolutely. You said one-third of your members are Executive, and two-thirds of the sales. Can you talk about the deviation around that? Is there a wide deviation around that among your stores, and maybe where some of your better and best stores are as an indicator of where potentially that could go?","Richard Galanti ","Well, I think it has less to do, if I think about it - I\u2019ll take the United States - with the typically geographic areas other than the operators in those areas push it a little harder. And we try to learn from them. And one of the benefits, I think, of our \u201913 four-week meetings, every four weeks, so 13 times a year, 13 fiscal period meetings out here for two and a half days, is each of those 15 or so senior VPs of operations, and in this example in the U.S. , the eight senior VPs of operations, gets up and one of the things they talk about is what\u2019s going on in these areas. And what are the new things they\u2019ve done to drive whatever? I think some do focus more than others. And we try to learn from that.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","I guess you have some stores where it\u2019s 40-50% of your membership base?","Richard Galanti ","Absolutely. Okay, I see what you\u2019re saying. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me, but if it\u2019s roughly a third or a little over a third overall, it\u2019s probably, in the U.S., in the mid to high 30s. Let\u2019s just make up a number here, 36. If it\u2019s 36, I would bet you, across the 430-plus locations, it would range anywhere from the high 20s to the low 50s. But I\u2019m shooting from the hip with that answer.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan  ","And just from an accounting perspective, can you talk about how the calendar shift might impact total sales versus comp in the next two quarters?","Richard Galanti  ","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal in the next two quarters. There\u2019s no Easter shift. It\u2019s in the same quarter. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a whole big deal there. Now, of course, in Q4 last year, it was a 17-week quarter, and I haven\u2019t looked that far out in terms of when Labor Day falls and that stuff. If Sunday, September 1 is fiscal year end, so I guess Labor Day is the second. So that might affect it a little bit too, but I haven\u2019t thought through that yet.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan  ","And last question. Online, you accept credit card purchases. So how does that change the profitability of an online versus an in-store transaction?","Richard Galanti  ","Well, one of the cost components, of course, online, and in store as well, is what we call bank charges, which is credit, debit, and other fees related to vault and cash and currency and check cashing. And online, we, of course, have the ability to, since you can\u2019t pay by cash or check online, we also accept other national forms of credit cards. Of course, in store, exclusively American Express in terms of branded national cards. And it\u2019s higher merchants fee elsewhere, so we have a higher bank charge line. Although we have, overall, a much lower SG&A number online, because 75%-plus of the goods are shipped factory direct. So there\u2019s a lot less handling. As a percent of sales, online is a more profitable business than bricks and mortar, but we do both.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark Miller - William Blair","It\u2019s encouraging to see the step up in club openings, particularly more coming in the first half of the year. And I wanted to get your view on, I know there\u2019s an objective to possibly accelerate the club growth further. I think it had been potentially as high as 6% you\u2019d hope, over the long run. But is that upper end of the objective becoming more credible in your view? Maybe you can just talk about that pipeline of club openings, as you look at that pool going out, say, three years. Is that group of opportunity stores growing at that type of rate?","Richard Galanti ","Probably six is a little high, but given that we were at three, and now we\u2019re getting towards five, that\u2019s a good sign. I think there\u2019s certainly a lot more in the pipeline now to give me a little more credibility with you in terms of what we talked about at the beginning of the year. And there\u2019s always going to be a couple that fall out, because we try to be optimistic that everything we\u2019ve got going on is going to work and get done on time, and maybe push the envelope at the end of any fiscal year to [unintelligible] still open.","Two years ago I was feeling that let\u2019s try to get into the low 20s at least, and we did 20 in 16. We thought we\u2019d be in this fiscal year and be talking about 30, and I think we have a good chance of actually hitting the 28. I think that going forward Craig would like to see it have a three in front of it, but probably a very low three in front of it. So, you know, if I was a betting person, over the next three years, fiscal \u201914, \u201915, and \u201916, 27 to 33 or 34, which would give you a 30 estimate. But I could off a few. I think we\u2019ve got enough in the pipeline to be able to do that. And we\u2019ll go from there.","Mark Miller - William Blair ","And then on preopening, you indicated that it was nothing particularly unusual there, but the preopening costs first half were up about a third, but the number of openings was more than double first half. Is that because you\u2019ve got the openings coming late in the year with the nine club openings in fourth quarter, or is the preopening cost coming down a little bit for you?","Richard Galanti ","I would be willing to bet it\u2019s the former reason, not the latter. A lot of it just has to do with timing. And keep in mind, with reopenings, let\u2019s say that we\u2019re doing a lease, not an own, and you get the property four or five months in advance of opening. And we might have a few hundred thousand dollar charge per period for rent expense, which is preopening prior to the opening day. That alone might be a little over a million dollars on a location. Now, that\u2019s the exception, not the rule, since we own a lot of the units.","And certainly when we\u2019re building a multistory unit with parking and two stories of retail on a two-acre site in Japan or Korea, it takes a lot longer to do, so you might have even more preopening. And some of those are leased. So those are the kinds of things that will bump that number up the other way.","So overall, again, like everything around here, each location has a preapproved by Jeff and Craig, and the heads of the respective operations heads in those areas, of what preopening is going to be, and we hit it and miss it. But overall, we have a pretty good handle on what it is. The thing we don\u2019t have a good handle on sometimes when there\u2019s, again, a two or three month delay because of soils issues or rain or freezing ground, couldn\u2019t get the foundation laid before the ground froze. That could be $200,000 to $800,000 on a location of preopening during those several months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich from ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","I\u2019ll just follow up on the LIFO gain. Which area was actually deflating? Or which categories? And did any of that actually [unintelligible] from retail deflation?","Richard Galanti ","On the deflation, if I look at the [unintelligible], what we call foods and sundries, foods was down a little, about half a percent. Sundries was up less than 20 basis points. Apparel was down a little bit. Electronics and appliances were down a little bit more than that, but still less than 2 percentage points.","A [unintelligible], which is a mixture of things, including gas and sporting goods and office and auto, is down a shade, and then alcohol and tobacco, beer, and wine is up a shade. But overall, it\u2019s down a little over a half a percent from the beginning of the year. And again, certainly the bigger deflationary items are still electronics.","And sometimes there\u2019s deflationary items like\u2026 I\u2019m looking at the top 20 deflationary components. You know, there\u2019s, aside from a small amount from gas, and the biggest chunk is electronics, pecans, they\u2019re down 20%. Well, that\u2019s because they were probably double last year, or whatever it was. So sometimes you have these giant commodity price increases a year ago, particularly in the nuts category or something, grains, and then it comes down the other way.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","And the $600,000 increase in inventory per warehouse, could you help us sort of break that down and figure out where it\u2019s going into, that investment?","Richard Galanti ","I think right at $200,000 of it was electronics. And another $75,000-plus of it was small electrics. And then we definitely expanded apparel. I gave the example of the wool pants. We\u2019ve got a much better, I think, commitment to apparel. And then there\u2019s a lot of little stuff everywhere else. But the single biggest component is consumer electronics. And you know, you go into the warehouse, you see a lot of 60-inch and 80-inch TVs now. And tablets.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","Just to maybe understand a little bit better, as you grow the online business, how should we think about the inventory for warehouse vis-\u00e0-vis the online growth. Is it the same SKU assortment? Is it an extended assortment?","Richard Galanti ","Right now, it\u2019s an expanded assortment. It\u2019s not the same. Certainly you\u2019re going to see some overlap on electronics or a few apparel items, but you\u2019re going to see more SKU selection online. Whatever changes you\u2019re going to see there are going to be very slow in terms of percentages, because the brick and mortar is so big.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","And then lastly, you mentioned on the accruals, and we know that just $2 million or $2.5 million is one basis point, but the ones that you cited in this quarter, was that sort of a one-off catch up accruals, or do you think now there\u2019s a different sort of accrual run rate for those things you cited?","Richard Galanti ","No, I don\u2019t have the exact basis points in front of me, but like workers comp, I think there was a couple of basis points there. And my guess is there\u2019s a little catch up in that number. Again, I get back to the income tax. We benefited by several million dollars - I\u2019m not talking about the big, $62 million number, but there are discrete items. Usually, when you\u2019ve got to squeeze anything, there\u2019s two or three pluses and two or three minuses, and it balances out to be very little, a basis point or two. My guess is there were three or four here. So it\u2019s not a whole lot. I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into that.","Greg Melich - ISI Group  ","And then lastly, on the club openings, as we do more outside of North America, how should we think about capex in terms of how many of those might actually be leased? I know you\u2019re 90%-plus here, but as we go international, are most of those units in Asia and elsewhere going to be leased?","Richard Galanti ","Probably a little more of them are leased or at least ground leased. And with long term ground leases. We still try to buy where we can, and I think we\u2019re getting a little more aggressive on that, but it\u2019s hard to predict. I think overall, we\u2019re in the low 80s in terms of how many we own. But I know even in the U.S., when interest rates plummeted four years ago, a lot of times, when you have an individual landowner, they don\u2019t want the cash. And so we\u2019ve done a few more leases in the U.S. as well in the last several years. But certainly there\u2019s probably a higher proportion of those done in areas like Asia. I think we own more in Japan. Like, Korea, I think we lease more. But every country\u2019s a little different. And the three Asia countries, I think, overall, there\u2019s more leases there, of course, than in the U.S.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","So maybe asked a different way, if there\u2019s 27 or 28 openings, is it fair to say that maybe this year, given where they are, that half are leased and half are owned? Or would that be too extreme?","Richard Galanti ","No, we\u2019ll still own more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jefferies.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company  ","First, on IT modernization costs, I didn\u2019t hear you call it out this quarter. I know it\u2019s been adding some pressure. Are we now kind of through the worst on that?","Richard Galanti ","No, I think on an ongoing basis, looking over the next few quarters, and this is a guess, it\u2019s somewhere in the three to four basis point year over year. I think it was higher in Q1, it was closer to flat in Q2. But some of that is just, again, timing of things. You also capitalize some of those costs. Again, overall, my guess, over a two or three year period, it\u2019s going to add sometimes three, sometimes five.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company  ","I remember last year you guys were very focused on some of the operational opportunities to improve your cost structure. You called out some of that today. Overtime reduction was one of them, which you mentioned earlier. I\u2019m just curious, as you look at the organization today, are there any big buckets where you can still pull costs out?","Richard Galanti ","I don\u2019t think there have been any big buckets, even, by the way, I did mention the overtime. 20%-plus reduction in overtime hours. That was several million dollars a year, maybe a basis point or two over a couple of years. But nothing like everybody thought that RFID would free up the front end and reduce our biggest labor cost area. That ain\u2019t happening. But we have done a better job [unintelligible] and tackling the little things. And there\u2019s still the focus out there, but other than driving sales, again little things here, but we\u2019ve streamlined and tested and now rolling out how we return merchandise. In some cases, not doing it at the warehouse but bringing it into some of the depots. And if that can continue to work, do we save a few million here, $5 million there? Yes. But there\u2019s no giant thing out there.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company  ","I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but did you comment on the dotcom sales growth, and the contribution to comps this quarter?","Richard Galanti ","No. I think it was in the low teens in terms of sales growth.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company  ","And what does that look like in terms of contribution to comp?","Richard Galanti ","I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re going to do in the high twos for the year on whatever your budget is for total sales for the company, so it\u2019s 2.5% of sales, and up in the low teens.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","And then on consumer electronics sales, I know that you called out the calendar issue that affected the quarterly number, but generally your monthly sales updates have been showing some pretty good strength in that category. I was just wondering if you could speak to some of the bigger trends that you\u2019re seeing take place in the club there.","Richard Galanti ","Well, I think with electronics, the biggest takeaway is our TV sales in general. TV sales are the biggest piece of electronics. While that was down slightly in February, over the last several months it\u2019s been up in the mid to very high single digits. And a lot of that, I\u2019ve been told in the budget meetings, relates to the fact that we\u2019ve done very well with 60-80 inch TVs. As you know, we stopped selling some of the Apple products, the ones that we were allowed to sell, maybe two years ago, so on that low base, we are starting to sell some of the other tablets and the like. The cellphone business is pretty good. But again, it\u2019s all dwarfed by TVs.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker with Montag & Caldwell","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell","I just had a clarification on the website. What impact have you seen from making it searchable and adding the mobile apps? Has it been anything notable now that you\u2019re sort of more visible?","Richard Galanti ","Well, I think sales are up a little better than they have been, but the first thing is I know for the months leading up to it, everybody was warning us, from our own dotcom people to the IT people, that the day you flip the switch is not the day you start to see immediate benefit, because it takes time to build the clicks and all that stuff. But again, kind of like the other things we do, we\u2019re methodical and slow about it, and it\u2019s showing some improvement. But off the top of my head, I can\u2019t give you any specifics.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","And I can\u2019t remember, is Jim still in the building a little longer? What\u2019s he focused on?","Richard Galanti ","Jim is on vacation this week, but yes, he\u2019s still here a lot. Somebody asked me the other day, you go to Craig to ask questions, to get permission to do stuff. And Jim\u2019s still traveling, and he\u2019s still on the board, of course, and I see him quite a bit. But to his credit, and I think to the company\u2019s success, it\u2019s been a very good a little over three-year transition with he and Craig, and he\u2019s still traveling a lot to openings and with the merchants and with Craig, and spends a lot of time with Craig and Jeff still. But he\u2019s doing a good job of staying away a little more. If you asked me six months ago, I would have said he\u2019s in the office 80% of the time. Now it\u2019s still well above 50%. But we\u2019ll see. He\u2019s still doing well.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Bob Drbul from Barclays.","Bob Drbul - Barclays ","I just had two questions for you. The first one is I think you said new member signups in the metrics in international markets versus the U.S. and Canadian markets, the number is higher abroad. Can you tell us how much higher it is? And the second question is, you talked about the buyback a little bit, but on the buyback going forward, is there any reason why you wouldn\u2019t be active at these levels where the stock is?","Richard Galanti ","I\u2019ll take the last question first. No, we look at it, and we\u2019ll keep looking at it. I think generally speaking, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we issue our issues that add 3-3.5 million shares a year. It would be nice to cover that, but we don\u2019t feel pressure on a given day or week to do something. Generally speaking, we still feel good about the company long term, and again, I think at this point, we\u2019ll wait for 12 weeks and see what we\u2019re doing.","On the other question, what was it?","Bob Drbul - Barclays ","How much higher are the new member signups in international markets versus the U.S. and Canada?","Richard Galanti ","I\u2019ll give you some general numbers. Keep in mind, when we talk about opening day signups, it\u2019s for the generally 8-12 weeks leading up to the opening day, when the parking lot\u2019s partly done and you can get in and out of the parking lot, and people come in and sign up in advance of opening. There\u2019s the little flags outside and the whole bit with the table and activities. And you know, in the U.S., when we\u2019ve opened a new unit, even in a very strong existing market, you might have a few thousand signups, because you\u2019ve already got a lot of people in that market, and it\u2019s not like this giant thing for a new market.","I was at an opening back in the Carolinas four or five months ago. And it\u2019s a relatively medium-sized town, less than a million people, and a brand new market, and through opening day signups for those several weeks, and they\u2019re all booked, if you will, starting on opening day, was in the 6,000 or 7,000, which was better than we would have thought. We have some openings that we\u2019ve done over in Asia and Australia, where through opening day we\u2019ve had anywhere from 20,000-60,000 members signed up.","Now, mind you, you\u2019re going to have a much lower renewal rate on those a year later, but our membership numbers, and we\u2019ve been in Japan for a while now, and we also have some new units there, the number of members per unit over there is a little over double what the company is running. So it\u2019s a little different metric in some of those markets. Quite a bit. So when you open four or five of those, that\u2019s going to jump your membership increase, the number of members, recognizing we don\u2019t use deferred accounting for counting members, but for their dollars we do.","Okay, well thank you. Bob and Jeff and I are around. Appreciate your time today."],"6016":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q1 2017 Earnings Conference Call December  7, 2016  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - EVP and Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley & Co.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank Research","Michael Lasser - UBS","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","Sean Carson - Barclays Capital","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company, LLC","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","Robert Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Peter Benedict - Robert W.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Costco First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Kimberlynn. Good afternoon to everyone. Please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","For the 12-week fiscal first quarter, that ended two weeks ago Sunday \u2013 this past Sunday, earnings came in at $1.24 a share, up 14% or $0.15 a share over last year's reported earrings per share of $1.09. A few items to point out, as was mentioned in today's release, this year's first quarter benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million pre-tax figure represented a 19 basis point benefit to gross margin and a benefit to first quarter's earnings per share of $0.07 a share.","Last year in the first quarter there were two non-recurring items that we mentioned that together negatively impacted last year's earnings results. In that quarter, we recorded a $22 million pre-tax charge, which represented an 8 basis point impact to SG&A to the negative and a reduction in last year's first quarter earnings of $0.04 a share.","Stock compensation expense was 13% or $25 million higher year-over-year, so $0.04 a share more. There are about 4,800 people of our employees that receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter, and then typically vest over a five-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25 years, 30 years and 35 years of employment with the Company.","Factors driving this increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of our employees achieving long tenure with the Company. An increased stock price with a five-year ago grant coming off of the thing when the stock price was in the 80's to last year's grant when the stock price was in the 150\u2019s and of course having a larger number of employees in the plan.","Note that the $25 million year-over-year increase in Q1 is a larger year-over-year dollar increase than we'd expect to record in each of the second, third and fourth fiscal quarters of this year, given the October RSU grant cycle. Next, gas profitability, our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's first quarter were lower by about $20 million pre-tax or $0.03 a share, primarily a function of last year's very strong profit results in the first quarter for gas.","Fifth, IT costs. These expenses negatively impacted SG&A in the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $18 million or 5 basis points to SG&A, which is about $0.025 a share. And lastly, when I get to the discussion on year-over-year gross margin and SG&A comparisons, I\u2019ll review with you the very positive impact that our new Citi Visa deal has had on margins, SG&A and of course our bottom line.","Turning to the first quarter sales, total reported sales were up 3% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure on a reported basis came in at 1% year-over-year. Comp sales were negatively impacted by weaker FX relative to the U.S. dollar and slightly impacted by gas price deflation, for a combined negative impact to the reported comp number of about 0.75% of sales.","Excluding gas deflation, the reported 1% U.S. comp figure for Q1 remained at 1%. The reported Canadian comp figure plus 4% would have been plus 5% ex-gas deflation in FX. And the reported 0% other international comp figure excluding gas and FX would have been plus 3%. Total comps reported at 1% for the quarter again excluding gas and FX, would have been plus 2% and of course this plus 2% total Company adjusted figure is also being impacted by increases in deflation and other merchandising categories overall primarily in foods and hardlines.","In terms of new openings, in the first quarter we opened nine new locations which included one relo, so a net increase of eight. And later in the call, I will discuss our upcoming expansion plans for the balance of the fiscal year. This afternoon, I\u2019ll also touch on membership trends and renewal rates, again, discuss margins and SG&A in Q1; update on the Citi Visa, the new Citi Visa relationship and the card and which we began offering in the U.S. and Puerto Rico this past June 20th during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016, talk about e-commerce and then a couple of other items of note.","So going down the income statement, again sales for the first quarter, the 12 weeks ended November 20 were $27.5 billion, up 3% from last year's first quarter of $26.6 billion. And again, on a comp basis reported 1% in ex-gas and FX up 2%, again that up 2% still being impacted by other aspects of deflation that we hadn't called out historically.","For the quarter, the plus 1% reported comp results were a combination of an average transaction decrease of 1.3% on a reported basis and an average shopping frequency increase of 2.2% to the positive. Now the average transaction decrease of 1.3%. This includes again the combined headwinds of FX and gas that I mentioned which is about 0.75%, and I am sure other levels of deflation in other categories. I will give some examples of that later in the call.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, within the U.S., Northwest Texas and Midwest showed the best results. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, UK and Korea. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, in terms of sales for those within food and sundries, overall, flat year-over-year with spirits, sundries and deli coming in best. Tobacco, of course, as I mentioned in the last call was down a little over 20% year-over-year as we continue to see lower sales in that category. As I mentioned before these big tobacco declines should anniversary this coming spring.","For hardlines, also flat year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were hardware, tires, and health and beauty aids. I give you an example of deflation which is impacting this department. And November for example, our reported November sales, TV sales in dollars were up 2% and units were up 17%, so quite a bit of deflation on big ticket items as well as some of the fresh foods items that I mentioned earlier.","Within softlines, up low single-digit comps with apparel, small electrics and special events being the standouts. And within fresh foods, produce and deli were the strongest departments. And in ancillary businesses, hearing aids and optical showed the best results. Again, in recent months we have seen additional deflation overall in the low-to-mid single-digit range in many food and fresh meat categories and a little more in some of the other non-food areas as I mentioned like electronics.","Moving to the line items on the income statement, membership fees good results for the first quarter, coming in up 6% and 6 basis points as a percent of sales, up $37 million year-over-year. In terms of membership fees, good renewal rates, 90% U.S. and Canada actually 90.3% and 88% worldwide, rounding up to 88%. Continued increasing penetration of the executive membership and in terms of number of members at Q1 end, compared to fiscal year end 12 weeks earlier, Gold Star which stood at 36.8 million accounts, at Q1 end it was 37.1 million.","Primary business was 7.3, both at fiscal year end and at Q1 end. Business add-ons 3.5 and 3.5. For total membership, household memberships 47.6 million at fiscal year end and up to 47.9 million at first quarter end and given that many of the people have two cards, many of the accounts have two cards. At fiscal year end, we stood at 86.7 million in cardholders and at first quarter end 87.3 million people with a membership card.","At November 20 first quarter end, Executive Members stood at 17.7 million member households, an increase of 348,000 since the end of the previous quarter. That's about 29,000 additional Executive Members per week increased during the 12-week quarter. And as I have said before, Executive Members are a little over a third of our base and a little bit more than two-thirds of our sales where Executive Members are offered.","In terms of renewal rates, our business renewal rate, which at fiscal year end stood at 94.4%, came in at 94.3% renewal rate as of first quarter end. Gold Star at 89.5% both at fiscal year end and at the first quarter end. For total 90.3% at fiscal year end and it remained at 90.3% at first quarter end. Worldwide, at year end it was 87.6% and it [tick to] [ph] 87.5% at first quarter end.","As you know it's been probably almost two years in Canada when we converted to the MasterCard and with that we saw as we would have expected a slight decline in renewal rate. As occurred in Q4 2016 this past summer, we saw that finally reverse, and saw an uptick in renewal rates in Canada and that continued in Q1 of this fiscal year too. We are now seeing the same thing in the U.S. had ticked down a little bit over the last couple of quarters and have ticked down a little bit as well in Q1. We don't see any issues there at this point.","Regarding membership fees, at the beginning of this past September or beginning of our fiscal year, we increased membership fees in our Asia operations, Taiwan, Korea and Japan as well as in Mexico and the UK. And again, that's because of \u2013 due to deferred accounting. It is about 15% of our membership fee income base and due to deferred accounting and the fact that it will roll in over the next 12 months in September that will be a little less than $0.01 a share a quarter.","Before continuing down the income statement line items, a quick update on the Citi Visa card offering. This past June 20, midway through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we stopped accepting AMEX, American Express at all U.S. and Puerto Rico Costcos and at costco.com and began accepting all Visa cards, including of course, the new Citi Visa Anywhere card.","The new card is great in terms of increased cash back rewards for our members and that\u2019s great for us as well in terms of driving member value and sales over the next years, and of course lowering our effective merchant fees related to the new program. In terms of new card, as was mentioned over the last couple of quarters on these calls, there were approximately 11.4 million AMEX, American Express co-branded cards or about 7.5 million accounts that were transferred from American Express to Citi for conversion to the new Citi Visa Anywhere card as over 85% of the accounts transferred over have been activated.","And since the June 20 cutover several months ago, we have 1 million members that have signed up for have been approved for the new Citi Visa card. Most of them have it in hand, but to the extend that it was the last couple of weeks; they may not have gotten their card yet. In terms of conversion, usage and new sign up for the card, all good so far.","Now turning to gross margin. Our reported gross margin in the first quarter was higher year-over-year by 29 basis points coming in at 11.58 this year versus 11.29 last year. As usual, a heavy jot down for the quarter a few numbers will just make the two columns for the quarter, reported and without gas deflation.","In terms of core merchandising, year-over-year in the first quarter, core merchandising was up 19 basis points of 16 without gas deflation. Ancillary businesses down 5%, minus 5 year-over-year and for the quarter minus 6 without deflation, 2% reward, minus 2 in the quarter on a reported basis, minus 1 without gas deflation. LIFO minus 2 and minus 2, other which is the big one-time non-recurring benefit we got from the litigation settlement plus 19 basis points both for the reported and without gas.","All told for the quarter, we reported again the 29 basis point improvement in ex-gas deflation and 26 basis points. So overall, again 26 basis points up on a kind of ex-gas basis. The core merchandise component was higher by 19 basis points year-over-year and again 16 without the gas deflation. The majority of the core gross margin increase and already taking out, we've separated out already the one-time legal settlement. About 13 basis points of that 16 if you will was due to higher year-over-year revenue share and bounties associated with the new Citi Visa agreement.","Some of those monies go to the revenue line as revenue share. The gross margin of our notwithstanding debt, the gross margin of our core merchandising categories, which are the food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods. That gross margin as a percent of their own sales were higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 17 basis points with foods and sundries, hardlines and fresh foods all showing higher year-over-year margins and softlines being down a little bit year-over-year and one of the impacts was the warmth of the season and outerwear issues.","Ancillary and other business gross margin was down 5 basis point, 6 basis points, ex-gas deflation in the quarter. All the function of the lower year-over-year gas profits as I discussed earlier in the call, ex-gasoline operations, all other ancillary and other business gross margins were up 6 basis points. 2% reward, again ex-gas, a negative impact of 1 basis point and that's inside margin. That's a sales penetration and the associated executive member awards from our executive members continue to grow.","LIFO in the first quarter flat this year, we did not book a LIFO credit card charge and compared to a 2 basis point positive or a $5 million pre-tax credit last year in the quarter. And lastly, the one-time non-recurring legal settlement has benefited Q1 gross margin by 19 basis points as we discussed in beginning of the call.","Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the first quarter year-over-year was higher by 16 basis points on a reported basis and by 13 basis points on ex-gas deflation. Again, I'll have you just jot down a few line items, core operations for the quarter was higher or negative 8 basis points and without gas the negative 6. Central higher by 9 and 9 both reported without gas deflation. Stock compensation expense minus 7 and minus 6. Other plus 8 and plus 8 that\u2019s that rough $20 million or $22 million amount that I told you about earlier in the call that impacted SG&A to the positive last year versus nothing this year.","And again reported SG&A was higher by 16 basis points in the quarter higher by 13 ex-gas deflation. The core operations component of SG&A again in the chart shows 8% higher \u2013 I\u2019m sorry 8 basis points higher year-over-year reported and 6 ex-gas. This minus 6 consisted of higher payroll and benefits of about 31 basis points year-over-year that certainly impacted by the lower sales result and certainly that's impacted by the deflation I\u2019ll give you a couple examples of that later.","This was primarily offset by lower year-over-year merchant fees as a result of the switch to Citi Visa. That had a benefit to the SG&A line of plus 25 basis points impact of the positive. Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q1 by 9, increased IT spending again as I mentioned was 5 of that. Stock compensation expense higher by 5 or 6 without gas. And lastly, the other item I mentioned the plus 8 was non-recurring in nature.","Next on the income statement line pre-opening expense was $4 million lower this year versus last year coming in at $22 million versus $26 million a year-ago really a function of openings. This year in Q1 we had 9 openings, last year 13 each of the 9 included 1 relo in the 13 last year in the first quarter and 2 relos, pretty much in line with that number of openings.","All told, operating income in the first quarter came in up $82 million or 11, but up $9 million or 1% year-over-year excluding the - just the non-recurring items that I previously mentioned. Below the operating income line, interest expense in the first quarter came in at $29 million this year versus $33 million in last year. Lower due to the retirement of some senior notes in December of last year.","Interest income and other was lowered by $2 million in the quarter coming at $26 million versus $28 million a year ago. Actual interest income from the quarter was better year-over-year this was offset by approximately $4.5 million in charges related to the FX transactions that usually fluctuate pluses and minuses in the zero to 10 million range, so no surprises there.","Overall, reported pre-tax income on a reported basis was higher by 11% again higher by 1% ex those non-recurring items that I mentioned earlier in the call. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the first quarter came in at 34.4 for the quarter compared to 36.1 last year. We benefited from a couple of positive discrete items this year in Q1, our anticipated effective rate for the years expected to be approximately 35.2% as best we can tell at this point. Overall reported net income $545 million this year up $65 million from $480 million last year, so an increase of 14% ex the non-recurring items that I mentioned up 3%.","And next for a quick rundown of other topics, while the balance sheet is included in this afternoon's press release. A couple of the balance sheet info items, depreciation and amortization from the cash flow statement which is not here for the quarter came in at $297 million for the quarter. Accounts Payable if you look at one of things we always look at is our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. On a reported basis it was up from a 100% a year-ago in the quarter and 203%. If you take out 9 merchandise payables and more of an accounts payable of merchandise versus inventories improved from a 90% to 93% from last year's first quarter into this year's first quarter end.","Average inventory per warehouse was actually lower by about $67,000 per warehouse coming in right at $14.9 million a year ago and $14.83 million per location this year. FX was about roughly $70,000 lower, FX was about $170,000 lower just the impact of FX so about 100 net if you assume flat FX. That\u2019s about what majors was up electronics, it was up a $117,000, so really not a lot of pluses and minuses over sub-departments but pretty much in line and pretty much flat year-over-year.","In terms of CapEx we spent approximately $670 million during the quarter and our estimate for the whole year as I mentioned hasn\u2019t changed from last quarter end, our expectation for fiscal 2017 is somewhere in the $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion range compared to $2.6 billion for all of fiscal 2016.","Next, Costco online, we're now in of course in the U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico and more recently Korea and Taiwan. For the first quarter sales and profits were up, total online sales were up 8% in the quarter and 7% on a comp basis, pretty choppy essentially the first several weeks and the last several weeks of the quarter we're in the mid singles with the middle part of it in the low doubles, if you will.","I want to point out that over the past three weeks and that would include the last week of Q1, which is the Thanksgiving week, and the first two weeks of our second fiscal quarter, e-com sales were up in the low to mid teens including some results for both Black Friday and Cyber Monday. And of course, that's not withstanding significant amount of TV sales which were essentially flat in dollars and up 15% in units.","Lastly, as it relates to our online business, we are improving our offerings and enhancing our member experience. I've touched on this a little bit last quarter\u2019s call. Our current focus comes in three primary areas in terms of improving merchandise first, we are adding more exciting high-end brand in merchandise on an everyday basis, we are improving in stocks and high velocity items and there is a few other things that we will be doing coming in the first couple of months of the new calendar year.","Second, we are improving the experience and functionality of our site, we are improving our search that we have and are continuing to do that. We have shortened the checkout process from many clicks to two and so a big improvement recognizing this is new for us. We are simplifying and automating our returns process, a much better experience particularly on big ticket items and we have seen great improvement in that in the last several weeks and we are improving our members' ability to track their orders. Again, that's something that we were terribly good at historically.","And thirdly, we are improving our distribution logistics. We have increased the number of depots from where we fill online orders, so closer and faster and less expensive delivery. And again, look for more improved and quicker distribution comments from us in early calendar 2017.","Next, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we had eight net new units this year, this fiscal first quarter. We plan two for Q2 and net of five for Q3, so ex the relocations. And a net of 16 in Q4 for anticipated number for the year of net new units of 31, 34 less than three relos, so 31 net new locations. Last year, recall we opened 29 so about 4.5% square footage growth. If we get to the 31 that would be about the same, about 4.25% plus square footage growth.","Assuming the 31 net new openings in fiscal 2017 locations by country will be 16 in the U.S. Mind you that last year it was 21 out of 29 in the U.S., eight in Canada which is quite a number for Canada and one each in Taiwan, Korea, Japan, Australia and Mexico as well as France, our first in France and also one in Iceland. Note that these include our first locations to open in France and Iceland and again those will be in late spring and early summer.","Now as you can tell by the quarterly dispersion of these about half of the 31 planned openings are scheduled in Q4. To the extent a couple of those could slip into the next fiscal year, so be it. So somewhere in the very high 20s if not 30 or 31 is what we would expect.","As of first quarter end, our total square footage stood at 104.5 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases, for the first quarter, we repurchased 809,000 shares for a total of $122 million on an average price of $151 a share. That compares to all of fiscal 2016, when we repurchased $477 million, 3.2 million shares at an average price of just under $150 a share.","In terms of dividends, our currently quarterly dividend stands at $0.45 a share and that was a 12.5% increase and that was effective last spring. 12.5% increase from the prior $0.40 a share, so $0.45 a share on a quarter, so that yearly $1.80 dividend represents an annual cost to the Company of just under $800 million.","Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 2017 second quarter schedule earnings release, date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 12, will be after market close on Thursday, March 2 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.","I will now turn it back to Kimberlynn, and open it up for questions and answers. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, Richard the new Citi agreement, was that a \u2013 was a total benefit in the quarter of 38 basis points if I'm hearing you right and I assume that was exactly what you thought it would be?","Richard Galanti","Probably a little higher than we thought it would be. There's lots of nuances to the program in terms there's bounties that we received for signing up new members and applications that incents the warehouses to do that. There's revenue share on outside spend. I think that's a little more than we had anticipated. We knew and felt that over time it would go up because the exceptions of Visa in terms of the penetration Visa throughout all types of merchants and that happened a little faster than we had anticipated.","There's also some other aspects of it, again, there's lots of little pieces, but those are two of the bigger ones. On the merchant side, on the fee side rather I think some of it's related to the fact that we were making estimates of the different reward - bad - buckets if you will, gas at 4, Costco at 2, those velocity categories at 3. Again there's all kinds of equations there that as that changes there's some sharing and so it's all good at this point.","John Heinbockel","Well, as a sort of the follow-up to that is that recognizing there is some volatility, is roughly that level, is that what you would expect going forward. And right now it's covering right soft sales and some investments in labor would be \u2013 is the idea that when that \u2013 when the soft sales changes more of that drops to the bottom line or do you think you find other things to invest in?","Richard Galanti","Well, time will tell, won\u2019t it. I think it's still an early program, we're in the first full fiscal quarter of it. Over the next couple of quarters as I said last quarter this will be the first time we'll try to provide a little bit more insight and I'm sure we'll be able to do a little bit more each time. As you know, we're going to invest in loyalty and growth and \u2013 while it's raining on everybody as it relates to higher levels of deflation. We're known for deflating the sell price sooner and faster and certainly one other sound bite example would be meat sales, just in the month of November meat sales were up 6% in dollars and 16% in pounds. That's the kind of stuff that this deflation, it's impacting all retailers of course, and it's probably impacting a lower margin quicker to pass it on up or down and certainly down faster, so all those things go into play. So time will tell.","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, have you found or when you think about this conceptually, is it better to make - more impactful to make price investments when we start the reflationary cycle, right. So not raising while others do as opposed to cutting more now, investing more in a deflationary recycle.","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019re always going to do more extreme probably than others. Another example would be as I've said in the past as it relates to some different types of competition out there the competitive pricing moat has gotten wider which is good. We haven't used that to improve our margins consciously in that regard, the wider the better. And so we're constantly figuring out that. We are constantly going back to every supplier with our purchasing power, with our buying power as it relates to \u2013 and competition itself with private label to figure out how can we bring the quantity up, the quality up, and the price down.","And we know we will sell more and each of us and our suppliers will make a little more times \u2013 a little less more times. And so that's what we do, that's what we're always doing. We see that in every monthly budget meetings. And so I think that we'll continue to do what we do. We're certainly not going to benefit from every extra dollar of income. We're going to figure out how to use it to drive that competitive spirit and to drive our sales. And that's been a little tougher in this tough deflationary environment.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Hey guys. So my question relates to core profitability and expectations to the extent we can talk about it. So the EBIT growth this quarter was I think about 4% adjusted, the trend line has been a little lower and I'm not taking a lot of currency into this, but if you think about the core profitability going forward Richard, should we expect it to increase granted this quarter had a tough topline compare, we talked about maybe credit card getting better.","I'm not thinking about membership price increase, but that's something that could come, but is this \u2013 just thinking about the overall business, how it\u2019s performing, do you expect it to do better than where it is or performing about where it should be?","Richard Galanti","Well, again I'm not allowed to tell you what I think completely. We're encouraged by the last few weeks including the first two weeks of Q2, but yes we got - we feel good about our merchandising offerings, we feel good about some things we're doing operationally, we certainly feel good about the strength of KS, Kirkland Signature, and traffic has improved a little bit. I remember one of the analysts reports a few months ago, was we can exhale.","We are hopefully beyond that right now. We feel that again the last - the traffic seems to hit a trough and it\u2019s come back a little, not that we expected to get back before it necessarily, but it certainly it's seems like it's back on the mend a little and we'll see. I feel we're doing a lot of good things; we got a lot of things up our sleeve in terms of merchandising, we\u2019re clearly merchandising and selling from a position of competitive strength. And fresh foods drives the business and the fact that renewal rates ex a little bit of impact from auto bill in the conversion are perfectly fine. So there\u2019s lot of good things out there and I guess I'll stop there. But overall we'll see.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then my follow-up, part of it relates to what John asked where you know the credit card benefit that could ramp. There also could be a membership pricing straight down the horizon. Thinking about what you\u2019ll reinvest versus what you drop down, I mean are you \u2013 is the investment rate being inhibited right now because you haven't had that membership price increase in a long time so or are you going to let some of these things flow to the bottom line when we get there.","Richard Galanti","First, let me go back for a minute to the monies that we've benefited from as it relates to the Citi Visa the new agreement. In theory you would say okay if you made a little more [indiscernible] did you put it back in the pricing. We're doing a lot in pricing anyway and also you don't change the reward structure every day it's a new program.","I would assume over time and this is - who knows if hypothetical but over the next couple of years if the performance of the program continues to go which we expected to do in the right direction and our piece of that action if you will versus the rewards that our members are getting, you\u2019d expect to see this change that over time. But we're way too early to even think about that.","Historically, as it relates to membership increases, we usually invest that back in the business, a lot of that in terms of competitiveness and pricing and it kind of eases in over the next several years and more fully into the bottom line notwithstanding in fact that membership fee increases take about eight fiscal quarters to get into the income statement on the membership line because of deferred accounting.","So I don't think first of all we certainly haven't done anything different. As we've seen in some examples where we do comp shops versus certain others, where that moat has gotten bigger if you will, that gap has gotten wider, we haven't said hey let's use this to get a few extra basis points of margin. We've held the course and we continued to go in that direction.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Hey, good afternoon Richard. Just want to touch back on margins with - we think about the core GPM, X the benefit from the Visa card. It was still up but maybe a little bit less than the past few quarters. If you can maybe just touch on that and then also on the SG&A, you mentioned the higher payroll and benefits but if I recall I think the second quarter last year is when you raise some wages. Is that correct and should we start to cycle some of that headwind?","Richard Galanti","On the last point, the wages, I believe the U.S. and Canada which is 80 plus percent or 80% to 83% of our company. We took the bottom of the scale up a $50 basically from 11.50 in 12 up to 13 and 13.50. I believe on an annual basis that's about a $40 million incremental increase in our pre-tax costs or about $3 million little low $3 million per month number. That started in March, so that's kind of halfway through - early the halfway through Q2 of our fiscal year that's when the annual anniversaries and that's kind of a small. I'm sorry, the first part of the question, I didn't write it down.","Paul Trussell","Just around core merchandise margins.","Richard Galanti","Yes. Keep in mind, as I try to point out on each of these calls and mentioned what was the core, roughly 80% plus of our business that is food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods. What is that margin on its own sales? And again, as I mentioned earlier in the call, that was up 17 basis points. When I look at the weighted average of what impact it had on our Company margin year-over-year. It's a lot less than 17 because there's increased penetration of another category with a lower margin or reduced penetration of another category with a higher margin and so that tends to \u2013 that's what we pointed out. We don't see just because that that 80% was 17 basis points up on that that had a much smaller effect on the year-over-year for all company.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then just when it comes to topline, Richard, obviously November was kind of a tell of two periods with the first half of the month and the second half being much better and from the comments you made around e-commerce, it sounds like there's been some strength maybe that sustained into early part of December. Just kind of what's your view right now kind of the spending levels of your core customer and as we turn the corner into 2017, what's your thoughts around kind of what our core comp expectations should be particularly in the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","Well, again, we don't know. We\u2019ll have to wait and see ourselves. We are thrilled that the first few weeks have been good. And again, November, the four weeks of November was choppy frankly, particularly the week of the election. I think it was worse than a snowstorm in terms of nobody wanting to go out and buy stuff and that\u2019s what I read about other retailers as well.","And again, over the last few months it's been a little choppy a little more in November and a little weaker and so at least, what we can tell you at this point is the first couple of weeks have been okay. And again, traffic has seemed to have stabilized until something changes there, who knows. But again, we feel good about our merchandising what's going on and one of the reasons we continue to provide monthly sales results is for that reason to keep you guys informed and that's pretty much what I can tell you at this point.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. Thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you mentioned that you signed up a million new members under the new Visa credit card arrangement. Is that above and beyond what you would normally sign up? Or is that typical with your run rate and how does that compare to your expectations?","Richard Galanti","First of all, we signed \u2013 million of our members signed up for it. Many of them could very well be existing members that historically did not have an AMEX card or historically used not a co-branded AMEX card. And they have now signed up for this because they want to sign up because the rewards, hopefully or they historically again were using debit or non co-branded AMEX card and are now switching to this. So it's not that we did not generate a million new members.","Certainly, when a new member being online or walks in and to sign up as a new member, we of course are telling them the virtues of both executive membership and these great new co-brand card.","Michael Lasser","And how are you seeing the spending patterns of those who signed up for the card or got the card versus how they're spending patterns were under the AMEX card?","Richard Galanti","It's hard to know this quickly. Generally speaking, irrespective of what credit card it is whether it's a co-branded or rewards card for an airline or hotel. Generally, we find the people on credit card spend more than by cash or check or debit. We also find the people with Executive Member spend more than non-Executive Member.","So the trifecta if you will is when they are not only a member, but they're the Executive Member and they use the co-branded card. Lots of incentives for loyalty and for spend and for capacity of the spend. And so that's what we try to do, try to do it in not too hard of a seller as you might expect.","And we've got a lot better doing the basics with it. We know existing members, by a lot historically based on their prior 12 months and it\u2019s a no-brainer to be an executive member, we make sure they know and we've done a better job of converting or getting people signed up as an executive member start with.","The credit fee, of course is not completely in our hands whether it was the 16-year relationship \u2013 40-year relationship, 40-year or 60-year relationship with American Express or the new relationship here is up to the credit card issuer in this case Citi to accept or rejected application.","Now, the ones it converted over they were all in the same deal, but anybody knew they are signing up for new card and there's going to be some people they get and some people don't. But when we do know is a million of the people that did sign up for have gotten it or approved and got it.","Michael Lasser","My follow-up question is on the prospects for import tariffs, what percentage of your goods do you import from overseas and if you could break that down between the Kirkland\u2019s brand and all other it would be very helpful?","Richard Galanti","We\u2019re just asking or being asked that question recently and we're putting some members together. Our best guess is somewhere north of 20 and south of 30 and I give you a purposely large number because even you talk to some buyers in different apartments, you find out that it might be imported, but it's all based on this U.S. dollar sale and my guess would be somewhere in the mid-20s.","Michael Lasser","Mid-20\u2019s as percentage of your total sales?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you so much and have a good night.","Richard Galanti","In the U.S., now I'm assuming that includes \u2013 I'm including in that like electronics. Most electronics are purchased in U.S. dollars by U.S. trading companies that are arms of the overseas manufacture. And so again it's a little tenuous to come up with an exact number particularly since we just started looking at it.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital.","Kelly Bania","Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask a different question about gross margin, it\u2019s still if you look at the core gross margin I think you set up 17 basis points still very strong, but I think it's been in the 10 basis point to 15 basis point range. I know you\u2019ve talked about online, organics some of the higher margin categories in the mix shift there, is just curious if those are really still some of the same drivers or if there's anything else going on there particularly as online seem to slow a little bit this quarter?","Richard Galanti","I think part of it is as prices have deflated there are instances where we could make a little more, but not a lot more where others have not deflated them as much even though we're going to be the first to take it down and more there's still a little there on the table. Private label helps. I think those are the kinds of things and we've also in terms of driving business, working with our vendors to lower the price and drive more business. And we will participate in it, but we\u2019ll still make a little more.","So there's lots of little reasons and again I'd be remiss to say, I mean year-over-year, we had just under a basis point and shrink recovery, in other words better shrink number, inventory shrinkage numbers. We don't talk about it because I mean good news is continues to improve a little for 30 years essentially. We were doing a better job of operating our businesses and controlling our inventories, but it's lots of little things.","Kelly Bania","That's helpful. And then just another big picture question, lots of questions on the savings and how you would think about possibly maybe reinvesting some of that over the years, but as I hear you online and proving that experience to check out experience to search, do you look at ways to just make things more convenient for your members? Is there anything else you think about on the convenience front versus just the price front?","Richard Galanti","I got to tell you, a little tongue-in-cheek here, but we arguably were little \u2013 have been \u2013 many years ago we like it to even do e-commerce, did a little bit begrudgingly, it took a while to do some more things. I think the things that we're doing offensively not defensively, but we're also probably a little stubborn along the way to suggest \u2013 there are some extreme examples of when a member orders a big ticket item electronics or light goods or whatever and the delivery window is much larger than anyone else's.","They'd like to know it pops up the calendar and here it goes. When they want to return it that process was not very good. And some of these are quick fixes, search was not very good. That's been a quick fix to get a significant improvement and we get some more improvement.","So I think that we're doing some things to that we've notwithstanding decent sales. We're investing in better [indiscernible], but by the way that's not at the expense of we want to take our prices down a little and those are truly independent whether it's IT modernization efforts some of which was in necessarily or you know what are we going to do with regard to we need another 10 million or 50 million or whatever to enhance the site, that is truly independent of what we're doing there.","We know as Jim said it will set for 25 plus years and [indiscernible] is set for now five plus years. We are clearly a topline Company and we're best when we drive sales. We probably aren't as good at leveraging expenses when sales come down than others because we\u2019re not going to do some things, but we're clearly taking the offense. Again there is some things that perhaps we should've done earlier but we're already seeing some improvement in that we know that will help.","Kelly Bania","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Sean Carson","Hi, Richard, this is Sean Carson for Karen. Thanks for taking our questions. Can you talk about your outlook for deflation and any signs of leveling off or maybe even an upswing?","Richard Galanti","I'm sorry, I couldn\u2019t hear the question.","Sean Carson","Sure. Sorry about that. Can you talk about your outlook for deflation and any signs for potentially leveling off or potentially an upswing?","Richard Galanti","When we talk with different category buyers probably the ones that have more specific insider on the fresh foods size because they're dealing with commodities and negotiating they're actually looking at the futures contracts and more of the cost is the actual item, the orange or the poultry or the pork or whatever.","Whereas sometimes that's not the case, I think usually when we ask there's another three months to six months whatever. And when it gets to the anniversarying of it, there\u2019s been some huge swings, some huge example of swings on some nuts which last year doubled and we\u2019re now down 35%. There's you know eggs of course are down well over 60% year-over-year.","So if eggs were down even 50% it doesn't mean that people going to eat twice as many eggs to have flat sales. They're going to eat some more eggs, but not that many. So by the way a few of those things may help in the bakery, the margins of the bakery. We\u2019re going to - also not going to change the package the cost of 16 muffins or 15 muffins.","So overall, I think the feeling has given that the last few months have been a little more deflationary. The view is that it's another few months of that, but they all believe that it's going to come back the other way and this is a lot of estimated semi-educated guesses among different departments.","Sean Carson","And so I noticed there's also no LIFO reserve, apparently there is no charge or credit in the quarter. Is that right?","Richard Galanti","Right. That's correct.","Sean Carson","Okay. Thanks for that.","Richard Galanti","By the way as effective the beginning of this fiscal year for 30 years we've been on our retail cost systems, retail inventory system. Most companies historically have been on a cost base system where you can get down more granularly to item level with the modernization that was part of this process too. With a cost system the way you value inventories will not have LIFO charges and credits in the future.","Unidentified Company Representative","[Inaudible]","Richard Galanti","At the beginning of the year you'll notice on our year-end balance sheet. We revalued the inventory at cost in a different way and it was about a $60 million plus reduction in inventory. At the beginning of the year but not a P&L impact.","Sean Carson","Got it. Okay.","Richard Galanti","To the extent there's inflation in the future, we will have a LIFO charge. I'm giving myself a thumb up. And once you have some LIFO charges, you can have credits. To the extent that there was LIFO as deflation right out of the box. You won't take that credit because you have no charge against to which you can take it.","Sean Carson","Got it. All right. That explains it. Thanks for that. And just my follow-up is just an extra week this year. Can you give us a sense of the impact? I think my math was about $0.10 to $0.11, but curious if you think that\u2019s sort of the right vicinity.","Richard Galanti","Well, it sounds like that's 2% of X. I don't have a calculator in front of me, [150 third] of a year. For the most part, most expenses even though say on a rental facility, you pay 12 monthly rents; we take it over the 53 weeks. I mean you don\u2019t get a [150 third] credit for that. We amortize it over the course of the 10 years or 20 years. And so there's not a lot of \u2013 it generally should be if it's 2% more weeks, it\u2019s 2% more earnings.","Sean Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, Richard. My first question relates to the Citibank Visa deal. Can you tell what impact the enhanced cashback features have led to? Has it been in your view more sign ups, has Citi seen more traction with some of the categories where you increase the incentives for consumers?","Richard Galanti","Well, I can't speak for Citi. To you I can't speak to them. But we certainly have discussion with them, but they\u2019ve made their own comments that I think we are generally positive about how the program is working so far for them. What I can tell you from our perspective is some of things I already mentioned in terms of \u2013 look it's a significant improvement in the value proposition of the reward to the members assuming they spend like they did.","Hopefully, they'll spend more because of the 2% at Costco instead of 1% on top of executive rewards, the 4% on gas instead of 3% and 3% on velocity categories instead of 2%, so all that stuff is good. There's more utilization, there\u2019s more places to use the card. Typically these are smaller merchants that only perhaps accept certain brands over others, they pay higher fees, but we\u2019ll have to see.","Matthew Fassler","Are there any surveys you\u2019ve conducted that would suggest customers have really digested that extra penny they're going to get back at the end of the year?","Richard Galanti","No.","Matthew Fassler","Okay.","Richard Galanti","What I can tell you from talking to our Head of Membership marketing is it stands out in good print on everybody's monthly statement, they see it and it\u2019s pretty big pretty, pretty fast. And so I think those are the types of things that people look at. We know if any programs work. And again, based on Citi\u2019s comments, publicly it seems like it\u2019s working in the right direction for everyone which means more spend on it.","Matthew Fassler","Great. And then my follow-up is on deflation and gross margin, we've looked through your transcripts going back quite a while and this is a period I think a remarkable deflation particularly in the context of a decent U.S. economy. In your experience, how those gross margin progress through a deflationary cycle? You talked about your expectations for when if and when deflation turns and number of months going forward et cetera. But in the past as you've seen food prices in particular recover, how do your gross margins tend to behave?","Richard Galanti","Really is all over the board. I mean with inflation the dollars go up, the percent probably changes a little downwards, so that would imply perhaps a little bit of improvement in dollars, but it could be all over the board. Gas is an extreme example; it is a low margin competitive business. As prices tumbled dramatically across general competition, prices were lower, but not nearly proportional to the amount of savings to that retailer.","We were able to improve our margins little and widen the gap that's a win-win. Another silly example is organics. Organics because there's perhaps a little bit of less price sensitive \u2013 elasticity to organic prices. We are able to make a little more margin not a lot and have a wider value proposition versus others, so those are good things for us.","Generally speaking, when there was cost inflation on milk and cheese and things like that, we would point out as you know historically some of those quarters were we kept the chicken at 499 and margins went down essentially from something to nothing to the tune of $40 million a year on one item that was four, five years ago \u2013 four years ago.","Conversely, when cheese prices fell, food court margins went up nicely because we've always \u2013 we never really change the price of a slice of pizza. So there's lots of little things that don't fit in a square box or \u2013 a square box or round hole here. I would say generally a little inflation is good, it help sales and we could be more competitive both up and down. And when price is going up, probably is a little bit more margin beneficial.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much. I appreciate it. Thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, Richard. Thanks. What are your thoughts regarding bricks plus clicks and whether that would be by online pick up in store, reserve in store, car pick up from store because we're just seeing a lot of innovation as retailers in pure plays go into physical retail that are previously digital, so I want to know what\u2019s you think about that and if it's meaningful for you and if we should be concerned about your long-term store traffic trends with the rise in Amazon. And then mobile is about two-thirds of online traffic from many retailers, what should we expect for your mobile app in the five-year plan for what you want to do there to make it really exciting and fun and great?","Richard Galanti","Well first, we're fixing some of the basics and improving some of the basics and I'm pretty excited about some of those things. You mentioned a number of mobile versus non-mobile e-commerce sales. Our numbers are lower than that mobile, but they're improving quickly. Again, we\u2019ve recognized those things that we can and can't do. We think that we could and should do a lot more online, but we also as you pointed out want to get people into the warehouses.","We think that some of the things that we do in store will keep them coming. So far it's not been an issue and even \u2013 while we try to point out these things each quarter in terms of traffic, in terms of even when traffic was impact a little bit, we\u2019re asked that $64,000 question is it all these other things. We see some of the categories that one would think would have been impacted negatively by it aren't being impacted negatively.","In terms of click and pick up, we've looked at it and we are not prepared to do that at this point. When we see it in other places not just the other warehouse club, you need space for it or you need a lot less volume in the location for it neither of which we have and we're not getting a lot of demands for it.","We do that at business centers. You can log on and get it delivered and so that's more for the business member not the individual. And we recognize that we're not the retailer, they're going to sell you a smaller pack size or something and even a little bit higher margin. That's not what we do. Now time will tell over time, there's a lot of things that are going on out there. We're looking at them. We've all seen the video from earlier this week about you just walk in.","There's a lot of other brick and mortars that my guess would be far more impacted than us on that, but we'll have to wait and see. Again, we're going to \u2013 if renewal rates trends changed \u2013 by the way we\u2019ve been seeing the markets where we've done things with Google and where we work with Instacart as well. Google Express and Instacart are probably the most extreme example would be the bay area where we started with Google and that was their first market and certainly that's where they're headquartered.","And it's doing fine what we found is an existing loyal member is coming in a few less times a year and shopping several more times plus certainly several more because it was zero. We are shopping more, but some of the two is more. They buy a lot less when they are doing it online when they come in and part of that is the experience of [walking in and seasonal there] even if not everything is offered, but [indiscernible]. So the good news is [Technical Difficulty].","Operator","You\u2019re live Mr. Galanti.","Richard Galanti","Thank you. Hi, Oliver, yes.","Oliver Chen","Thanks for answering that. I just wanted to briefly ask you, does scan and go make sense for you or is that something that's not conducive to your experience. And then as you do your own research on Amazon which categories or what would you say like try out your best competitive advantages and what are your opportunities just to make sure you remain very competitive against Amazon and how are you feeling about millennials and generation Z. It sounded like you still had a lot of good momentum with younger demographics?","Richard Galanti","Well, look in terms of scan and go honestly we did a version of scan go literally 20 years ago a customer I remember walk in get an RF gun, radio frequency device walk around scan their own items come up to the front hand that thing to the cashier and the scanner and they print out a receipt. Needless to say, there's a lot more efficient things today. We continue to look at scan and go type things, we are not testing it currently but we are looking at it.","And I\u2019m not suggesting we are going to do it. We have done self checkout for a while. We've chosen to not do self checkout and higher volume units because we get people through without it. And as it relates \u2013 in terms of millennials and generation Z all those numbers are doing better for us and part of it is things like not that we set down and strategic - how do we get them. We have a great value proposition certainly some of the things that we sell like organics in my view is a big impact to that.","Certainly some of the things we do you know we've done a couple of tests with LivingSocial over the last couple of years. All those things, we think help. As it relates you asked question about Amazon and Amazon is also the word for everything out there that's delivered or dot com and everything else it's certainly they\u2019re doing a lot of things. We want to make sure we understand what all of these people are doing. We do not just from a competitive price shop and whether it's them or someone else.","We recognize convenience is a value but there\u2019s also some things that we can and can't do. So I think that we're looking at these things offensively not defensively at this point. I don't think that I think we're encouraged when we see the level of millennials if you will that are signing up and we see the average age of our membership coming down. Now you know it was just a couple years ago when the average U.S. Costco adult member was four plus years older than the population as a whole now it's a little under two.","And that's without a lot of planning but it's what we do and I think part of that's the merchandise selection and our ability to change merchandise pretty quickly and certainly things like again organic standout in a big way. I think the fact of what we're doing even on some things that aren't directly; they\u2019re all related to the business but ESG and sustainability how we take care of our employees, the culture.","Those are things that, again, we didn\u2019t say we have to do better at that. We do best at that, we do a lot of good things like that. When it comes down to merchandising, we believe that organics, the KS, what we're very good at is driving value and we're probably not going to be the person that's the best of delivering smaller size goods to your house. There are some things we're going to do between that and nothing and again stay tuned for calendar 2017.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. Happy holidays. Best Regards.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Binder","Yes, hi. Good afternoon. My question was around some of the things you\u2019ve already covered including pricing and the moat that you said is opened up. And in light of that there's been a lot of debate around the traffic just north of 2% or just under 3% depending on the months and lot of questions around convenience.","And I just wonder as you review this online strategy, do you think there needs to be a major shift towards a broader SKU assortment, obviously Amazon's got marketplace, Wal-Mart is building marketplace, targets chosen not to. Do you think as part of that convenience factor Costco just needs to materially up their SKU count online?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind we have materially upped it over the last couple of years. Recognizing it's still a fraction of anything else out there. If we were again at 3,700 active items in a physical location and roughly that many online excluding like office products which is through a third-party and there's several thousand of those items, but in terms of what we do ourselves and we now taken it up to 8-ish, 8,000 maybe a little more.","Is it likely to go to 40,000 or 50,000? Absolutely not. Unless it does one-day, but I don't think so. And is it like you go up a little bit more? Sure. And is it likely for us to do a few more things that provide convenience? Yes, but we still want you in the door. And again to Amazon and others credit, they\u2019re trying a lot of things. Some will work and some won't and we're pretty good at understanding what works and figure out how to augment and to do what we know how to do and what we want to do. And we recognized that we can't be \u2013 sell you a smaller size or something and our margins nor we prepared to double or triple the margin to do so.","Daniel Binder","Got it. My other question was around the membership fee or potential membership fee increase, next year that's been talked about quite a bit. I'm just curious if there's a sensitivity and what that threshold is, at which point you would not do it. In other words, if the comp store sales were to continue being at the level that they were at in the first quarter, would you be less likely to put it increase through and maybe an easier way to talk about it is what kind of comp level would you like to be at when you do it?","Richard Galanti","Directionally, I responded in the past by saying if comps were a little weaker, it would be more likely to want to do it or no impact on that decision. It's all in our view about what additional values that we brought to the table. Whatever amount of an increase might be contemplated, have we improved the value proposition significantly greater in that amount which is in my view is always been a no-brainer for us. Our renewal rate is okay and if sales are a little weak, it would be the time to do it \u2013 not do it. I'm not trying to suggest that it\u2019s tomorrow afternoon, I'm just saying that generally speaking a little bit weaker we're going to use that to drive business.","Daniel Binder","Okay. I guess my question, my response to that is, if you had this widening mode in place and you are priced right. This idea that you would reinvest membership fee dollars into price, do you think that would drive an incremental gain to get comps at a higher level?","Richard Galanti","On some items, yes, on some of things that we do. If you keep in mind, 30 years ago, the original business for 33 years ago, the original business plan and talked about it. It doesn't matter where you locate. You could be on the other side of the railroad tracks and in downtrodden area people come to you, it\u2019s a destination.","And that was fine until you add into that sentence until somebody is between you and your customer. And over time while we\u2019re certainly not at the mall, we recognized that we have to do something. So what we're doing online right now with some of the member experience and distributions, timing and costs and capabilities. Those are the types of things that we are investing in.","Vertical integration and some aspects whether it's the chicken plant or bakery commissary in Canada. There's a lot of things that we're doing to drive value not just lower the price, but I don't \u2013 yes, I don't see it that being a reason to do it or not to do it. We look at it as a \u2013 it's a value proposition. We may become a little \u2013 price is primary and I think it will continue to be primary if we look at a few other things as well.","Daniel Binder","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert Ohmes","Thanks. Hey, Richard. Hey, you mentioned going into Iceland and France and I know you guys are doing Kirkland on Tmall in China. Can you just maybe sketch us up on when you might ponder opening brick and mortar up in the Mainland China? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, on Tmall I think it\u2019s about 300 items about a little over half of which are Kirkland Signature, so it\u2019s certainly the cast name is getting known and that's a positive. We've continued to look at it for a number of years. Is it in the next couple of three years? It's probably more likely to say yes to that than two years ago or five years ago, but there's nothing definite at this point.","Robert Ohmes","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the credit card. Is there any \u2013 the new sign ups for the card, anything on the demographic side of who is signing up that's different than what you were seeing with AMEX card?","Richard Galanti","No. Not at all. I mean, they are called millennials instead of something else now, but that\u2019s no.","Robert Ohmes","Got it. All right. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird.","Peter Benedict","Thanks. Couple of quick ones. First, just on the Google Express, can you just talk about are there any plans to expand that. I know you mentioned the Bay area, but we\u2019re hoping that being done or any thoughts to moving that out?","Richard Galanti","Start of the Bay area, but then with LA area and in the last couple years is expanded to as well Chicago, Boston, New York and D.C. I believe they're expanding and we're expanding is a few other markets as well. I believe I don't have that list in front of me, but I know it includes a few more. So let's say it's going from 6-ish to 12-ish plus and now recognizing we're working with them in different markets, testing different things. I think we've done a couple of small tests with some fresh foods, but it's a limited selection of items and each of these are little different.","Peter Benedict","Sure. I understood. On tobacco is that \u2013 is the weakness in tobacco - does that have any kind of a material effect on a core gross margin, I understand that\u2019s a very low margin for that product?","Richard Galanti","Well, it's a low margin business so it would help improve the margin a little bit.","Peter Benedict","I mean is that a material benefit to your core margins right now or is it\u2026","Richard Galanti","No. Gas would be an offset to that in a bigger way in my view.","Peter Benedict","Okay. And then last just on capital allocation. Remind us kind of what your thoughts there in terms of priorities in a way that you on leverage \u2013 some of your leverage ratios to get down for the next year so what your thought there? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well, first and far most CapEx is expansion and expansion is not \u2013 first and far most new units or the improvements in existing units a little bit, but probably an equal priority is all the things associated with it ancillary businesses, whether it's gas stations or as well as some of the manufacturing things we're doing. We're opening up a second \u2013 we\u2019ve had it for a number of years a B plan in Tracy, California.","That does I think around 200 million pounds a year 4 plus million pounds a week of four or five items that are us. It's our items. We're opening B plan on the east coast shortly. In Canada, we're building. I think we've broken ground on a commissary for bakery. We are investing 250 million plus and closer to 300 million on a big chicken plant, processing plant in Nebraska. That is not broken ground yet, but it\u2019s in the process of getting permits and stuff.","And so there's things like that as well. We're still spending money in IT, but priority-wise none of this stuff impacts what we're doing for expansion. We're expanding as much as we want you know we try to be - we look at our dividend every year you know historically it's been about 13% plus increase year-over-year for the last nine years or 10 years since its inception in 2005.","We buyback a little stock, in terms of leverage you know arguably some would say that we are - I would say we're well capitalized, I would say we're under levered. We've got $1.1 billion 10-year fixed rate debt instrument that comes due in March 2017. The good news is that, it\u2019s got that low, low fixed rate of about I don't have it in front of me - about 5.5%. What we do in terms of whether writing a check for it or refinancing part of it, we\u2019ll see. So no big changes of what we do. We\u2019ve done a couple of special dividends, one in late 2012 and one in early 2015 and I'm not indicating if we are \u2013 we are into the future that was something that we chose to do it at that time.","Peter Benedict","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Melich","Three quick ones. Of the 15% of people that haven't activated the card, what are those people using? Are they using other Visa in their wallet? What can you tell us about their behavior? Are they coming less frequently or using cash or what are they doing?","Richard Galanti","Well a bunch of them it's between 11% and 15%. But a bunch of them is, are people that it was not active as a co-brand AMEX card. We had about 15% that had not \u2013 upon conversion about 15% of the 11% or whatever million people in the 7.5 million or so accounts about - just under 15% of them had not been using the prior two months I believe, the prior 60 days. And not to suggest that may be some of them just hadn\u2019t used it and they will use it or they\u2019ve been out of town or whatever else.","It's every answer on this - and I think the vast majority of would be that, though, they were using something else in their wallet. And to the extent that the membership card was on the back, they still have it in their wallet and they still have to do it in their wallet and hopefully they see those giant signs and they reminded the cash register by the cashier and have you heard about the 4321 or the new exciting warranty program on electronic, on TVs where you get a four-year free warranty if you use it at Costco.","Gregory Melich","All right. Any other ads you want to put out there, or we will leave it at that?","Richard Galanti","I thought I would do that just I didn't have it in my script.","Gregory Melich","That\u2019s great. So then the second question is on international, so that's an area that as traffic has been running below the U.S. now for a while which has been kind of unusual to look over the last few years. Could you give us some insight as to why that is and how that's behaving maybe in the markets where you raised the fee, is it linked to that? Or renewal rates doing okay in those markets where the fee went up?","Richard Galanti","It's mostly cannibalization. We've got a $200 million, $300 million business. You open up a second one in that Citi. The new one does 100 to 100 in a quarter or 100 to 150 and 75 of its bled. Let\u2019s say your traffic number is the old unit that's being cannibalized, so on the basis of 10 or 12 units that\u2019s the biggest single reason.","Gregory Melich","And on the markets where the fee went up.","Richard Galanti","There is probably a little bit of softness in Japan beyond that. And I can't say you why and other than \u2013 the economy has been tough there, but it rains on everybody.","Gregory Melich","And in terms of the markets where the fee went up, what have renewal rates done in those markets?","Richard Galanti","I am sorry.","Gregory Melich","What have renewal rates done in the markets where the fee was increased?","Richard Galanti","Well, it just happened three months ago. We don't have any numbers yet, but it's de minimis of anything. And that's why I actually asked our marketing people earlier today [indiscernible]. Bob has made a good point. It takes about six months to know because you've got people not every member comes in every two weeks. So trend wise we don't see any big issue there at all.","Gregory Melich","Fair enough. Good luck.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Grey. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","Hello Richard. Just a quick question about what you're seeing in Visa usage from people who are using \u2013 who never were AMEX card, Costco AMEX cardholders and how they're spending behavior is changed or somehow affected by Costco accepting Visa's payment now?","Richard Galanti","It's up. Particularly somebody \u2013 to the extent somebody is choosing to use another Visa card in his or her wallet. Maybe it\u2019s airline program or hotel program. They may not be spending more because nothing is changed in their wallet. To the extent that they are using cash or debit that's you see an increase and we have seen that as we would have expected.","Chuck Cerankosky","Are you seeing any related impact on membership? Are you able to see if new members are being generated by the Visa acceptance?","Richard Galanti","Well, we know that's the case to a small extent though, Citi for example is done marketing activities in their branches, but it's more existing members that it converted and you'll get a few \u2013 few could be in the tens of thousands, but out of a million couple or 20,000, 30,000, 40,000 is not a big piece of that.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today's press release, we reported operating results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks ended February 18th, as well as February retail sales for the four weeks ended this past Sunday, March 4th. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $701 million or $1.59 a share, a 36% increase compared to last year's second quarter results of $515 million or $1.17 a share. This year's earnings per share included $0.17 due to a net income tax benefit of $74 million as a result of the tax legislation recently passed by Congress. Excluding this benefit, net income grew by 22% year-over-year.","This afternoon, I'll start by reviewing our Q2 operating results. Beginning with sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $32.3 billion, a 10.8% increase over the $29.1 billion of sales during the second quarter of last fiscal year. This year's 12 week second quarter included one additional sales day in the United States versus last year due to the shift of Thanksgiving. But while we gained the sales day in the quarter, our pre-Thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell in the first quarter this year compared to the second quarter last year. Combined these two factors negatively impacted second quarter sales results by an estimated 1.4% in the U.S. and slightly less worldwide, somewhere at or about 1%, 1.1%. The shift also negatively impacted ecommerce sales results by an estimated minus 7 to minus 8 percentage points in the second quarter.","Recall that in Q1 we had an estimated 10% improvement relative to the shift in ecommerce. I think if you look at the 24 week fiscal year-to-date comparable sales results in our earnings release, it essentially eliminates the impact from the holiday shift altogether. Now for the second quarter 12 week comparable sales results, in the U.S. we reported a 7.1% increase ex-gas and FX, 5.7%, and then we\u2019d estimate these add to 1.4 back for the switch in the holiday. Canada 8.7% reported and 2.5% ex-gas and FX, other international reported 15.7%, 7.4% ex-gas and FX. So total company would be an 8.4% reported and 5.4% ex-gas and FX, a little over 1% of impact -- negative impact on that 5.4% from the Thanksgiving shift. E-commerce reported was 28.5% comp sales, 27.3% ex-gas and FX, and again we estimate that 27.3% was hit by about 7 to 8 percentage points related to the holiday shift, so something little over 30 ex-that.","In terms of Q2 sales metrics, second quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 3.7% worldwide and 3.4% in the U.S. Also, these numbers are negatively impacted by the Thanksgiving holiday shift as I just discussed. In terms of the impact on FX and gas for the company FX assuming flat currency relative to the U.S. dollar over the last year, that impacted sales, the strengthening in foreign currencies impacted sales by approximately 180 basis points positive, and gas inflation contributed another 125 basis points, so together about 3 percentage points.","Cannibalization weighted on the comp to the tune of 55 basis points to the negative. Our average front end transaction or ticket was up 4.6% in the quarter, excluding the net benefits from gas inflations and strong foreign currencies relative to the dollar it was up a little over 1.5%. Our February sales results were also reported in sales release. I'll review these results at the end of the call.","Moving down the income statement for the second quarter, there is membership income is the next line item. I reported in Q2 $716 million, up $80 million from the $636 million last year second quarter and up about 4 basis points or 12.6% in dollars. Now FX, the benefit of strong foreign currencies benefit the number by about $12 million. Of the $80 million increase in membership fees increased year-over-year about $37 million related to membership fee increases. The majority of the $37 million came from fee increases taken last year in first U.S. and Canada with the smaller balances from the fee increases taken in our other international operations starting back in September of 2016. So all told, if you take out both of those, we would on a normalize basis membership fees were up $31 million or about 5%.","In terms of renewal rates, our renewal rates improved in Q2 to 90.1% in the U.S. and Canada, up from 90% a quarter earlier and worldwide improved to 87.3% as of Q2 end, up 20% from the 87.2% at Q1 end. I think the most important thing here of course is the trends we\u2019ve seen with the conversion of the credit card over the last year and half in the U.S. and slightly overlapping that prior to that in Canada and happy to see that what we expected came through there and seen a slight improvement now.","In terms of members in Q2 end. At Q2 end, we had 39.6 million Gold Star members, up from 39.3 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary business were 7.5 million both quarter end. Business add-ons, which was 3.2 million at Q1 end and at Q3 end was 3.3 million. So total member households 49.9 million at Q1 end, up to 50.4 million at Q1 end. Total cardholders at 92.2 million at the end of the quarter, up from 91.5 million 12 weeks earlier.","During the quarter, we only had one opening. At Q2 end paid executive member were 18.8 million, an increase of about 46,000 from the second quarter end or about 4,000 a week. A little softer than it had been in recent quarters. When we look at the quarter ago, it started off quite a bit weaker and I\u2019m happy to say the last several weeks have been in the high-teens low-20s on average per week.","Lastly, in terms of the portion of membership fee increases related to the recent fee increases, that year-over-year quarterly membership fee increase will continue to grow each fiscal quarter this year and into fiscal \u201919 given the deferred accounting treatment as to when it benefits our income statement. The year-over-year increase will peak in Q4 of this fiscal year. So the $37 million Q2 increase related to that will increase in Q3 and increase again in Q4 based on the P&L on deferred accounting. And so have again smaller increases but in the next couple of three quarters after that into \u201919.","Going down the gross margin line, our reporting gross margin came in at 10.98% or 2 basis points lower year-over-year. On a reported basis that minus 2 basis points, it was actually plus 11 basis points excluding gas and FX. Within that I\u2019ll have you just jab down the two columns with the four, five members in each column first column would be as reported and the second column wihtout gas inflation. The core merchandise on a reported basis was year-over-year down 20 basis points, down 8 basis points without gas inflation. Ancillary businesses up 23 basis points in the quarter and up 25 ex-gas inflation. 2% reward plus 1 and zero in those two columns, and other minus 6 and minus 6 basis points. So all told, if you add up column one the reported year-over-year gross margin change was the minus 2 basis points and ex-gas inflation was plus 11.","If we look at -- as I've done in the past, if you look at the core merchandize categories in relation to their own sales, even though again on ex-gas inflation basis, the core has contributed to the total company was minus 8. If you look at core categories on core sales, margins year-over-year in Q2 were higher by 14 basis points. Subcategories within core margins year-over-year in Q2, food sundries, hard lines and fresh foods were up, soft lines was down a little. Notwithstanding greater all of these improvements and notwithstanding greater values for our members as we continue to do it.","Ancillary and other businesses gross margin up 23% basis points and 25 ex-gas inflation. Gas represented a little more than half of that improvement, it's both the combination of these higher sales penetration and improved margins within the business. With hearing aids, pharmacy, optical business centers and travel all showing higher year-over-year gross margins and that contributed to that number as well. 2% reward again essentially at gas. Lastly in other as was the case with the first quarter, we were incurring incremental cost related to the rollout of our new centralized returns facilities. And this will continue to impact us as I said last quarter and each in the next few quarters, likely a little less each quarter and it was a down a basis point this time from 7 to minus 6. And long term, we believe it's a big benefit to us.","Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was lower or better by 21 basis points and better by 9 basis points plus 9 basis points ex-gas inflation coming in at the 10.02% of sales this year compared to 10.23% on a reported basis. And again the two columns reported and without gas inflation. The first line item would be operations plus 19 basis points and plus 8 basis points ex-gas inflation, central minus 1 basis points and minus 2 basis points, stock compensation plus 3 basis points at each column and then total, plus 21 basis points or lower better by 21 basis points on a reported basis, and ex-gas inflation better by 9 basis points.","Not a whole lot of unusual items here. The core operations component again was better by ex-gas inflation, strong top-line sales we believe led the year-over-year improvement in payroll, benefits and other traditional expenses like utilities and maintenance. Central expense higher by couple of basis points ex-gas. We've got a lot going on. Stock compensation better year-over-year by 3 basis points again strong sales and usually that's the number that's most impacting Q1 when we do the big grant every year.","Next on the income statement is preopening expenses. They were better or lower by $3 million in Q2 this year they were $12 million, last year $15 million. Now again, this year we only opened one new unit. Last year, we opened four. However, we also have quite a bit of preopening related to two big manufacturing plants that we -- one we just opened and one under construction. A new meat plant in the Midwest as well as our major new chicken plant in the Nebraska that's under construction.","All told reporting operating income for Q2 came in at $1.16 billion, up $172 million or 20% higher year-over-year from last year's $844 million number. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at plus $6 million -- at $6 million higher year-over-year that $37 million this year compared to $31 million a year ago, primarily a result of last year's debt offering. Interest income and other was better year-over-year by $11 million in the quarter. Actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year by $5 million also benefiting this line item is the year-over-year comparison was various FX items, mostly various FX items in the amount of positive $6 million.","Overall, pretax earnings were higher by 22% or $177 million higher in Q2 coming in at $986 million this year compared to $809 million last year the same quarter. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the second quarter came in at 27.7% for the quarter compared to 35.6% last year. Of course, the lower tax rate for Q2 this year its results of tax law changes. The primary benefit was the result of the lowering in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Given that our fiscal -- we don\u2019t have a calendar year and it doesn\u2019t line with calendar year. You take the number of days in each in our fiscal year, which fall before or after December 31st. In our case, it's a blended U.S. federal rate 35% for 119 days of the fiscal year and 21% at the remaining 245 days of the fiscal year, again an average of 25.58%.","The impact of that lower rate on Q2 pretax income was $52 million of the $72 million I just mentioned -- the $74 million I just mentioned. The other $22 million is basically two main things. One is a true up of Q2 -- of Q1 recognizing in Q1 we assumed we had no reason to assume this much lower federal income tax rate, so turning up for the first quarter so that were in tune for the whole year.","The other piece is some positives and some offsets to that relating to various things that have come with the new tax legislation. Also the net impact of these items in Q2 was an additional $22 million benefit tax benefit. So total tax benefit in Q2 of $74 million. The $52 million what I\u2019ll call normalized to Q2 the $22 million related to turning up Q1 and other offsets that go along with the original change in tax laws.","Going forward, we anticipate that the effective companywide rate for the balance of \u201818 in Q3 and Q4 will be probably in the 29.5% to 30% range and in fiscal \u201819 based on what we currently know and of course all that subject to change is approximately, we assume it will be approximately 28% plus or minus. As we know more and we\u2019ll share it with you.","Overall, the reported net income was higher by 36%, coming in at $701 million in Q2 compared to the $515 million last year. Again up 22% ex the tax benefits I just spoke about. Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, a few comments as to what our plans are vis-\u00e0-vis the savings. Overall, one, we do not expect any major changes to our capital allocations plans. We\u2019re generally net positive cash flow operator notwithstanding CapEx and dividends and what have you.","Number two, as many others have done, we will use some of these savings to benefit our employees, we\u2019re working on that and stay tuned. Number three, we\u2019ll invest some of the savings to drive to continue to drive greater value to our members. This will certainly include investing in price, as well as other activities. And number four, when asked and we have been, if any of these tax savings will fall to the bottom line, the answer is yes. Most importantly, indirectly by investing and driving value, we\u2019ve seen what that does and we know what that does and much of that investing in value and price comes back in greater earnings. And directly, perhaps a little but again stay tuned.","A few others items of note, warehouse expansion. As I mentioned, we opened only one unit in Q2 that\u2019s top of five net to use in Q1. Our plans for the current quarter, which will end in mid-May is two more. And then Q4 is the big quarter, it\u2019s a 16-week quarter but we plan to open net 15 units, 18 openings including three. Assuming we got there, we had 23 net openings for the year and I guess it\u2019ll 22 or 23. A little better than I think, I mentioned a quarter ago, but somewhere in those low-20s.","For all of \u201918 again, we expect to open something around 22 or 23 with three quarters of those in the next two quarters and most of it in the fourth quarter. As of Q2 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 108 million square feet.","In terms of stock buybacks, in all of fiscal 2017, we expanded $473 million purchasing just under 3 million shares at an average price of just under $158. In the first quarter, we expanded as mentioned $190 million at an average price of about $162.5. And this quarter just ended we expanded an additional $59 million at an average price of 187.7 per share. For now for an update on ecommerce business. We currently operate ecommerce sites in U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Total ecommerce sales for the second quarter came in at $1.5 billion, up 29% year-over-year.","Overall, our ecommerce sales increases continue at very strong levels. If you look back in Q1, ex-FX, it was positive 42.1% again there was a chunk in there that related to the benefit of the Thanksgiving holiday shift in Q2, 27.3% as I just mentioned ex-FX. Adding the first half together, again taking out the Thanksgiving shift there. First half all together was plus 33.7% and in February as you saw in the press release and I\u2019ll talk about February overall in a minute came in at 37%. So continued very strong sales growth momentum in these numbers.","We continue to prove our offerings and we continue to be up by improved member experience with better search checkout and return to processes that I\u2019ve shared so that equity in the past. In the quarter, our site traffic and conversation rates and orders were up nicely year-over-year. Our warehouses are supporting costco.com with signage and tablets in the store. We now have that in the 195 U.S. buildings and that\u2019s used to help search and purchase costco.com items for members in the warehouses. We continue to capture more email addresses.","In addition, our improved content is resulting an increase in our open rated emails again driving traffic both in store and online. If you go right now to costco.com, I think it talks about hot buys. And you\u2019ll see that some of them are in warehouse only as supplies last and we think that we\u2019ve got some excitement going here in terms of driving traffic both specifically in store using the Internet and emails as well as driving traffic online. A great example that is again you can look for yourself with these hot buys in the warehouse.","Online grocery, both our dry grocery two day delivery and our same day fresh delivery food cart. As I mentioned the last quarter rolled down in early October has been quite positive year-to-date and growing. We\u2019re just starting to do some limited marketing instant cart now is in 441 of our U.S. warehouses and should be in most of the remainder our U.S. warehouses by calendar year end. We continue to improve the online merchandise and services offerings. Again with not only in general but hot buys. We\u2019ve improved our apparel offerings. We\u2019re doing better job of focusing and adding items that are complementary to our warehouse offerings. We\u2019re doing some great things with some big ticket seasonal items where we might be out of them given date or start them at a certain date in store, but online we get for greater availability of those. And then we're doing some other exciting things. Currently, there is over 100 high-end beauty items online.","In Q1 '18, we added the 2% reward to all travel purchases through Costco Travel that\u2019s something we have not done in the past that's a few -- to our executive members, as well if you use your Costco Visa card, cobranded card, you get 3% that way, so it will be 5% off with what\u2019s already great values and see growth in Costco Travel. As I think I mentioned last time in the call, we're offering a very limited buy online pick up in store. These are really basically selected small sized big ticket items where many people aren't likely to want to leave them at their doorstep. So some jewelry, tablets and laptops and most recently handbags, all these things are driving shops in store. Over half the people that are doing this are shopping in store women there. But again, this is limited this is -- we'll continue to see how it works.","All these efforts that I just mentioned are having a positive impacts on our business, both online and in warehouse. And that we believe it helps for the sales momentum and increased awareness of our digital presence, as well as the traffic that we've enjoyed recently in our warehouses. In sum, we're continuing to expand these activities. It's evolving and improving. And then drive our business both online and in store and certainly some of the tax savings will go towards driving that as well.","Next, let me review the February results before we turn at March 4th. As reported in our release, net sales for the month came in at $10.21 billion, a 12.8% increase from the $9.05 billion last year. Lunar New Year and Chinese New Year that occurred in February this year as compared to January last year. We estimate that this positively impacted the other international February sales by about 4.5 percentage points and the total company February sales by a little more than 0.5 percentage point. For the first 26 weeks of fiscal 2018, we reported sales of -- we have now reported sales of $68.51 billion, 12% increase from $61.18 billion in the same number of weeks last year.","I won\u2019t go through all the numbers that you see in the press release, but again on a four week basis, the reported 9% U.S. ex-gas effects will be 7.5%. The 8.4% reported for Canada will be a 3.2%. The 22.2% other international would still be a very strong 14.1%, and total company 10.5% reported comp ex-gas in effects 7.7% to positive. And as I mentioned, ecommerce ex-FX 37% compared to the reported 38.1%.","In terms of regional merchandizing categories for February, general highlights from the month. U.S. regions were the strong results for the Southeast, Los Angeles and Midwest. Internationally in local currencies at Taiwan, Japan and Mexico, were the top of the list this month. Foreign currencies year-over-year relative to dollar total company benefitted by about 150 basis points, again I think for the last quarter it was 180.","Canada was helped by about 425 basis points, and while other internationals helped by about 800 basis points. The impact of cannibalization on the total company in February was about 60 basis points. And the impact on the U.S. was about 40. At Canada, where we did quite a few openings this year was about 140 basis points impact from that. Now very small impact on our international to the tune of 30 basis points.","In terms of merchandise highlights, food, sundries, comp sales for the month were positive mid-to-high single digits. Departments with the strongest results were tobacco, liquor and candy. Hardlines were up low double digits better performing departments were majors, tires and health and beauty aids, HABA. Majors were up mid to high 20s led by appliances, computers and tablets. So very strong showing there both in-store and online.","Softlines were up mid to high single digits, better performing departments included the domestics, jewelry and apparel. Fresh Foods was up in the high single digits, better performing departments were meat, bakery and deli. Within the ancillary businesses, gas also still helped by the cannibalization with gas, food court and optical had the best comp sales results in February. Gas prices were higher year-over-year and had a positive impact on our total reporting comps of about 135 basis points.","Our comp traffic or frequency for February was up 5.2% worldwide and 4.8% in the U.S. So an improvement over Q2\u2019s frequency figures as well. For February, the average transaction was up 5.1% for the month, which includes the impacts both of FX gas as well as the shift to the Lunar Chinese New Year.","I did want to make one other comment. As you know, we reported our earnings 45 minutes before the call and the first thing that comes out with some of the news releases very quickly and where we beat the number or we missed the number. When we look at first call and the 27 or so analysts that put numbers in there, it appears to us there were about 12 to 27 over the last month or so have adjusted their numbers, their estimates for some estimate of tax reform benefit. If you adjust based on what they were before that it looks like the first call number of 146 I believe comes down $0.04 or $0.05 by that. I am just mentioning that because there's -- this confusion out there and everybody as we report given this quarter of transition.","Lastly, our fiscal \u201918 third quarter scheduled earnings release dates for the 12 week third quarter ending May 30, and we'll do the same thing it'll be an after market close on Thursday May 31st with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific Time.","With that, I'll open it up for questions. Back to you, Kristie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","First question, Richard, can you discuss what's happening with spend per member trend and it\u2019s clearly increasing ex-gas. But can you talk about if members are spending in existing categories or new ones and then I have a follow up to that.","Richard Galanti","Well, it's a little of both. I think you also have to add in there that -- I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'm willing to bet that I know our average price per item has come down. I mean, we've done a lot of driving greater value just on the MVMs alone, you're seeing significant savings. In some cases a small amount from us but more from our suppliers, because it drives more sales. And we're getting with 20% to 30% fewer items, more total sales and more gross margin dollars.","So I would guess that -- now to the extent that we're doing things like, I\u2019ve given you examples overtime, like certain apparel items like women\u2019s athletic wear that's going from 0 to 100 million in the last few years. Certainly in the last year, year and a half we've seen a big improvement in white goods, with the advent of being supplied by all the majors. And I don't have exact numbers in front of me, but I'd be willing to guess while we'd had some of the prior first -- second quarter on annualized basis that\u2019s well over 250, 300 million a year and growing. So there\u2019s going to be a few of those things as well. It\u2019s mostly frequency when you look at it.","Simeon Gutman","Can you share what percentage of your members are spending online with you and is there any change in how frequently they\u2019re visiting?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t have the exact numbers, it\u2019s still -- I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still a low number. I don\u2019t know frankly if somebody had it, if it\u2019s 10 or 20 or 25. I know that when I -- from last week\u2019s budget meeting, when we look at in terms of the number of -- the open rate of emails, it has gone up substantially. Part of that is what we\u2019re sending them. We\u2019re sending them some really high items that get their attention, including while supplies last in store on some of these items. And that get their interest.","I know we\u2019re seeing a better connect rate and again I don\u2019t want to give you numbers that I don\u2019t know exactly, but all those things are going in the right direction. As they should given as I said before there is a lot of low hanging food there, because there is a lot of things we hadn\u2019t done in the past.","Simeon Gutman","And my follow-up is just on the Visa Card, you\u2019re cycling the benefit I know we\u2019re not talking about the buckets anymore. But can you just tell us how your profit pool is performing versus your own expectations?","Richard Galanti","As it relates to Citi Visa?","Simeon Gutman","Exactly, yes.","Richard Galanti","The first four quarters, because it was so sizeable we shared with you the effective basis points of improved SG&A and margin related to how -- compared to the prior deal. We\u2019re now in the first couple of quarters, three quarters after that. For the year, it will still be an improvement but relatively small improvement. And when we started -- at the beginning of the anniversary, the first anniversary, because when you started you\u2019ve got some extra money to drive things, those fall off.","We\u2019re still getting new sign-ups, we\u2019re still getting new account, we\u2019re seeing people spend more on it, we\u2019re see people spend more outside on it, which again is part of the revenue share. So I would say we\u2019re still very pleased with it. My guess is it will continue to grow this year less than our sales growth total company. And then probably consistent with that in the future from this big benefit that we started with.","Now by the way, we\u2019re using some of that as well. I mentioned the adding the executive membership. We did several things that were successful over the holidays where if on top of the fact already that if you have to Citi Visa Card, if you buy a television for example at Costco, you automatically get 90-day return policy and a two year warranty. If you purchase it with say Visa Card, not only you get another 2% off on that on top of the 2% if you\u2019re an executive member, but you get another two-year on your warranty, so you get four-year warranty.","On top of all that, we used some of the bucket if you will to drive even greater values, which drove people in. Where there were examples I don\u2019t have them in front of me, but literally on a $1,200, $1,300 retail TV where we were already at great savings on top fiscal that, if you use your Citi Visa Card, you got $150 to $300 cash card depending on what TV and when it was. So we\u2019re clearly -- I think I mentioned last time what we see with these dollars wherever they\u2019re coming from, whether it\u2019s from that bucket from the membership fee income bucket, from tax reform bucket, you name it, there is lot of buckets right now. There is -- we believe that we can use those to drive sales in lots of ways that perhaps give us a little more octane that we would have thought.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel.","John Heinbockel","So Richard, if I look at the 2019 new tax rate. Am I right that the tax benefit in aggregate is about $300 million, is that fair?","Richard Galanti","Well, take the pretax and -- well we don't know exactly. But if you look at we've been running at about 35.5 and subtract about -- and not only say 20, it's around 7 percentage points. I don't know if it's 6.5 to 7.5. You've got U.S. which is there\u2019s broad brush strokes, 70% of our earnings, so that's decide to get the benefit. You have some offsets from that, clearly some of the benefits from deferred tax foreign tax credits some things go away and things like that. So net-net, all that included we estimate that it's going to be around to 28 plus or minus.","John Heinbockel","It sounded -- you talked about the benefit to the bottom line being more indirect. So whatever that is, it sounds like the vast majority of whatever the savings is the plan is to reinvest that in some form. Is that fair? And you listed a bunch of buckets. Are they all of equal sizes? And you didn\u2019t mentioned e-commerce bucket. Is there one of those or is that blended into the other ones you talked about?","Richard Galanti","Well, when I talked about buckets, I really talked about what are additional moneys that we've got to things we've done in the last couple of years or benefitted from during the last couple of years. Notably, credit card switch, membership fee increase and of late tax legislative changes. All those things allow us to do more of what we do. And so again, I'm not being cute, but we'll suddenly fall to bottom line, yes. We also take care of our employees. We're looking a lot of different things now. Whenever we do, it's going to be something that's permanent not a onetime bonus necessarily. And we're going to take care of things.","And we're also -- what we have seen is many of the things we've done value wise have while maybe lower the gross margin or dollars per sale unit that we've seen increase gross margin dollars because we sale heck a lot more units. And some of the things we're seeing now and the benefit of doing a better job of getting unit, even open your email. Now I don't know if we\u2019ve gone from a D to C, or C to B or B to an A, but my guess is there is still some room for benefit there. And I think the big thing we want to communicate is we feel good about what we're doing and good about what's going on. But there is never a dull moment out there.","John Heinbockel","You've talked about pushing value. How does anything new with regard to KS in terms of product development or your pricing versus national brands, how does that play into this?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean the one that I read about recently in the press was our new hazelnut spread, which is basically Nutella. I mean, it is literally flying off the shelf. It's a great value and it's a great quality. There is several -- in every budgeting and every board meeting we see a whole plenty of new items that we're getting ready to try and rollout, whether it's organic, shelf stable food items or apparel KS items and others cosmetics. We've got a couple of fragrance items out there under that we've tested and we're going to continue to drive. So it's lots of little things.","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, do you guys yet know or been able to calculate the benefits you get to U.S. comp from the Sam\u2019s closings. And have you started -- I imagine you've started to see that already, right.","Richard Galanti","We started to see with after. The first week everybody rushes to get sale items on 20% or 30% off. It\u2019s small as we expected. We each have to do our own estimate, but we think we've got a little bit of sales out of it and a little bit of member signs up from it, and that\u2019s continuing. My guess is if the average Sam's Club in the U.S. as I understand is in the low 90s, people say the 63 they closed were less than that.","When I spoke to Craig immediately about it, Head of Operation, their collective view was that we'll probably get 10% or 20% of it not 50% or 70% of it. I originally thought that was low. But we do recognize not all of them are immediately closed, many of them are but some of them aren't, some of it\u2019s not the same customers and we wouldn't necessarily get it overnight and some we will. But look it\u2019s -- with all the other buckets even a small bucket this is nice thing to have here.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers.","Chris Horvers","I think a lot of investors trying to figure out the strength in e-commerce. And I know there's a lot going on in terms of what you're doing on check out and category extensions and so forth. But could you perhaps rank the benefits, whether it's -- where would you put appliances versus extending the IO versus some of the brands and versus the rollout of online grocery.","Richard Galanti","The roll out of online grocery is a very small piece of it. As that\u2019s just started -- but it is driving traffic. I think the biggest things are awareness and cross marketing, doing more activities in store to let people know about what's online and a better job of getting people to open their emails. And that's come with the headline if you will, which is something that's really hot in store and there's also a lot. Again, if you go to the site lately take a look and again I think we are starting from a low base and a low metric given on what we haven\u2019t done in the past.","And so you talk to our e-commerce people and our head of relative department heads of merchandising, or head of merchandising, they feel pretty good that this will continue. I'm not suggesting 40 on 40 on 40 every year. But even when they hit 30 for the first time, Bob Nelson and I are asking well what happens a year from now, the view is there's a lot of things they got going on that should continue to drive it but stay tuned we'll see. On top of that, we're getting off to a good start albeit with a conscious slow -- soft opening of both delivery sites.","Chris Horvers","And that's really my follow up. And so how is what uptake are you getting in the online grocery and could you compare the two day delivery option versus Instacart. And I think a lot of people ask us is this going to diminish the trip to the warehouse and thus the overall spend that I have goes down and then the margin rate of me as a customer also goes down. Any thoughts on that as well?","Richard Galanti","Well look the only data that we know that\u2019s more than three months old or six months old is going back to the original data that we have from what we're doing to Google's shopping express, the longest period of time in the Bay area, where it was strongest. What we typically saw back then and again that did not include fresh though. And then we saw an existing member who is making these numbers up, they were growing their total purchase with us by 3% a year. They do it by more than 3% but they came in a couple of two to four less times and shopped online more times, several more times on that because when they shopped online, it was a lower average ticket that when they came in store. Mind you, it\u2019s a little different we\u2019re seeing a bigger average spend from on the Instacart side.","And some of this at the two-day and we\u2019re actually adding some items, I think last time I mentioned we started through our business of about 10 business centers, which covers essentially the entire Continental United States, virtually the entire Continental United States. We started with our 470 or 480 SKUs out of the regular warehouse being serviced out of business centers. We\u2019ve actually added some items to that. And I think the goal was to add a couple of hundred over the next six months. And it\u2019s working so far but it\u2019s new.","And so we can\u2019t promise anything. We recognize with fresh how much of it is going to be fill in versus I\u2019ll go few times less to Costco. What gives us a little comfort at this point, but that\u2019s all it is, is the results that we\u2019ve seen from the ways we communicate with our member online. But if you go on right now you\u2019ll see there are several very exciting items that are just in store and while supplies last, that drives traffic and that gets you in the store.","So as much as -- everybody is going to know somebody that\u2019s going to shop a lot less in store, because they\u2019re getting all their groceries at Costco or more stuff fresh delivered. At a better price than the day before on Instacart because the prices are better today and even the better price to costco.com, Costco, and even better of course as you come in. And we\u2019ll keep sending that message as well. But I think we\u2019re honestly at two plus years before we really know something on that. Certainly, nine to 12 months before we have any inkling of what it means.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly.","Edward Kelly","So I just wanted to ask about price investment. And not so much about the quantity, but I was hoping that you could just maybe talk about the elasticity on price investment in your business and how maybe it defers from some of your traditional competitors. Whether having less SKUs less that you need to focus on less SKU overlap. How that actually impacts what you\u2019re seeing from an elasticity standpoint when you actually do make those investments?","Richard Galanti","Well, it was just a year ago when we had slightly disappointing second quarter result, partly because of the change in the number of days the MVMs were out there. And in the explaining why we did it to start with, why is this because overtime whenever you do, it gets a little stale or not in every instance but in some instances. So you try two things. Over those few months and continuing to today, we\u2019re continue to try new things with our vendors as well.","And I used water as an example. We were a great value on 40.5 liters of Kirkland Signature and the price maybe different in a given state or something based on transportation. But I think we were at 349, which is the best price out there doing heck of a lot of volume. And now we\u2019re I believe 299 every day. Well, you can imagine our various suppliers said, well how can we do this? Well, you have huge increases in unit volumes. And guess what happened on the way to the forum.","The brand just needs to come down in price too, because they're losing market share. I think that's something that's unique about us that limited selection we could take, I get back to that word I used about more octane in the dollar that we use. You take something like that TV example, we did $30 million $40 million on one SKU in fixed rate days. And how do you do that? You do that because one, it's limited two, it's already great price and three, it's even a greater value because of what we can do with partnering with our suppliers on it. And then on top of that, there is these other buckets I gave the example of if you use your Citi Visa card. While we got some signups out of that some applications on that.","So I think that tends to be a little different. I gave the example last quarter at the end of that 10 days leading up and through Labor Day weekend when traditional retailers out there selling USDA Choice strip steaks at -- I'm making the number of 849 or 899 and we\u2019re 799 we were at 699. And we locked up lots of newer strip steaks in the weeks preceding that. And we saw a noticeable drive into the warehouse. So I think that having -- it's a lot easier to do where you've got 3,800 items out there versus 50,000 in a supermarket or 100,000 plus in multi-general stores.","Edward Kelly","And then I just wanted to ask you about labor generally and tax reinvestment. There has been a lot of talk in the marketplace about investing in labor. I mean, we heard from Target earlier this week about moving the $12 an hour. I mean you were at the upper end of the pay scale for in terms of what you're paying your employees. But there is rising tide just lift all boats here. How are you thinking about this philosophically? Are you looking to maintain historical wage gaps that you've had. How should we be thinking about this for you?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think we always want to maintain a significant preview overall. We have to look at all the pieces of it. It's not just the headline starting range. It's not just a one-time bonus, it's also healthcare. If you look at the average used U.S. because every country is different, but relative to what's in that country it\u2019s the same types of premiums. The average U.S. wage of our 90% of our employees were hourly, when they start yesterday or 20 years ago is the 22.25 to 22.5 I believe. On top of that, whether you're part-time or fulltime, you've got a great medical dental admission plan that on average costs the company over $10,000, little over $10,000 where we pay 90% of it roughly.","So we have a great -- now by the way that covers -- and independence as well. But on average it's little over two people per covered employee. But at the end of the day, even if the bottom is scaled gets a little closer, the delta between the entire compensation is significantly greater. Notwithstanding that, we do what we're going to do even before tax law changes. We're going to do a little more because we can.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder.","Dan Binder","I saw you had a program out there on the auto renewals. We get $20 gift card if you signup. I was just curious how effective that program has been. And then also on membership, you've mentioned that there was a slow start to executive conversions in the quarter. I was just curious what you think that was related to and then how are you able to shift the pace on that?","Richard Galanti","Well, actually latter question our membership marketing the people are looking at it, I don't know exactly. My guess it has -- we had a strong first quarter where it averaged over 21,000 a week of new. Our sign ups during the quarter were fine. But my guess is it has to do with what did we do a year earlier or how were they collecting certain data. I am just relieved that the second half of the quarter it improved greatly. And my guess is it\u2019s not a big issue. Now the first question?","Dan Binder","I just saw through a personal experience you have a $20 gift card offer for signing up on auto renewal for members who haven't done it yet related to the new card. I was just curious how effective that program has been?","Richard Galanti","I don't know specifically of that program. I know we do a lot of things as relates to that. We did some -- it sounds silly but we did some programs to sign up get member\u2019s email addresses, which we do a better job when they sign up now as a new member. But we were below 50% with valid email addresses and in two instances in the last few months and about a week or 10 day period we got over a million numbers to get their email addresses by giving them something like $2 off on muffins or something.","Dan Binder","So with the improvement in the renewal rates this quarter, trends obviously reversed. Do you anticipate small improvements over the next several quarters based on that experience that you talked about on prior calls with what you saw in Canada?","Richard Galanti","I would hope so. I mean, I think just copy what happened over the several quarters after Canada. Canada is now above where it was before the conversion started 2.5 years ago. And Canada went down over six quarters for the conversion quarter six quarters and five quarters out by I believe 100 basis points the renewal rate, and now it\u2019s two or three, tenths of a percent higher than it was before that. U.S. only went down around six tenths of a percent so now it's back up a tenth from that minus six. History should show that that will happen, but we\u2019ll have to wait and see.","Dan Binder","And then just last item on freight. Just curious there has been a number of retailers talking about that pressure. And in some cases, it's been material impact to the earnings outlook. I didn\u2019t really hear much on that today. I was curious if you have any thoughts and how it may impact you?","Richard Galanti","Well, the higher freight costs and availability of containers impacts all of us. It's interesting, it's not talked a lot about where I think what it\u2019s made us do is we're doing a better job on back hauling, a more conscious effort. Historically, we always back hauled extra pallets and recycle like cardboard, corrugated and you can basically can make more dollars doing that. But we really had done a lot on back hauling supplies merchandise from vendors.","And so I think that's mitigated a little bit of late but I think it's still a net number. My guess would be it's not as impactful to us as it is to traditional retailer based on what I just said. 90% of our goods go through our cross dock people operations. You've got literally thousands put into low single digit thousands -- and several thousand trucks that are going out, trailers that are now not every one of them, but picking up things whether it's produce from Central Washington or Central California or working with suppliers, because we don\u2019t do long haul. But we\u2019re able -- it\u2019s a lot easier to do these kinds of things when you got limited items.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Karen Short.","Karen Short","So I just wanted to clarify in terms of tax reform benefits. In terms of the puts and takes we think to the rest of the year and into the fiscal \u201919. Obviously, you commented on investing in employees, investing in price. Is that something that we should expect fairly quickly or is that something both of those that would have a little bit of lead time and you\u2019re still to be determined? Just to clarify.","Richard Galanti","I\u2019ll give you a better clarity on that in the next call. We\u2019ve continued to invest in price over the last year and we\u2019re going to continue to that. I think we\u2019ve already started a little of that on the employee side. Something that will be forthcoming, my guess is in the next two months. So it will impact Q3 less than a full Q3 whatever it is.","Karen Short","On both wage and price, and then on\u2026","Richard Galanti","On employees. On price, where I starting to do a little that but we\u2019ve also had the benefit of various buckets, it\u2019s not -- all these buckets are fungible.","Karen Short","And then I don\u2019t think you gave inflation in the quarter. Wondering if you could give that both at cost and at retail?","Richard Galanti","On inflation, I think it\u2019s -- ever so slightly up on a cost basis, which would lead me to believe that flat or slightly down on an retail sales basis given what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019ll go next question and then I\u2019ll get it for you.","Karen Short","And just on Instacart, I know you did say that ticket was larger on Instacart. So I guess two questions on Instacart. One is can you maybe give a little more color on how much larger the average spend is or average ticket is on Instacart. And then obviously Sam\u2019s announced the rollout of Instacart as well. Is there anything change with your pricing strategy on your Instacart offering as a function of that announcement?","Richard Galanti","Well, to the latter no. I mean our strategy has always to be very competitive. And if we have to be more competitive, we will. And we feel we\u2019re very competitive on the things that we\u2019re doing. What was the first part of your question?","Karen Short","Just some quantification on how much bigger the average ticket is?","Richard Galanti","Well, when I say it\u2019s a little high average ticket, it\u2019s a little higher average ticket than what we experienced with like Google Shopping Express, which didn\u2019t include fresh. I believe it\u2019s a double-digit number but in the higher double-digits rather than the middle double-digits.","As it relates to inflation, when I look at our LIFO in this index that we don\u2019t use for anymore, I am not asking out or accounting people, but at some point we will. If I look at our composite year-to-date fiscal \u201918 among the various categories, it\u2019s deflationary by 14 basis points that\u2019s from our fiscal year-end September 3rd or 4th last year. And I would say overall it\u2019s slightly inflationary, because that is -- and looking at the turnover in the different category. So my guess is it\u2019s -- and in the last four weeks, it was exactly zero. So I would say, this is cost which would tend -- led me to believe that we're slightly -- or definitely deflationary compared to that because we're lowering prices.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom.","Chuck Grom","Just trying to understand something here, so no inflation, you're investing more in price. Yet your core on core margins as a percentage of sales were up, I think you said 14 basis points, which was the best performance with the third quarter with three of the four large categories up. So can you just help us understand the improvement in the margins this quarter and looking ahead, any sustainability of that trend?","Richard Galanti","Recognizing it's not just the full core-on-core there's so many other little things. An improvement in our Travel business, which is a very high gross margin business, we don't -- the value of that plane ticket and hotel. It's the broker commission with very little SG&A associated with it. So very little cost to sales. All those things help a little bit. I think within the 80% of our business, which is core-on-core, fresh foods, hardlines, softlines and food sundries and talking to our head of merchandising two days ago, probably the two biggest rigs are what we call internally improved D&D.","It's where damage and destroy when we're having to mark things down less whatever we get from our vendors. There might be spoilage allowance or returns allowance within something. But generally speaking, we showed an improvement there. And we've also shown a little bit of an improvement with -- now I can't quantify whether that's a basis point or a few, but it's an example.","Another one is you take the example of $1000 item that we sell for $1,100 just to make the numbers up. So $100 gross margin on $1,100, it's whatever 9% or whatever it is. If we get an extra 150 off through an MVM, we're now selling it for $950 still making $100 gross margin. So we just improved our gross margin percent. You're talking about billions of dollars a year in the aggregate, low double-digits but still real money. Fresh foods penetration increases generally speaking even though fresh foods, I believe it was slightly up, but fresh foods has a higher margin department. Apparel is a higher margin department. We've had good growth.","I think in the three or four years we've seen what we call apparel and to couple of different departments, men's, women's and kids, up 9%-ish compounded for three or four years on $7 billion or so business worldwide. So that tends to be a higher margin. So my guess is it's a little things and part of it is getting our vendors, our suppliers working with them, we don't want just more money from them if we can't drive more sales to make up for it and get more dollars. So all those things help.","Chuck Grom","And then just quickly on February. I think you said that hardlines were up low doubles and majors were the highest tracking, I think mid-to-high 20s. Can you just touch that for us what let to the premier? And I presume maybe appliances where we're very strong around February, does that help that?","Richard Galanti","Computer is -- not only desktops but importantly laptops and tablets as well and appliances. Those are all very strong, and online has helped us as well in those categories in the aggregate. So some of it has to do with -- I get back to the $150 to $300 off on a TV that's already at incredibly low price if you use your Costco Visa card, all of those things help drive the business.","I want to get back to the previous question also on what I could tell you about gross margin. Years ago we started highlighting that because that\u2019s the core business and there's lots of other things like traffic, like gasoline that\u2019s go up or down 300 basis points in gross margin within that department and is 10% of your total Company. Whatever it is, it'll be a little better or a little worse each quarter. I think it\u2019s more important to understand where -- I'm not suggesting I don't know what the next quarter is going to be. But Murphy's Law always tells you, we continue to feel good about what we're doing and there's lots of little pieces that affect that gross margin.","Chuck Grom","And then just one housekeeping. You guys said that there\u2019s obviously a sales impact on the quarterly results. I think you said 140 basis points. Just wondering if there was any bottom line impact in 2Q?","Richard Galanti","Well, the bottom line impact other than the sales themselves, I mean hopefully we're doing a pretty good job of scheduling hourly employees in the warehouse. When you do a little better than your planned, you beat the heck out of the numbers because you have fewer employees doing the same work and when you miss your number a little bit, sales is richer on the SG&A line. I don't think that's that big of an issue. And probably a bigger issue which I can\u2019t tell you the answer is, I can just tell you what the issue is, would be holidays, paid holidays.","When one of those falls in a -- that's more in our monthly budget meetings, our every four week budget meetings when the operators will have to explain some tonights. Payroll percent was up 10 or more basis points, but there was an extra -- particularly around Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Year's, or Easter event, sometimes these things will fall in a different month, different four week period that we have. So that impacts it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Olive Chen.","Oliver Chen","Regarding the e-commerce details, what's ahead with fulfillment in terms of how you're thinking about fulfillment speed and inventory management, and how that may flow through on a longer term basis in terms of CapEx needs and as you think about certain fixed costs associated with the march towards different fulfillment options for the consumer. And the second e-com question is just about engagement. It really sounds like awareness and marketing is a factor in driving traffic to e-com at large. What do you think are the next steps just to improve that engagement over time? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well, as it relates to fulfillment and the costs, we are spending more money. We're building some actual e-commerce fulfillment centers, in part because we're running out of room in some of the depots where we did it that. I think we're doing one in Tracy California, or Mira Loma, and Annex but it's a major multi double digit millions of dollars. We have a little more inventory in the system in e-commerce because we're fulfilling from closer places as we do more business.","We have a greater commitment with this delivery whereas two days us through our business -- through roughly 10 of our business delivery centers with these 500 or so items, that's more inventory in the system right while we do that, so all those things are costing us a little more in that regard that's in the numbers as well and it will continue to be. In terms of -- if you look at a CapEx Company that's a $2.5 billion range, there's always -- just when you think you're done with cross dock operations, we\u2019re adding, expanding some, adding a second one in Japan even though we only have 27 rate units right now, but geographically, it makes sense now. I\u2019m putting one into, I believe, Australia soon. Building a bakery commissary in Canada and a chicken plant in Nebraska and a second meat plant for us in the Midwest, so all those things are a bit additive to us.","So I think as it relates to fulfillment, you\u2019ll still see some more, but it\u2019s in the 0 to 200 million a year not -- we\u2019re going to go and have to spend an extra $500 million or itself. And as we go from 0 to 200 million even, what dropped out of the another bucket there but do the same, we have cash flow to do it. We never sat down and said which can we do first because we have to limit what we do based on that ex-amount of dollars.","As it relates to awareness and engagement, short-term there is some of the blocking and tackling. I know ecommerce operations, they\u2019ve engaged some outside parties to help with some of the -- what I\u2019ll call targeted marketing engagement 101 and to see what more we can do. But right now, there is still a lot to be done, we\u2019re just getting more email address, getting that over rate to continue to go up in right direction, which it is.","Oliver Chen","And you made a lot of progress with buy online pickup in-store. What are you thinking about or what you\u2019re monitoring about what made sense there, and what you think about refrigeration. Will that be an option and a good option or what items are best suited for that program? Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler.","Matt Fassler","Richard, my first question relates to the ancillary business. You had a fairly subdued comparison a year ago on gas profitability presumably and obviously this year ancillary was a big contributor. And you indicated that gas was a piece of that and also some of the other businesses that you\u2019ve discussed in Q&A as well. What\u2019s your thought process on gas and its contribution to margin both on the -- based on the current gas price environment, which is relatively stable and also on the comparisons they evolved through last year? Hello?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t what happened there guys.","Matt Fassler","I think Oliver might have been in the midst of asking a question when I was called on onto the lot. So you can do that or go to my question first.","Richard Galanti","Well, I\u2019m not sure did you hear the answer. I answered the question related to CapEx and expansion of fiscal activates or inventory needs related to driving fulfillment. And then I answered the question he had about awareness. Did you hear that?","Matt Fassler","Some of that, so it\u2019s really\u2026","Richard Galanti ","Why don\u2019t we go on with your question and [indiscernible] get back on the line.","Matt Fassler","Did you hear my question on ancillary, Richard?","Richard Galanti ","No, I did not.","Matt Fassler","The question related to the benefit that you received from ancillary this quarter, which was substantial. And some of it related to gases as you discussed and some to non-cash businesses. And taking a look back at the year ago, your ancillary margins were down sharply, gas I think has something to do with it. So what's your thought process on gas margins intrinsically relative to trend I guess on a dollar basis or penny per gallon basis in the current environment with relatively stable gas prices, particularly as you come up against I guess some more normalized comparisons in the second half of the year?","Richard Galanti","Well, a lot of the gas -- the price per gallon is up, profitability has been okay and have been pretty good. And a lot of has to gallons, I think our gallons were up 9%, 9%-10% almost 10% compared to a U.S. industry that's up in the low like 2%. On the ancillaries, I think two things. One, if I look back at last year, there was Bob what's the last year that hit us there was a catch up or something in ancillary? I think that my guess I don't have the exact number in front of me. My guess is that I know we've had strong ancillary performance. My guess is as nothing was called out last year or if it was a little disappointing, it was and so there is probably a little offset there as well. I know that many of the ancillaries are growing nicely and improving margins, bottom line margin.","Matt Fassler","And if I can just ask a second question, you're asked about Instacart already. If you think about the customer who is turning to Instacart as the program grows with you. Do you have a sense as to what the impact is or what the contribution is of legacy Costco customers who are now moving to Instacart? And how their behavior changes if at all as they shop Instacart in the store?","Richard Galanti","We don't know yet. It's just want to know yet and to do. When we look back at -- again the early days of the in the Bay area with the Google's Shopping Express, we saw it was a net increase in total spender a year with a few ship reduction in store and several deliveries more than offset it. My guess is with fresh being more dominant of course with Instacart, you might have a little bit. And what we're finding is this is more anecdotal, there are plenty of people that are using it simply fulfillment and still coming just as long, but we don't know yet.","We're also by the way finding -- signing up members that we didn't have before. And both with the Instacart White Label as well as Costco's two-day grocery where we can deliver to places that are 150 miles from a Costco, and we haven't tried to market to those people yet.","Matt Fassler","And based on your comment on size, it sounds like even though you're not for 400 clubs, it sounds like it's not material to the traffic acceleration?","Operator","We have our next question comes from Peter Benedict.","Peter Benedict","Hey Richard\u2026","Richard Galanti","By the way, I've taken my arms off the table so I don't touch the cord and disconnect.","Peter Benedict","Matt\u2019s had a heck of a time with Q&A the last couple of days. But anyway, we\u2019ll move on. Can you give us a sense maybe what percentage of the business today is vertical with you guys owning product from production all the way to sale. And if you're not going to speak any numbers, maybe just which categories is that most present in and where can you where can you take that over the next few years?","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t have a percentage calculated. But where it is, we have a hotdog plant that makes all of the Christmas season hotdogs for United States, almost all of them were at capacity. We have a meat plant in California that is over 4 million pounds a week four or five SKUs just for us. It's our meat plant. We have two optical grinding labs that grind 5.5 million to 6 million pair of prescription glasses that we sell every year. I guess you could say we have two central fill facilities both for filling prescriptions for our own pharmacies as well as mail order for ours and a few others of third parties.","We're building a major chicken plant in Nebraska that will allow us to source ourselves about 100 million chickens a year, which is less than a quarter of our needs. Although, another 30% to 40% our needs are sourced in business what\u2019s referred to as dedicated plants. We're not the only one that does it using one of the three or four large providers that we shared all the profitability and costs related to that plant. But to say we think we can do that better than others, because we have them do many fewer SKUs than traditional retailers in that area.","We do some package of candies and nuts so that\u2019s semi-vertical. We have a bakery commissary that we've just started production in Canada, that was done out of necessity in the two largest commissaries that they serve some of our bakery needs were acquired by the two largest grocery retailers over the last few years. But in hindsight, it seems to be working and trying to think what else. We do lots the packaging of gift baskets and clamshell type stuff that we do ourselves and that's somewhat vertical not completely.","So I don't know what all that adds up to. My guess it\u2019s 10% or less in total maybe 5%. But at the end of the day where is it going to go in the future, I think you'll see more fees related to sourcing of foods and commodities and proteins whether it's high house produce or doing things with chickens and cows, I don't know.","Peter Benedict","On ecommerce, any plans to roll out the signage and the tablets beyond those. I think you said 195 clubs that are in today. And just how is the labor in the club you used to facilitate the buy online pick up stores. Is that a new role or are you just taking existing folks and then repurposing them?","Richard Galanti","No, we aren\u2019t rolling it out. First of all, we have employees that actually have tablet with them and particularly in areas like electronics and perhaps home furnishings seasonal items, big ticket items that in likelihood they are there and looking at it, but they still choose to buy it online. In some cases like white goods, you can only -- you can look at it there but you can only have it received and ordered online. So we\u2019re doing it but it\u2019s working so far and we expect to see in more locations.","Peter Benedict","And then just with the bulk of buy online pickup in-store. How are you staffing that from a labor perspective?","Richard Galanti","Just staff, I mean, they\u2019re going through training. They are going through third-party training in some cases we\u2019re working with our vendors in some cases.","Peter Benedict","And then last just housekeeping. The D&A number, I don\u2019t know if you gave that for the second quarter. Do you guys have that?","Richard Galanti","Which one?","Peter Benedict","Depreciation?","Richard Galanti","It will be in the queue, my apologies, we don\u2019t.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin.","Scott Mushkin","So I want to give another shot at the ecommerce question on margin. Richard, we\u2019ve talked about over the last couple of years and the challenges of bringing omni-channel to retailer. I was just wondering if you could talk about how you\u2019re thinking about as you slowly go down that omni-channel road and what we should think about as margin? It seems like you\u2019re almost pricing differently in the different channels. But I was wondering if you could frame it for us as that grows as a part of your business? Clearly, not hurting yet.","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all with delivery, you\u2019ve got -- somebody has got to pay for it. In some cases, we\u2019re testing to see how to include it in the price and do we charge for it, do we subsidize it, whatever. We\u2019re trying lots of different things. When you say going slowly, arguably we do a lot of things slowly. We started with ecommerce slowly 15 to 20 years ago. I look at it as, if there is some out there and that says, here in the 50 things we should be doing, let us with the menu of 50 things and we\u2019re going to choose the 10 or 50 or how that we see works for us in our environment.","And every time we -- so far when do these things it works and it works our way. And it\u2019s not unlike when we first started to business that you can\u2019t sell only 3,800 items or whatever it is and have limited categories, we recognize that value is more than just great -- the lowest price on the relative quality and quantity of something where we are second to none. But on top of that, convenience and delivery from some is as well but we can\u2019t be everything to everybody. So far that\u2019s working very well for us even as we move in some cases slowly in some of these new areas.","I think we\u2019re fortunate that we\u2019re able to find those niches. And these are item business, the same concerns the people have about are we getting our share of millennials, we are. Are they buying as much? Well, they\u2019re buying as much as the old gen whatever is did, when they were that age. But what we\u2019re finding is items that pertain well for that and we\u2019ll see. And which of these are complementary? Again, I don\u2019t know where we are five years from now. I know we have some things that we\u2019ve done on the table, we all do now. I know there\u2019s some things that we\u2019re going to be doing over the next year or so to continue to grow it, and we\u2019ll see where we go.","Scott Mushkin","So my second question is with the tax and the reinvestment. Any thoughts like, our survey to consumers are they just ask is that the two stress point for consumers and going to the store at this point, parking lots and check out. Any thought on trying to ease, I mean it's a good problem to have. But mean the checkout process at Costco can back way up and of course the parking lots can. Any thoughts of using some of the money to try to ease those two friction points for consumers?","Richard Galanti","Well, what\u2019s interesting is we've got 4% traffic growth year-on-year-on-year and we put a lot of time and effort in front end to speed you out. One of the things we're concerned about with order online and pick up in store is we don't want you there if you're not going to come through. People talk about having urgent care or doc-in-the box things. We don't want you to sit for an hour waiting for a shot, and not shopping. But as it relates specifically to front end, we continue to expand, in the last probably eight years, nine years, we have reduced -- we have spent in terms of the average number of customers through an open register, an open staffed register, has gone from the low-40s to the low-50s per hour.","Now it may not seem like that but it's like being in the red light. It seems like longer than it is. That being said, I just had an offside meeting last week for a day and half. And one of the things we'll be rolling out do things at the front end, testing in about 50 locations that should continue to work on that. In terms of the parking lots, where we can and we expand the parking lots beyond that, I can't tell you a whole lot.","By the way the other thing is we\u2019ll continue to open an infield and cannibalize units. As one of the examples I\u2019ve given in the last few calls for another question was last year we opened effectively our fourth unit on the east side of Seattle and the Woodville, Kirkland, Issaquah area and a fourth one in San Jose and California. In both instances, we went from roughly, I'll call it, 60,000 members per location in the three, or 65,000, 180,000 to 195,000 members among free warehouses to maybe another 5,000 members in the market. But we added that of cannibalization $110 million to $125 million of annual sales, which is great. And so that certainly is a relief point also.","Now, I can't speak specifically one of our highest volume units in the Continental United States is in Westbury. Notwithstanding the fact that we have bought it was a retail big retail store next store at the supermarket maybe or a Kmart. But adding lots of things to it and it's hard to get another location and you're buying. So we always have items like that but we'll keep working on it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky.","Chuck Cerankosky","I just want to explore a little bit the 15 stores, well actually 18. Flat of course in the current fiscal year, which we think about in terms of preopening expense in that period and any SG&A burden. And then how having those clubs open sets you up for the new year for fiscal '19, especially going into the holiday season.","Richard Galanti","Well some of the preopening will start before, because as you open, let\u2019s say the first several that opened in the first several weeks of Q4 much of the preopening is incurred in the monthly up to it but in Q4 is also for 16 weeks versus 12. So my guess it'll be -- clearly be higher in Q4. And I don't know necessarily how it sets us up. There may have been a few week trends we pushed to get into this year just to try to get them open. So that saves you a little bit but we do that every year.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right, thank you.","Richard Galanti","Thank you everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Brandy. Good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s release we\u2019ll review our second quarter and first half fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12 and 24 week periods ended February 15th and our monthly four week sales results for the four week period ending this past Sunday, March 1st.","The discussions we well be having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","To begin with, our 12 week second quarter fiscal \u201915 operating results, as you saw this morning for the quarter reported earnings per share came in at a $1.35, up 29% from last year\u2019s $1.05. As noted in this morning\u2019s release this year\u2019s net income was positively impacted by a $57 million or $0.13 a share income tax benefit. This was in connection with a portion of the $5 per share special cash dividend paid by the Company last month to Company\u2019s 401(k) plan participants. Partially offsetting this reduction to the income tax line was a $14 million or $0.03 a share income tax charge related to an ongoing overseas income tax letter. And the net impact of these two discrete tax items to our reported second quarter earnings $1.35 earnings per share was $43 million or $0.10 a share to the positive. So excluding these two items EPS for the second quarter would have been a $1.25 or up 19%.","Other factors that have impacted our second quarter when you're comparing year-over-year results, gasoline operations as results of the case in Q1 \u201915, we benefitted from strong margins and profits in our gas business, I\u2019ll speak to this a little bit more, when I discuss our gross margin. FX as compared to year ago, in Q2 this year, the foreign currencies where we operate weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Japan, this resulted in our foreign earnings in Q2 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about 32 million pre-tax or $0.05 a share and those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year, so again another -- a relative weakening of these foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.","Third, IT modernization cost, as discussed in each of the past eight or 10 or so fiscal quarters, our major IT modernization efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expenses through this year and into next year and possibly well beyond especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In Q2 on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million or about $0.03 a share. Fourth, stock compensation expense, this was higher year-over-year in the quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share, while this charge was about a 4 basis point hit to SG&A it was much smaller year-over-year impact to SG&A this quarter than it was in Q1 when the year-over-year delta was $38 million or $0.06 a share to the negative.","Lastly interest income and other, this number was lower year-over-year in Q2 by 10 million in pre-tax or $0.02 a share. The decrease primarily related to the revaluation and settlement of U.S. dollar payables, primarily in our Mexico operations. As you know this line item if you will it goes back and forth sometimes it helps us a little sometimes it hurts us a little. Under GAAP these adjustments are recording to the interest income and other line.","Now in terms of sales for the quarter reported sales were up 4.3% and our 12 week reported comp sales for the year was up 2%. For the quarter sales were negatively impacted by significant year-over-year gas price deflation and this had about a 323 basis point impact to the number to the negative and by weakening FX foreign currencies relative to U.S. dollar. This was just under 250 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas our reported 4% U.S. comp sales increase in Q2 would have been plus 8, our reported minus 2 international comp assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been plus 8% as well. As for the total comps again reported 2% for the quarter plus 2% excluding gas and FX was plus 8% for the quarter on a more normalized basis. For our four week month of February which includes the last two weeks of the fiscal second quarter reported comps came in at plus one consisting of a plus two comp in the U.S., flat international. Sales again were negatively impacted by gas price deflation almost 400 basis points for the month to the negative and weakening FX just under 300 basis points to the negative. So excluding gas the plus 2% reported comp for February would have been a plus 7 the reported flat international comp would have been actually been a plus 12. And there is a little benefit in there from the switch in the Lunar New Year I believe that impacted a couple of the Asian countries for us and so as to the total comps the reported plus one for the month would have been a plus 8 excluding gas inflation and FX.","In terms of new openings after will be 9 new locations in Q1 including one reload we opened no new locations in Q2 all-to-all that puts our fiscal 2015 openings to the same quarter store as eight net new locations and we now operate 671 locations around the world. Which we now and the end of fiscal 2015 we expect to open an additional 20 new locations. And just a couple in Q3 which will end in early to mid May and then 18 planned for Q4 of these 20 additional openings before our August 30th fiscal year-end 10 are in the U.S. and 10 will be international. So it should most likely end the fiscal year with 691 total locations. Now a few of those near the very end of the fiscal year could slip into Q1 of \u201916. So my guess is that that additional 20 may be \u201917, \u201918 to those.","Also this morning I'll review to you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends and renewal rates a little more discussion on margins and SG&A in the quarter. Our recent $5 a share special cash dividend in the related billion dollar debt offering and our recent announcement related to the planned changes for our U.S. co-branded credit card offering. For our second quarter results, sales for the quarter for the 12 weeks ended February 15th were 26.87 billion up 4% from last year's 25.76 billion. On a reported comp basis as I mentioned Q2 comps were up 2 but up 8 excluding gas and FX.","Now for the quarter that reported plus two was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little over minus 3%. But again taking gas out of that number the average transaction increase would have been plus taking gas and FX out of that number the average normalized transaction increase would have been a little over 2% to the positive. And average frequency increased a little over five and a half. So year-to-date shopping frequency is up a little over 5%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region for the quarter in terms of geography Midwest, Southeast and Northeast regions were the strongest. Internationally local currencies Japan was the weakest still impacted by cannibalization of two units we opened in the last 12 months on a total base of only 20 over there. And with Taiwan, Korea and Mexico being strongest in local currency comps. In terms of merchandize categories for the quarter for the second quarter within Food and Sundries overall in the mid single-digits Candy, meat, daily, beer and wine were the relative standouts. Within hardlines overall in the low single-digits, departments were the strongest retires in electronics and consumer electronics was up in the mid single-digits.","Within mid single-digit softlines comps domestics and apparel were standouts and in fresh foods where comps were in the high singles meat showed the best results although impacted by inflation there. For February traffic was up again 5% well average transaction on a reported basis was down 3.5% but again getting really impacted by FX and even weaker gas year-over-year. Gas prices during the month before we left the February year-over-year the average pricing of gas was almost down to 31.5%.","In terms of geography Midwest, Southeast and Bay Area regions were the strongest during February and internationally in local currencies Taiwan and Korea were the strongest as I mentioned previously the shift in the New Year holiday from January to February negatively impact January comps and positively impact February comps for the company probably about 50 basis points each way. From a merchandize category standpoint ex-FX food and sundries overall for the month was in the mid single-digit range hardlines overall came in to the mid single-digits which was consist with what electronics did, during February softlines was up in the mid single-digit range and finally fresh foods up nicely in the low-teens overall with meat being the strongest and again as I mentioned this thing was quite a bit of replenishment in that area.","Moving on the line items down the income statement, membership fees we\u2019re up 4 basis points and up 6% from $550 million a year ago in the quarter to 582 or up $32 million, take out FX up 6% in dollars would have been up 9%. In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada renewal rates still is at 91, I think just a shade under that but averaging up to 91 and for the first time our fully captured worldwide rate is rounding up to 88 and sets us down to 87. Continue to increasing penetration of as you would actually remember of course helps us as well as those members tend to be the most loyal.","New membership signups in Q2 companywide were up 9%. In terms of members in Q2 end, in terms of Gold Star, we ended Q2 with 32.7 million members, up from 32.0 million up about a little under 700,000 from the end of the first quarter 12 weeks earlier. Primary business it\u2019s jumped from 6.9 million to 7.0 million add-on remained at 3.5 million, so the total numbered households 42.5 million at the end of Q1 at 43.2 million at the end of Q2 and representing total card holders going from 77.5 to 78.7 over the 12 weeks fiscal quarter at Q2 end on February 15th, paid executive memberships were a shade over 15.4 million, which is an increase of 188,000 during the quarter of about 15,000 a week and that\u2019s both new member signups as well as conversions.","Executive members as I mentioned before a little over two-thirds of our -- about two-thirds of our membership base a little over two-thirds of our membership base and just about two-thirds of our sales -- I am sorry about one-third of our membership base and about two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong again from business member renewal rates and Q1 end was 94.5, it tweaked up to 94.6 at the end of Q2, Gold Star was 89.8 that pinched up to 89.9 and total was -- remained at a 90.7 and worldwide the 87.3 went to an 87.9. You\u2019ll see a little bit bigger increase there because when you start at a lower base that tends to improve a little bit faster in those first few years.","Now I\u2019ll comment on this past Monday\u2019s press release regarding Costco entering into long-term co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and our acceptance and co-brand agreement with Visa. Yes, the press release stated we\u2019ve entered into a new co-branded credit card agreement with Citi and an acceptance and co-branded incentive agreement with Visa these agreements are subject to purchase from American Express of the existing co-branded credit card portfolio by Citi and would be implemented until next April 1, 2016 at the end of our current co-brand arrangement. While there is not a lot of specifics I can give you at this point, but I can tell you the following, once issued the new co-brand cost of Visa credit card will be accepted throughout United States and Puerto Rico, the new rewards based card will be fee free. The new card will needless to say provide generous rewards to Costco members utilizing the new card and again I can\u2019t tell you a lot of specifics about that, but we certainly look forward to telling you and our members more about it, but it probably is not going to be until several months down the road this calendar year. The new card of course will also service the members Costco membership card, again there is not a lot detail we can give you at this point needless to say what we do is ultimately for the long-term benefit for our Company and our members in this case the co-branded credit card holders as well.","Pulling down the gross margin line, gross margins were up 54 basis points on a reported basis from 10.53 to 11.07. As I always ask you to do I will ask you to notch out four columns and six line items the columns of course will be Q1 \u201915 both reported or without gas deflation and then the columns three and four would be Q2 \u201915 reported and without gas deflation. And going across those lone items, the first one is co-merchandize and reported in Q1 was minus 6 basis points year-over-year without gas deflation was minus 13. In Q2 reported was plus 10, without gas deflation was minus 20, ancillary plus 22 and plus 20 in Q1 and plus 46 and plus 49 in Q2, 2% reward minus 1 and minus 1 and then minus 5 and minus 2, LIFO plus one and plus one, and then in Q2 plus three and plus three, and then other plus six and plus seven in Q1 and zero and zero in Q2 all totaled in Q1 \u201915 year-over-year to Q1 \u201914 we had a reported gross margin improvement of 22, which is the sum of those line items from column one on a gas neutral basis it was plus 14.","Again reported for this quarter it was plus 54 and on a gas neutral basis excluding gas deflation was a plus 20. And now as you can see again our overall gross margin was outside plus 54 and even at plus 20 without gas deflation. Again a lot of this has to do with gas sales penetration, which were up as well even though at the lower price per gallon. Our core merchandise drove margin was up 10 basis points year-over-year, but again excluding as you can see in this chart it was down 20, again this is a function of both increased sales penetration and strong gross margins with our gas business. If you look at the core gross margins as a percent of the various departments of their own sales and then when I talk about core, I am talking about food and sundries, hardlines, and softlines and fresh foods which account for about 80 plus percent of our total sales. On their own sales they were down year-over-year by 3 basis points in the second quarter with food and sundries and hardlines being up year-over-year a little and softlines and fresh foods being down a little frankly margins are fine we're driving sales and certainly gas prices give us probably room to be to continue to be aggressive. Although the gas prices going up the other way right now we\u2019re -- don\u2019t expect to see those kinds of outsized gas profits in the next quarter.","Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 46 on a reported basis 39 without gas deflation again our gas business accounted for nearly two-thirds of this Q2 year-over-year increase. But we also showed higher year-over-year margins in optical, hearing aids and pharmacy. The impact of the increasing executive membership was good is hit margins by 5 basis points or 2 basis points without gas deflation and again that\u2019s 2% reward feature this just generally reflects to continue to increase sales penetration from the executive remembers which again as I mentioned buy more and are more royal and shop more frequently.","LIFO in the second quarter we recorded a $4 million credit pre-tax compared to a $5 million pre-tax charge last year so about a penny a share or 3 basis points benefits year-over-year for 9 million to the gross margin. Moving on to SG&A our SG&A percentage Q2-over-Q2 was higher or worst by 11 basis points come in at 994 this year versus a 983 last year again we'll do the same four columns reported and without gas impact Q1 '15 then columns three and four Q2 '15 both reported and without gas. Five line items first one is core operations or just operations plus 8 basis points was reported in Q1 I mean and plus year is a positive mean lower year-over-year plus 15 without gas deflation and Q2 was a plus three and a plus 29 central minus and minus one and in Q2 minus 10 and minus 7 so higher year-over-year on that note. Stock compensation minus 11 and minus 11 and the minus 4 and minus 3 they are no quarterly adjustments so the last line item will be total again we reported a minus 4 or year-over-year SG&A higher by 4 basis points in Q1 both on a reported basis plus 4 or lower by 4 basis points in Q1 without gas deflation.","Again in Q2 higher or minus 11 basis points and then better or lower by 19 basis points. So plus 19 basis points without gas deflation another editorial on SG&A here again the operations component of SG&A was better by three in Q2 on a reported basis and better by 29 year-over-year excluding gas deflation. Again gasoline sales penetration and very low SG&A in the gas business certainly helps that number. Within operations excluding gas and other warehouse businesses and so taking all that out payroll benefits represented an improvement of 16 points of this 29 basis point improvement. So again strong sales overall certainly helped us improve payroll and benefits as well and get some leverage there.","Central expense was higher year-over-year by 10 or 7 without gas inflation as I mentioned earlier increased IT spending for monetization this was a 7 basis points on a reported basis 5 basis points without deflation in FX and lastly in both years we had a few discreet items to the tune of about minus 5 basis points but that is what it is. Finally with SG&A our stock compensation expenses I mentioned was higher or worst by 4 basis points on a reported basis three without gas deflation.","Next on the income statement line pre-opening expense, 8 million last year and 9 million this year. Last year we had three opening this year we had no opening but we got plenty of opening coming up so you have got quite of a bit of pre-opening expense rates starting in this also the little things that goes with that number no real surprises. Our total operating income for Q2 came in at 877 million 21% higher year-over-year or higher by 153 million compared to last year\u2019s 724 million in the quarter. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was essentially the same year-over-year coming at 26 million last year and 27 million this year. As I mentioned earlier interesting income and other was lower by 10 million coming in last year in the quarter of 30 million to the positive this year only 20 million to the positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by three the other swing was a minus 13 and again most of that relates to year-over-year swings and various FX things in this case I think the biggest piece was the revolution settlement of dollar payables U.S. dollar payables primarily in our Mexico operations I think that was a small positive in the last quarter.","Overall pre-tax income was higher by 20 or up 142 million from 728 million last year in the quarter to 870 million this year. In terms of income taxes our company tax rate this quarter came in at a needless to say on a reported basis at a very low 30.2% versus 35 over last year again the income tax line benefited primarily from a $57 million tax benefit in connection with the special cash dividend. Dividends paid on cost per share has helped by our employees in our foreign K plan which totaled about 29 million shares are deductable for U.S. income tax purposes and we recognized a one-time income tax benefit of approximately $57 million related to that as I mentioned there was an offset to that benefit of about 14 million after tax charge in the income tax line related to an outgoing income tax matter. Excluding these two items our Q2 tax rate this year was actually up would have been up a 10% to 35.1 just slightly higher compared to last year's 35.0 on a normal basis.","Overall reported net income was 463 last year compared to a reported 598 in net income this year again this year's net income on a reported basis was up 28%-29% taking out those two tax items up about 19%. For a quick rundown of other topics with a lot of the balance sheet as included in the morning\u2019s press release, a couple of balance sheet information items, depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled 260 million in the quarter and 514 million year-to-date, accounts payable ratio, accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis has shown improvement year-over-year from a 93% figure to a 97. There is a lot of construction payables in that it's showed a comparable improvement from an 83 if you just to merchandise -- accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories, merchandise accounts payable as a percent of merchandise inventories 83% last year up to 87% this year in the quarter.","Average inventory per warehouse was during the year flat coming in at 12.8 million this year on average per warehouse about $20,000 compared to a year ago so pretty much flat. FX year-over-year inventory levels were up -- would have been up about $350,000 or about 2.7% of sales on again an 8% sales increase. So, I think this control of our inventories and inventory is in good shape mid-year fiscals came in just fine because of the inventories.","I\u2019ll respond at this point to questions received in the past few months about the work slowdowns as you know on the West Coast ports. There is a week and a half ago I guess there was a new agreement, so things are getting back to order although the view is it will take four to eight weeks if not a little longer to get through the backup there, we like I am sure every other importer of containers, I try to identify which ones have priority where we can and really there is some pretty much the impact of that\u2019s over when we talk to our heads of merchandising in the different areas maybe using the tool we might probably got hit by $100 million-$200 million nothing to really speak off in terms of sales and there is probably a little worse for some others out there.","In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $555 million on CapEx, in Q2 we spend 619 million, so quarter-to-date just under a $1.2 billion. For the year, we still expect to be somewhere in the $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range, which is up from $2.0 billion last year. In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate it into four countries, U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico. We\u2019re also doing things not really online, but through Alibaba Tmall in Asia, but in terms of the four countries online there is costco.com, sales and profits needless to say were up during the quarter, sales were up 23% in the quarter, comp sales in the U.S. were similarly up right around 23%, foreign sales in the other three countries were up on a local currency basis 20 and more percent as well, but again with currencies being down there is some impact there, but overall continued good results of sales strength on our .com efforts.","In terms of expansion as I mentioned, we planned in Q3, to open three units including one relocation so a net of two and have current plans for 19 which includes one reload, so a net of 18 new in Q4. Assuming we opened those, we\u2019ll be at 28 net new units for the year or about 4.5% square footage growth and by country assuming we get to 28 it would be 17 in the U.S. so a little under two-thirds there, one in Canada, one in the UK, five in Asia, one in Korea, one in Taiwan and three in Japan, as well as one in Australia and three new in Mexico. As of Q2 end total square footage stood at 96.4 million square feet.","In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1 as you know we started the process about a little bit, we brought $18 million worth or 139,000 shares at an average price of a little over $126 a share. In Q2, we spended $92 million to buy 642,000 shares at an average price of 143.21, now a bunch of that was done before the dividend date for the $5 ex-dividend date.","In terms of dividends, our first quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or at a $1.42 per share annualized that leaves as total cost to company and about $630 million. This regular dividend of course was an addition to $5 per share dividend which amounted to $2.2 billion that we paid out last on February 27th and in fact both dividends were paid to shareholders on February 27th. As I mentioned, we also completed a one -- to pay impart for the $2.2 billion special dividend, we did a $1 billion debt offering a few weeks back that 500 million of five-year fixed and 500 million of seven-year fixed at attractive market rates.","Lastly just a couple of other items to note, the March comp sales reporting period for this year will include 34 selling days versus which is a day less than the 35 days last year, reflecting the calendar shift of the Easter holiday. And in addition beginning next month we will start reporting comp sales one day earlier than we have historically done so March comp sales will be announced on Wednesday, April 8th after the market close around 6 PM Pacific Time and 9 PM Eastern Time, hopefully that will help our East Coast friends and similarly our Q3 scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, May 27th for the 12 week third quarter ending May 10th. Again the release will occur at 6 PM Pacific Time, 9 PM Eastern Time that Wednesday with the earnings conference call still occurring the following morning.","Before I turn the call back to Brandy for Q&A, hopefully I have helped everyone understand some of the factors impacting the number. Overall, I think we had certainly the outsized gas profits helped, but there were lots of other little things that went the other way so overall still we felt pretty good a quarter and certainly strong sales membership renewal rates and alike.","With that, I'll turn it back to Brandy for any Q&A. Thank you. Hello.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom","I guess my first question is when you look at your gas business today clearly it's a bucket for you guys to pull funds and invest back in pricing for you guys to kind of be like Costco if you will. Is there a way to quantify that this quarter I mean clearly the core margins within the [indiscernible] of the business being down 3 basis points, was there some impact for you guys being more aggressive on price or if you can maybe just speak to arithmetically?","Richard Galanti","I think qualitatively it allowed us to be a little more aggressive we didn\u2019t just say, hey take this extra money and put it all there we didn\u2019t. We certainly benefited from in the quarter. And again it's not like we looked at this as that will be an offset to FX as an example because we know that FX has still got even if FX rates continue to stay where they are right now and don\u2019t get any relatively weaker it's still on a relative basis in Q3 and 4 maybe relatively weaker so yes we've recognized it Q3 and 4 will be a little more challenge in that regard but certainly food margins have been up a few instead of down a few probably but who knows.","Charles Grom","And then when you look to March of next year and then change in tenders because my understanding is roughly 750 million U.S. visa card holders today and there's roughly 50 million AMX holders today in the U.S. How bigger opportunity this could be for you guys to expand your membership base when you move into next year?","Richard Galanti","Well we'll see I mean there's a lot of unknowns, the first order business is for Citi to work with American Express and figure out the account portfolio a lot hinges on that we expect that to happen but there's no guarantees and there'll be -- and again there's a lot I'd like to tell you there's a lot we'll figure it out now. We know the bucket of dollars if you will in our mind of what we can use to drive usage of that kind of card to recognizing there'll be some cannibalization somebody that has a visa mileage card in their wallet. They may want to use that instead. Just like there is cannibalization now there's people who use a non-cobranded AMX card. Similarly there'll be other places where there's outside spend increase because your neighborhood drycleaner one card is accepted and another card is not, so there's lots -- I think there's lots of opportunities we have to get there first and first order business is the transition itself and there'll be a lot more to say once we get there.","Charles Grom","And then just last question on e-commerce up 23% in the quarter, can you just remind us number of skews online today relative to a year ago? And where you think that can go? How much is costing through your depots versus not and then just margins on e-commerce relative to the clubs? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","That is probably approaching 8,000 regular skews and excluding from that that we have a lot of tyre skews based on all the sizes we've got a lot of office product skews through a third-party but core skews on our side is 8,000 probably 1,500 plus more than a year ago and I'm guessing there but that's probably a big number. And then those increases are a lot of sundries items, some apparel items things like that probably gets you to come back on a more frequent basis and smaller ticket items a lot of the items a lot of the items we have added are items like I've mentioned versus $300 to $2,000 televisions and furniture sets.","Charles Grom","Any color on profitability?","Richard Galanti","Excuse me?","Charles Grom","Just as margins in the e-commerce business?","Richard Galanti","Margins overall are probably are a shade lower SG&A is a lot lower so profitability wise e-commerce is a very profitable operation relative to the company as a whole.","Operator","Your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So Richard two part question to get kind of the same thing you've got some very busy clubs and you keep increasing traffic mid single-digit every year and you guys spend a lot of time looking at kind of quality of experience in the club in maybe different parts of the club right like fresh and with that in mind is there an opportunity to open more clubs in the U.S. than you might have thought before maybe cannibalize yourselves gain share improve the experience if some of them are too crowded have you guys done work on that?","Richard Galanti","Well yes in a lot of different ways but not in terms of let's sit down and do that today at one-time I mean first of all quality of experience as you I think know I'm sure you know our operators and our merchants are in the warehouses a lot create and a random set of merchandising and operating victims just spend two days shopping around part of the country visiting warehouses both us in competition and other things and looking in the sites, so I think certainly the member responses that we get every day the types of throughput for hours and front end registers all those things go into that and I got to tell when a member writes a little complaint then that could be nasty just a complaint it just hurt and recognizing we\u2019re always been have some challenges. So we're constantly looking for that experience and we're constantly looking for that to get you out of there faster and to make it a better experience.","I got to tell you we still get probably more positive than negatives in terms of e-mails that are sent in to senior management about positive experience as with a member with a particular employee who they have helped in a warehouse something like that and beyond so we have no illusion that we do everything right but we're pretty steadfast of looking all those things in terms of really deliverable units absolutely I mean if you would have ask me five years ago when we're opening about 20 units a year and probably I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me we're probably it is 70-30 U.S. and you said Richard five year heads where you are going be and I'd say well we're going to be about 30 and we actually got there pretty close. And if it's 70-30 U.S. backed then it's probably 50-50 heading into 30-70 over the next five years and here we are almost 50-40 still in U.S. I think that\u2019s a reflection of we're finding probably more opportunities that we thought possible some of it's what you mentioned openly up in busy that quality of experience the units that are 250 and 300 and even the 300 plus trying to get those in trying to balance that because cannibalization does cause a little heartburn per year. But a lot of it also is as I think surprising how many units we can put in some of the newer markets so that newer is a relative term newer markets over the last -- in markets that we've been in for the last five or 10 years. So I think it's a combination of all that again last year I think of the 20 in fact I have it here hold on, of the, here it is of the 20 -- in fiscal \u201913 I am sorry last year of the 29 net openings we had I think 16 were in the U.S. and this year of the 29 or 16 or 17 were in the U.S. a little over half and this year it's what did I say 17 out of 28 so almost two-thirds and so I think you'll probably five years from now as we go from let\u2019s say 30 to 35 probably still half are in the U.S and then we are finding more opportunities.","John Heinbockel","Do you think you can get to a 1,000 there ultimately or have you gone out that far?","Richard Galanti","Well we haven\u2019t gone out that far as yet yes if we added 30 year for 10 years around a sense there so yes I think so but certainly not out of the relm.","John Heinbockel","And then secondly what the though at least it seems like anecdotally maybe in certain items or categories there may be Kirkland introduced maybe the brand or a brand is no longer carried. I don\u2019t think there is a conscious effort to although the quality and value Kirkland certainly outstrips a lot of the brands. A conscious effort to get more Kirkland items in the store more space to them is there a conscious effort or that\u2019s just kind of it happens you put in it is where the demand is and so maybe it squeezes out some brands along the way?","Richard Galanti","Well I think there is an ongoing conscious effort to there are people that are in charge of coming up with new Kirkland stuff in each merchandize category and their job is to try to find new things just like any buyers job is to find good exciting branded items. And ultimately an item it is our cousin it has got the name on it but it has to live and die like any other item I think if we've added 30 or 40 items in the past 12 or 18 months that should we subtracted 20 or 30 that ultimately did work out when though we bring back some a few years later that worked better I remember years ago we had a organic peanut butter Kirkland team ensured that didn\u2019t set the world on fire. I think we're now testing again and it's a pretty good item. But we'll see how long pretty good means. So it has to -- we recognize the strength of our concept is both KS and brand and I don\u2019t think we if you said Richard you are in the mid 20s now in terms of KS do you ever see going to 50 I\u2019d have to stretch I mean even our own members internally will say how can we get it from 25 to 30 there is no formal game plan how many years is that going to take what items work and certainly there is a not a lot of low hanging fruit there is lots of $20 million and $30 million and $50 million overtime. Not a lot of 300 million and 400 million items like paper goods or water and things like that or K stuffs.","John Heinbockel","Okay thank you.","Richard Galanti","And last comment before getting to the next question out there in terms of cannibalization even if that\u2019s ramped up a little bit. I was just looking over the last few years if you go back to fiscal '13 what we called cannibalization that\u2019s just not just here that\u2019s opening three units in Japan and that affects three or five other Japanese units. Total cannibalization in fiscal '13 was 65 basis points and \u201914, 58 and for the first half of this year it looks like it's about something in the low 40s so it\u2019s going to fluctuate between 35 and 75 depending on what we do and where we do it, but my guess is something in the 40 to 50 range is kind of -- we\u2019ll have to be able to move that number overall a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","My first question is related to the gas business, can you just give us an update on where the comp gallons were in the quarter, where gas is as a percentage of total sales? And then you mentioned that the gas margin would start to be little bit less favorable given where price is, what prices is doing. Can you help us just to understand kind of what the excess margin may have been in EPS this quarter?","Richard Galanti","Yes, look it was just on that line item it was two-thirds of the margin improvement of all ancillary businesses. It could be 200 plus basis points of extra margin, I mean our margin in gas on a daily basis over the years could be anywhere from a zero to a five or six and it's all over the Board might even be a little bit higher sometimes, but it really ranges and frankly when it's a little higher, we\u2019re saving the customer more money. In terms of gallon it comes I remember for a couple of years when the U.S. overall not Costco, but all U.S. vehicle gallons consumption was in the low single-digits and maybe in the -- when the bad economy hit and went to the low negative single-digits and we went from, we remained at four, five, six, seven. Right now we\u2019re in the mid-teens. So, we\u2019re getting a lot of people coming into Costco to buy gas and that certainly drives them into the warehouse as well.","Dan Binder","And then on the IT spend, you mentioned I think you said it was $0.02 this quarter as you look at Q3 and Q4, what do you expect that in fact look like?","Richard Galanti","It's hard to guess completely, I know we\u2019ve had a couple of some of the original modules and modules makes it sound like it's a small number, these are big numbers but then you have projects that are $50 million-$60 million projects that the day you are put into service they then over the next in our case 55 four week periods over the next five years generally you take a little under a $1 million a month hit and so some of those are starting to hit so my guess is that much it will is it that much is a little less a little more it is hard to say but still over a several year period incrementally recognizing your denominator sales keep getting bigger too, but with that bigger sales we had indicated something in low to mid-teens of basis points I could be off by a couple of basis points but and they achieve.","Dan Binder","And then my last question is related to organics, can you just give us an update on how many that skews are on in the club at this point and what the mix is of sales and how that performed in the quarter, how are you thinking about that business going forward?","Richard Galanti","Yes, it's still a small percentage of Costco, it's a rising but it's a fast growing area as it is with a lot of other retailers as well. You're are going to see more and more of it a part of that is availability there is -- we could sell -- we and everybody else can sell a lot more if there was more out there. I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of winding up our sourcing and I think I mentioned last quarter that for all of \u201914 organic was like approaching 3 billion which was more than twice when it was two years earlier or a year and a half earlier. It's growing fast, I don\u2019t know if it is 50% a year, but it is certainly growing at a high and a low mid or mid double-digit number and it's great for us because we show even a better value on that stuff than some of the things that it replaces when we can do organic ground beef I mean for everybody football is regular ground beef and everybody makes lower than average margin this is the item that everybody tries to make more on, and so we can make a little more not a lot more and show a greater value to our member. So it will keep growing, I am sorry I can\u2019t be more specific.","Operator","Your next question is from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Mark Becks","Hi, it's Mark Becks on for Chris. Congrats on the fantastic quarter. Just a follow-up on a couple of Chuck's questions, actually, so it doesn't look like you are getting into too much specifics about the change in the credit card to AMEX, et cetera. Just curious what has been the response that you've seen from our friends up north? I knew that changed over in January -- maybe what the reception has been there?","Richard Galanti","Well it's been good so far, I mean we\u2019re getting a lot of people to switch, recognizing it\u2019s peoples membership card as well and if anything our view of the U.S. should be -- I guess I can\u2019t get into a lot of it right now. We wouldn\u2019t have done this if we thought there was a lot of risk associated with it, we think it's a big positive over a long period of time, but recognize big positive to us means giving most of it back to the customer in this case most of it back to the co-branded user of a credit card and that\u2019s going to happen -- we\u2019re really not going to be able to tell you a lot about it for a number of months.","Mark Becks","Okay. I guess I'll switch back to the gas prices then. Historically, the adage has been you guys benefit when prices go up, but it looks like just based on gallonages and miles driven, which has only been up a couple percent, so you guys are actually capturing a lot more share now then in history period. Is that something you would agree with?","Richard Galanti","Yes there is two places to that just so everybody understands. When prices go up, we make less and save the customer we still save them but save them less. When prices go down, we save them more and we make more. Certainly price is going down, we save the customer more and that's positive and we make a little more or a lot more right that's changed in the last few weeks, but we made a lot more in the last few quarters. If you go -- the other thing the thing I think you're talking about is when it was in the press everyday as prices went from $3 to $4 to $4 plus a gallon it was on the news every night in every city, that helped us I think. The offset to that would be as prices are less important, how can that help you? I don\u2019t know other than it is and it is a lot because our gallon is quite a bit up.","Mark Becks","Did you see what the volume and gallonage was\/ I think it was, call it, up 11% last quarter?","Richard Galanti","It was in the mid-teens I think we mentioned.","Mark Becks","So pretty big acceleration there and just finally on geography -- go ahead, sorry.","Richard Galanti","Just getting back to that comment I think people ask us why I think it's because we do a good job of being the most competitively priced and there's that third-party as gasbuddy.com that 40 whatever million people and put their price on what they bought gas for. For three years in a row since they started announcing best overall low price out there by $0.14 a gallon or $0.16 a gallon across the country, now you're going to and that's not every station every day everywhere but on average with all those data points we're it and I think that kind of publicity helps us as well.","Mark Becks","And then just the last question on geographical differences, it looks like you called out the Midwest and the South areas as the strongest obviously, a lot of moving pieces there, with the Chinese New Year as a help, but then the port shutdowns, which on our math comes out to 60 basis points roughly. Maybe just what you are seeing, elaborate a little bit geography, and then maybe the Northeast? I know we have seen some pretty severe weather here as of late? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Well look I think you summed up or re-summed up on the port strike in the Lunar New Year switch -- I think the big deal is weather has played a role although it did last year as well, but relative to New York, the Northeast as an example the four weeks that complies February the first two weeks were mid positive say normal after weeks were mid negative single-digit that's a huge swing but other areas did just fine and the Texas region got hammered in the last week with weather but overall we're -- it's been, we've done okay.","Operator","Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","A couple quick ones, on the credit card, I know you not going to share a lot of details. Is there -- besides probably some savings just from some slower interchange fees or credit card fees, is there any elevators, such that if there are certain volumes met, you could see further benefits down the road? Or is this the lower fees, you will see a benefit upfront? And then from there, just how much business you do?","Richard Galanti","As you're asking I'm looking at my wall behind me and there's a handwritten note from many years ago when our securities counsel is sitting here and quickly somebody's asking a question he wrote we have no comment beyond the release and then the reality is that there's lots of buttons that you push on these agreements there's all aspects of it at the end of the day whatever our current arrangement as we look at it whatever our current arrangement is with our current provider both what we pay what we receive to offset some of that what our member using that co-brand cardholder is rewarded with a premise of how much is that to start with where we think it can go to at the end of the day we can whatever that bucket of money is it can go towards lowering merchant fees raising rewards or using some other place in our company and we'll figure it out there's we think that's it's an exciting bucket and we'll do a lot with it but just like I've told people in the past if we can save the dollar on buying a product better whether it's detergent or coffee or anything or due to packaging or raw materials cost or energy cost we're going to give $0.80-$0.90 back to the customer and rest assured there'll be whenever benefit x is a little bit of will accrue to our P&L and a lot of it will accrue to the member in some way shape or form but none of that can really be -- we can\u2019t really tell you until next year.","Simeon Gutman","On membership, I know you don't say a lot on international versus U.S., but can you just speak directionally to whatever growth rate you are seeing in membership, whatever trend line has been occurring, how has that -- has it changed much? Is it the same in the U.S. versus international?","Richard Galanti","It's higher international because we're newer we didn\u2019t save -- and I think I've shared in the past I mean if you take the total number of members divided by our total number of warehouses you've got roughly 59,000 to 60,000 member households per warehouse in Japan you've got a number that has it's a three digit number it's in the low hundreds you also have a lower renewal rate in those first few years so it tends to bounce out overtime but we operate overall in other countries on a membership fee as a higher percent of sales particularly in Asia.","Simeon Gutman","But whatever prevailing growth rate there has been in membership in the U.S., up until second quarter or up until the first -- meaning, has that run rate stayed the same in the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","Yes and a lot of it is dictated by new openings and again it's going to be dictated more by what I said in new member signups in the quarter were up 9%. There have been times when it\u2019s been almost flat but prior are down a little bit because a year earlier in that quarter you opened three units in Asia where you might have and again I talked about an average of roughly 60,000 member households per location. We had locations that will have new member signups as of opening day and that as of day mean during the 8 or 10 or 12 weeks prior to opening when their parking lot is kind of set and we have the flags and the tabling activities out front side you could have anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 members signed up now 40% of them renew a year later but in terms of new members coming in and buying a membership and that really distorts that number. So I don\u2019t know how much meaning is that plus 9 is a function that as well but we always point that out.","Simeon Gutman","And then just very quickly, can you just remind us of the e-commerce business, is there other member-only items or is there items someone can just -- who is not a member can just come on the website and purchase as well?","Richard Galanti","In this crazy world there are some items that we have online where we've agreed not to show the price unless you are a member.","Simeon Gutman","Not to show the price but the only person who is buying on your Web site is a member?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Operator","And your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I wanted to just touch on membership as well. Certainly, with consistent and strong traffic and you certainly are saving people money at the pump, how are you thinking about the value proposition of your membership currently in the U.S. and international? What may be the timeline in terms of you kind of reassessing what you think the value of the membership should be?","Richard Galanti","I think round about what you're asking about when do we see this I think the possibility of our fee change historically that\u2019s really we think about last. We drive prices and value everyday in everything we do and I mean it you go to our budget meetings every four weeks you got a day and a half of that time or a third of time is merchants and we\u2019re figuring out how to improve the value and lower the price and raise the quality. And historically using U.S. and Canada as 80% of our business first of all and probably 80ish and a little different than that number pretty close in terms of percent of members you have -- we have done a fee increase about every five or six years the last time we did was very late '11 very early '12. So most of the calendar year of '12 those renewals been a first time in five or six years saw the increase from 50 to 55 and from 100 to 110 on the executive in the U.S. and Canada if history repeats itself five to six years from January of '12 will be January of '17 into January of '18. So that again based on history it doesn\u2019t mean we are going to do it or not going to do it. We've chosen generally the whole membership fees at whatever their prices are mostly of the countries impart because it's so darn strong to start with and why not continue to drive the business. And so again I think it's generally the last thing we look at but something we've looked at regularly over 30 years and I'm sure we'll look at it again at and when time tends right.","Paul Trussell","And then just circling back to gas profitability and I know you have addressed this a few times on the call, but given the spread between the Street's forecast and the actual for 2Q, I just wanted to touch back on your comments around the third quarter. You mentioned that gas prices have started to trickle back up, but frankly, can you help us just kind of think about our expectations for the back half of the year? Should it be closer to a more normalized cadence around gasoline profitability or do you continue to see a little bit of tailwind, given the favorable mix?","Richard Galanti","Well if you look at history when we each quarter for the last several years we\u2019ll share with people that gas helped us a little hurt us a little helped us a lot hurt us a lot. It's virtually all -- it's pretty much in proportion with the trend of gas prices per gallon. And so as you know in the constant to drive down has stopped and went up a little bit. So a lot of that party is now behind us for right now and but I can't really tell you what is going to be other than historically that\u2019s what it's been.","Operator","Your next question is line Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","First question relates to the special dividend. I guess this is our first conference call since you announced the last one. What the prior special dividend that was around the time of tax policy change and many companies pursued that tack. As you take a bigger picture look now at capital allocation, understanding that you did accelerate the stock buyback a bit, how are you thinking about special dividends, perhaps as a recurring element of capital allocation? And any other light you want to shed on your decision to issue that one last week?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean we now have two data points instead of one we did it and you're right the motivation or one of the motivations could be really the one we did it was reading about in the Wall Street Journal everyday and just before people expected a dividend tax rates is automatically, so it make sense to be not only shareholder friendly but shareholder friendly a way that might help people as well if tax rates were going to change and we feel active about that. I think we appreciated the fact that it was perceived as being shareholder friendly, as you might expect both management and the Board wanted to be in that regard and it's not like we sat down and did this giant study exactly when how much and what should we do, I think we liked it the first time and it seems like our shareholders liked it the second time. And that\u2019s how we clearly worry about it and there a little on dependent of each other.","I think that when we did the first one which was a little over $3 billion worth it was quite sizeable it was a time when I guess in retrospect we could have bought some more stock back it have been a smart thing to do given where it's at now. We want to -- we tend to do both and we tend to look at all things, first and foremost CapEx, how through we ramp-up CapEx and we\u2019ve done that. Second would be our regular dividend, what are we going to do with that every year again there is no guarantees, but in each of the last spring periods over the last nine years I think we\u2019ve raised it on average around 13.5%. We looked as you know premiere models and our models we are generating more cash than we can use in CapEx and so we\u2019ll continue to look at ways to the shareholders run rate. But there is no reason of thinking that will be two year sense we\u2019ll do another one, there is always a thing we will mostly.","Matthew Fassler","It's interesting even though you're running with several billion dollars of cash on the balance sheet, you haven't gotten to the debt markets, which I understand is opportunistic. Should we think about the cash balance that you have today as something that you feel you need to be comfortable with or is that a number that you could whittle down over time?","Richard Galanti","I think it is a number that you wrote down mind you, I am looking at quarter end and this number might be a shade different than the balance sheet number, but I think we had cash and short-term investments was across this number there, hold on a second, cash in short-term investments at the end of the quarter of 7.4 billion roughly and add a number that wasn\u2019t completely consolidated of like 7.2, but if you look at that roughly 7.4 number about 2.5 is really cash in the U.S. another 2.5-3 is real cash outside the U.S. where we\u2019re spending it frankly. In addition we announced last year that we brought back some of the cash in Canada. So, I think we can withheld the number down but some of its cash equivalent, if you think about from the time base close on Friday night, so the time they open on Monday morning all those debit and credit card receivables which could be upwards of a $1 billion, $1.5 billion, 1 billion plus that is cash equivalent, but is not cash.","Matthew Fassler","And then just a very quick follow-up, we are seeing the LIFO creep up. I know it's only a couple basis points, but it's a nice change from year ago, when, I guess, you peaked out at around 8 basis points hit. Could you just talk about what the moving pieces are in driving that? And I know you feel like you are fully marked at the end of any given quarter, but if you had to place bets on which direction it would go for the rest of the year, it would be very helpful?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know, gas has come up a little bit, although it's still below where it was at the beginning of the year, so that is still probably LIFO as of today it is LIFO creditable, I don\u2019t think it's going to be a big giant number either way, but it's a little bit of attraction at this point. Yes, you were right about it Matt, a point of that is some proteins are inflationary right now for not always is related and some other things we\u2019re just starting to see what beginnings of some deflationary pressure on items manufactured in the oil, plastic bags and alike, so some of that is starting to finally flow through so there will be some things that are inflationary and some that are deflationary.","Operator","Your next question is line Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Market.","Kelly Bania","I am not sure if it's too early to ask this, but just curious about the members that you brought in via the Living Social promotion several months ago just curious if you are tracking them? Are they following that typical spending pattern of a new member in terms of spending and frequency?","Richard Galanti","I'm going to plead because I don\u2019t know the answer to that, but we hold that question for next quarter I promise we'll have some numbers. I know that we're tracking it and I just don\u2019t have the detail on it. I know that on average, they're a little younger. I don\u2019t know spend habits.","Kelly Bania","Then just another one, you mentioned the Bay Area as I think a strong region either in the quarter or for the month. I know that's an area where you have more robust offering in organics and I was just curious if that's part of it? And maybe how plans are to kind of bring that more robust organic offering to some more clubs in the rest of the country?","Richard Galanti","Well and that's probably a little piece of it. I think weather overall has helped. The West Coast is as bad as it's been in Texas and the Midwest and the East Coast it's been offsettingly good over on our side of the country. And I'm sure that's helped some. Clearly I think some of the merchandising efforts we've done on organic have helped. Part of that, we are doing it more in other parts of the country. Part of it is supply issues and it will still take time for that to grow.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","I want to get back to e-commerce and maybe the ancillary services ex-gas and just explore I know I think you said that the margins are great. Did you give us a number on how big e-commerce is?","Richard Galanti","No, it's -- do you mean total size of e-commerce?","Scott Mushkin","Yes.","Richard Galanti","It's about 3% of our total.","Scott Mushkin","3% of your total sales?","Richard Galanti","Yes on an annualized basis, I think last year was like 2.9 or something, 3 billion and growing at 20%.","Scott Mushkin","3 billion growing 20%-25%. And then from a gross margin perspective, I mean that how do we think about SG&A associated with that business? Is there much of it? I mean is it like fractional a couple percent? I mean how do we think of SG&A when you look -- I know a lot of the stuff just goes directly to the consumer about 60% of it. Is there really a lot of SG&A associated?","Richard Galanti","No there's -- margins are let me just look here, margins are a shade lower not a lot and SG&A is a lot lower.","Scott Mushkin","And then from a philosophical perspective -- everyone has always ragged on or not ragged on that's a bad way to say it, everyone's always -- some people have criticized Costco because they don't let enough flow through to shareholders. How do we think about that? I think the gross margins are what you are saying are a little bit lower. SG&A is a lot lower, so net-net we got much better operating profit in the e-commerce business. Is that okay with the Company or is that something that you would try to make look like the rest of the business?","Richard Galanti","No I mean we're a retailer, there's different part of it. No, we're happy to make a little more there. We're still making first and foremost are we as competitive as we can be relative to others and we feel that we are very competitive. We are also recognizing that e-commerce is supported by the buying sites of the warehouses as we brought in line electronics and furniture and some of those bigger ticket categories that buying strength, how do you compensate -- how does e-commerce if you will compensate to that so it's all part of the same thing. The fact it's margins overall are a little lower than the warehouses I think it's indicative -- it's a function of that and we'll continue to do that. We work on strong profits in some of the other ancillary businesses but they also have different either cost associated with it or purchasing powers. Pharmacies of course you got pharmacist and pharmacy techs that make more than average hourly employees, so you got a higher cost structure there as well as all the regulatory and billing stuff going on in that business so we work on a higher margin to offset some of that and but we also work on a profitability number that's good so it's all part of the equation if you will.","Scott Mushkin","So then just one last one. So I think you said you are up to 8,000 SKUs. One of the things we think benefits Costco hugely on the e-commerce is that you are basically letting me use your people to do the shopping for me. In other words like the fact that there isn't 2 million skews like there is on Walmart's site I think is a great attribute. So what's your thought about where the SKU count goes, kind of balancing Costco being a personal shopper versus wanting more maybe more SKUs? Where do you think it goes?","Richard Galanti","I think it probably goes up a little bit but not a lot, the fact that it went from 4,000 to 8,000 or something in the last few years is a lot, but part of that was just trying to drive business adding some categories to get people -- for people to think of it as top of mind or near top of mind instead of not at all. If I have to think about and comment from very loyal shareholder and somebody who loves Costco with three kids at home three teenagers and said look I love Costco and I know when I go into a warehouse I know I'm going to get the 10 items I planned to get in the food and sundries area and the other 10 that I didn\u2019t plan to get but I know I'm going to come out with 20 I'm going to be sated I know I'm going to have great food samples I know we have three other things in nonfood area that I have no plan to get and I'm excited about that but I knew going in I was going to get three items or four items that I didn\u2019t plan on getting.","So I don\u2019t know why when do I go to costco.com so part of our challenge in the last year on costco.com is not only driving sales of those bigger physical ticket bigger dollar ticket and physical ticket items that not everybody wants to shop home like furniture and big screen TVs and had a great price and in many cases write about service delivery and we're driving that business. But also how we just did it more regularly and whether it's take ups in other items for your office or home or some apparel items. As you know the 5.5 million KS restaurants that we sell every year which is a great value if you always joked if you really tall with short runs we can assort you because we don\u2019t sell all the sizes and collar combinations online we do. So trying to get different reasons to get you under the state more often is part of the equation here and nothing we're doing pretty job of doing that. I don\u2019t see and you said Richard you're taking again 15,000 one day I don\u2019t see it in my near future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","I just had a bigger picture question about holiday. Did you have -- would you prioritize any major learnings from holiday in terms of where you might look to do things differently next year? And then on the core merchandising margins number, what should we look at as helpful drivers for that positively going forward? Or what kind of run rate might we expect there? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","What's the second part of that question?","Oliver Chen","The core merchandise margins. What are some of the positive drivers we should look for in terms of optimism on the core merchandise margins, whether it be inventory control. Or is the run rate at a slight negative kind of realistic for us to model?","Richard Galanti","We didn\u2019t say we don\u2019t provide on the latter part we don\u2019t provide specific direction on that area. I remember several years ago when our margins were just down year-over-year every quarter for a couple of years and every quarter we'd say margins are fine. We can tweak them a little bit if we want and where we want to I think that sentence and that response is still there I think we continue to get excited by strong sales and strong loyalty and strong conversion to executive member. And all those things will continue to take front seat to a little margin improvement. But if we want to get a little bit we think we can while still being very competitive. In terms of what do we learn or not learn during the holiday.","I think when we look back I think we did a pretty good job of planning for the port slowdowns and arguably it's probably easier to do a better job when you're managing fewer items. And so while we felt that we got hurt by a little bit I think we probably mitigated that hurt. Beyond that again I think we are comfortable when raw materials, prices, and bakery and food court and the alike go up that we're not going to change our prices and if it hurt our margin a little bit it hurts it we can get elsewhere. So I don\u2019t think this was given our strength we didn\u2019t they weren\u2019t a lot of things to necessary learn as it relates to did sales soften and we drive more sales by more mark down just something I think we thought we had came out of this season pretty good. And if anything continues to be aggressive in terms of price of the products the price points of products that our member wants great value or great items and we'll continue to drive the value proposition in upscale items.","Oliver Chen","And inventories were nicely growing versus the sales, like underpinning sales. Is that a trend we should also model going forward in terms of the spread being neutral?","Richard Galanti","Probably a little bit again I wouldn\u2019t read too much into one quarter. For a number of years here we've generally again taking FX gas out of it the four walls of warehouse inventories that on a non-FX diluted or increased basis. Generally speaking we've had sales greater than inventory per warehouse increases if sales were up 8 or 9 inventories were up five or six. I think my guess is Q2 was a little better than we thought but it not's going to drive a little bit but still trending in a positive ratio there.","Oliver Chen","In our last question, you gave a lot of great details on the e-commerce and the evolution there. What about flexible store fulfillment and reserve and pick up and ship from store. Is that on the horizon? Is it something your customer appreciates and will that be a material driver of traffic? At some competitors, e-com contributes 100 basis points or more to comp.","Richard Galanti","Well 23% of growth on 3 billion is like 60 or whatever 500 million. So that\u2019s like little under half a percent of comp to the company. First of all we don\u2019t do it right now with the exception of the 8 or 9 Costco business centers that we have that we both to delivered and order for pick up several things we\u2019re testing like Google and the cart are something enhancement, it's not like you can\u2019t call Costco, or online Costco and say I want to order this stuff and I\u2019ll come and pick it up. So, I don\u2019t know if our member appreciates it, I know there is a lot of effort out they are doing it, our first order business is get -- we just are installing the membership module which includes a lot of hooks to things, but I don\u2019t see us doing that certainly in the next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","One, have you seen any evidence that gas prices correlate either to customers' willingness to spend more on food, sundries, and hardlines in your stores or your ability to sign up more members at your Clubs when gas prices are either moving up or moving down?","Richard Galanti","Well, it used to be when prices were moving up and it was the topic du jour every night on the -- from the consumer product and the consumer activist on the local news station, when were prices were skyrocketing is when we saw some real signups related to in that market. Conversely you see less of that right now, certainly we\u2019re seeing and the answer is I don\u2019t know completely, but certainly we\u2019re seeing more traffic to the gas stations, more and continued strong shopping frequency in the four walls of the warehouse and some of that\u2019s got to be related that but I couldn\u2019t tell you how much.","Michael Lasser","And my second question is on the credit card. Can you give us a sense of what the private-label credit card penetration is in your Clubs?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t think we disclosed that, total credit card, in U.S. total credit card is about 40, debit is about 40, cash, check and other is about 20.","Michael Lasser","But presumably a big portion is private label?","Richard Galanti","Probably and certainly more than half but there are people that choose even using our credit thing, there are people that choose to get star reward points or drop the points on a different AMEX card than the Costco one. Our goal though is to certainly drive more of it and we have successfully historically and hope we can do that in the future to drive more of it to this top of the wallet card.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. There is no response form that line, we\u2019ll move to the next question. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Just have two questions for you. The first one is when you look at the impact of FX this quarter throughout the P&L, can you just help us understand a little better, like what we should expect both on MFI and on SG&A over the coming quarters as we look at the foreign exchange where we are today? And the second question is, with gas prices rising a bit over the past few weeks, are you adjusting the merchandise pricing that quickly to reflect the movement in gas, as you were opportunistic this quarter. With gas prices going up, will you change things as we go into the next few weeks, given the rising prices?","Richard Galanti","The answer to last one is no and again I am not -- I can\u2019t tell you how exactly what, when, where and how, but did it give us a little bit of cover to be aggressive? Yes. Did it give us a lot? No, it gave us a lot of cover, but we choose not use it. So, I mean it's not like we\u2019re going to say, hey, let's take all this and go use it. So yes, as gas profits come down that was probably our improvement, it so happen in this quarter where is that pointed out all those other things, some of which we will continue doing it, you guys can figure out FX based on where the currencies of each country are. If it weakens a little bit relative to dollar from a year ago, it is a little more impactful, if it weakens little less, it's a less gradual but still with a negative front of it. Yes, interest income and others that little bit of a crapshoot. It goes both ways. Gas now is going to be less outsize profitable in the coming quarters and there is another reason hopefully that sales will continue to drive in the right direction. I think overall, I look at Q2 and taking all the good of gas out and the negatives and sort of other things some of that will go away in Q3, but if we can drive sales frequently we\u2019ll be fine. I am going to take two more calls.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Melich","Two questions, one is -- and I realize there's a lot of moving pieces, but if you were to look at gas and how much that helps EPS this quarter, could you give a range or if it was $0.10. And then sort of think about it going forward, if gas was steady, is that something you have to cycle, it comes back, or is it something that is a new plan? And then my other question was on gross margin. I think I heard you say that in ancillary, there was pharmacy and maybe something else where there was some margin expansion. Could you help explain that, if I heard that right? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Sure we're not going give specifics on gas it was very profitable a little bit of it could be an offset to other margins a lot of it is just outsized but then we also had a few other things that went the other way and so that outsize this was a little less outside. In terms of gross margin optical and hearing aids again just looking just like I say in the core gas was the big one but several other key businesses, ancillary businesses also had slightly improving margins year-over-year pharmacy optical and hearing aid.","Gregory Melich","And what drove that? Was there a mix issue or --?","Richard Galanti","I think some of it is driving sales a big chunk of it driving sales I think on hearing aids and I'm guess here because I don\u2019t know our success of purple signature which is a incredible value and quality I am told that the penetration that\u2019s huge generally we make more margin and save the customer more money on our private label. But I'm guessing it that way.","Gregory Melich","And I guess just because it is linked a little bit, where are we now with inflation for the whole store? If you were to roll it together? Does it meet enough in electronics now and all that kind of stuff?","Richard Galanti","Year-to-date we're about a 0.5% deflationary and that\u2019s a LIFO index for U.S. inventory, so what we're all like items cost update one of the fiscal year and one of these same items cost us on day 180 or so whatever this year and if day one it was 100.00 at the end of 24 weeks it was 0.995 so literally 0.5% you had a little bit of inflation in for sundries and apparel and domestics. You had deflation as you expect in majors you had deflation in gas and you had deflation in foods a little bit sundries are up a little food was down a little.","Gregory Melich","That\u2019s tough.","Richard Galanti","Not a lot of deflation.","Operator","And your final question comes from line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory. ","Joe Feldman ","Wanted to just ask about international for a moment, I think you have been in Spain now for about a year. Just was curious for a little update there, update on what you are thinking about new countries. I believe France was going to be next. And also just more generally, just store productivity. When you are opening internationally, are you still kind of achieving and exceeding the targets that you have set out?","Richard Galanti","In Asia and Australia historically achieved and exceeded recognizing whenever you are in a new country. And as go back I use to depend as an example 15, 18 years ago 15 years. Our original plan there was over a unit a year for five years and just achieved breakeven at the end of your five I think we ended up opening six in five years and we achieved breakeven at the end of year four roughly. And a lot of that has do with you have got a 5 plus million plus a year net on central expense, buyers, and carry department. Small IT department you name it and then of course all the efficiencies are starting up memberships wide were doing great in Spain. We have one unit mind you sales wise we're under our plan but it's starting to finally grow nicely. I think now that we're here to say we've got two openings planned for the rent remaining part of this calendar year both of them are in the mid grid area and one in September and one is later that year. I think that both in the fall and again what we find even if it's a different city once we're there you start getting more local vendors willing to sell you because we're going be around and you get a little more play in the press. Yes we'll see but we feel good about going so far, France we\u2019re still at least a year away for opening I think when we first set down four or so years ago the view was is that Spain would take three to five years and France would take three to eight years and it is. So it is a long run out process of permitting and the whole appeals process over there by third-parties.","Richard Galanti","Well thank you and I thank you for listening for an hour and a half. And have a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"6024":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q1 2019 Results Conference Call December 13, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Michael Lasser - UBS","Simon Goodwin - Morgan Stanley","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Chris Horvers - JP Morgan","Karen Short - Barclays","Edward Kelly - Wells Fargo","Rupesh Parikh - Oppenheimer","Scot Ciccarelli - RBC Capital Market","Scott Mishkin - Wolfe","Operator","Hi, my name is Liz, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to this Costco Q1, 2019 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed in mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Liz, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law. In today\u2019s press release, we reported our operating results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and the 12 weeks that ended this past November 25th.","Net income for the quarter came in at $767 million or $1.73 a share, a 19.3% per share increase compared to $640 million or $1.45 per share last year in the first quarter. In comparing year-over-year operating results, there were three items noted in the release. One, this year's first quarter benefitted from $59 million or $0.13 per share income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. Last year, the benefit was $41 million or $0.09 a share in the first quarter last year.","And number two, the Company also recognized an additional tax benefit this year of $27 million or $0.06 a share. This related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act. And the third item noted in the release, this year's first quarter results included a charge of $43 million pre-tax, or $31 million after tax, which is $0.07 a share for an adjustment to our estimate of breakage rewards for the Citi\/Visa co-branded credit card program, and more on this in our discussion of gross margin.","In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $34.31 billion, 10.3% increase over the $31.12 billion reported last year in the first quarter. In terms of comp sales and the release today, for the 12 week fiscal first quarter, U.S. comp sales on a reported basis were up 11.0% and ex not only gas inflation and FX but revenue recognition, the 11% would be 8.3%; Canada reported 2.4%, ex-gas FX and revenue recognition will be plus 5.5%; Other international reported 4.0%, ex those items plus 5.8%. So total company reported 8.8% ex gas FX and revenue recognition impact 7.5% plus. E-commerce 12 weeks reported 32.3% and again ex those items plus 34%, -- 26.2%.","In terms of Q1 sales metrics, first quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 4.9% worldwide and within the U.S. 5.2%. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impact sales. Gas price inflation benefited Q1 comps and revenue recognition benefited as well. Combined those three items added about 130 basis points, essentially the difference you see between the 8.8% reported and 7.5% I mentioned above, cannibalization weighting on the comp by approximately minus 70 basis points. Our average front end transaction or ticket was up 3.7% during Q1 and excluding the impacts from gas and FX and revenue recognition, the average ticket was up approximately 2.4%.","Next on the income statement is membership, we reported an increase of 9.5% or $66 million coming into the quarter of $758 million in the first quarter of this year compared to $692 million last year. FX had a negative effect of approximately $6.4 million. So the 9.5% increase would have been about 10.4% ex-FX. Reported membership revenue again was up 9.5. About half of that's related to the membership fee increases taken back in June of 2017. And as you all know, it takes about 23 months to get through the book part of the income statement that benefit.","Our renewal rates also rose in Q1. U.S. and Canada membership we made in Q1 end came in at 90.5%, that's up from 90.4% just 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end. And worldwide rate improved to 88%, also up a tenth of a percent, up from 87.9% at 12 weeks ago at Q4 end. In terms of number of members at first quarter end, Gold Star at Q1 end was $41.3 million that compares to 12 weeks earlier of $40.7 million; business primary 7.6% and both at quarter end and -- this first quarter end and year end; business add-ons stayed at 3.3%; all told what we started the fiscal year and we ended last fiscal year with $51.6 million members, we ended Q1 at $52.2 million.","Total cardholders at year end from last quarter was 94.3, and again at this first quarter end it was 95.4. We opened six new warehouses during the quarter. Also at first quarter end, paid executive memberships came in at a total at $19.7 million, which is an increase of $442,000 or $37,000 a week since 12 weeks earlier. That's one of the biggest weekly deltas. Part of it depends on when we do different activities to get members to upgrade into as new members sign up as well. So, you'll see that fluctuate but certainly a good showing in the quarter.","Related to the annual fee increases, again I mentioned earlier, we've now past the halfway point at last year's fourth quarter. The 23 month cycle, it takes to recognize the incremental benefit from the fee increase. The benefit will continue to diminish in each of the remaining three quarters infused 2, 3 and 4, very little in Q4 actually. And again, that's based on the deferred accounting which we use.","Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 50 basis points, coming in at 10.75% as compared to 11.25% a year earlier. Now excluding gas inflation and revenue recognition that minus 50 would have been a minus 26, and I'll start with my line items, if you want, comparing this minus 50 to the minus 26. If you just jot down two columns of numbers, the five lines; the first line is core merchandise; the second line ancillary businesses; the third line 2% reward on executive membership; the fourth line other; and then the fifth line of course total.","On a reported basis, the core merchandise year-over-year in Q1 was minus 43 basis points. Ex gas inflation and revenue recognition, the minus 43 would be minus 22. Ancillary businesses, which was a plus 5 reported; ex those items it would've been plus 11; 2% reward zero and a minus 2; other minus 12 and minus 13; and if you add up those two columns, you get to the minus 50 reported and then ex gas inflation, revenue recognition the minus 26.","Now again going to the core with minus 43 ex those items going to minus 22, that's again based on sales penetration of that as compared to the total company as well. If you look at just the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, what I call core on core, margins year over year were lower by 6 basis points. Subcategories within core gross margin year-over-year in Q1, both food and sundries and hard lines were up and soft lines and fresh foods were down. And then net of those four categories was a minus 6.","Ancillary and other businesses, as I mentioned reported plus 5; plus 11 ex gas in revenue recognition in the quarter; gas was up, e-com was up a little; businesses were up a little, pharmacy a couple of other things were down a little. But net of those all, they were 11 basis points ex those items. The other net fee $43 million pre-tax amount that I mentioned earlier related to the Citi\/Visa co-branded card. And we put it here, because it's part of the deal is things like the rewards that are paid out to the cardholders as well as bounties that are earned and revenues that are shared. So this impacts the revenue line of our company and the sales line and therefore it impacts the gross margin percentage.","So the $43 million, this relates to our Citi\/Visa co-branded credit card program. Over the past few months, we made the decision to expand our efforts to remind our members to redeem their outstanding rewards. By stepping up our reminders, we saw a step up in the redemptions relative to what we've experienced previously.","These are the rewards certificates that were sent out in February of 2018. The rewards program on the Citi\/Visa card is a calendar your program. So these are the rewards certificates are sent out in February of '18, for rewards earned on Citi\/Visa card transactions over calendar '17 and to expire at the end of this calendar year. The $43 million adjustment relates to two things, one to the thing I just explained. I described to the recent increase in these redemptions. And second, the additional breakage amounts now estimated on the rewards being earned and accrued on calendar year 2018 card transactions. These rewards will be sent to the Citi\/Visa card holders in February of 2019. So if you see in this line as basically adjustment to our estimate of breakage on rewards earned on purchases made prior to beginning of fiscal '19. Going forward, we're using this lower reward breakage assumption.","Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q1 over Q1 was lower or better by 23 basis points on a reported basis and flat or zero without gas inflation and revenue recognition. Again, came in at 10.13% this year on a reported basis compared to 10.36% last year. Again, I'll ask you to jot down two columns and five line items. The first column of course is reported and the second is ex those items. First line is operations, core operations. Q1, '19 reported was lower or better by 23 basis points and lower or better by 4 ex those items. Central -- lower or better, I'll use a plus 9.","Central, plus 4 and plus 2. Stock compensation, which is always the biggest impact seems to be in Q1, because that's what we do our annual grants for over 5,000 employees. Stock compensation minus 4 and minus 6 and then other is zero. So your total again reported some of those three line items to plus 25 basis points are lower year-over-year on a reported basis by 23 and the second column basically flat year-over-year on ex those items basis.","The core operations complete again was lower, this primary results in sales growth, offset in part by the U.S. wage increase to hourly employees that went into effect -- to most of our employees that went into effect on June 11th. The wage increase negatively impacted SG&A by approximately 8 basis points in Q1 year-over-year, and this will continue to impact the SG&A year-over-year comparisons over the next two quarters. I believe we did it effective June 11, '17 -- in a June 11, '18 go through the same time period a year later.","Our central expense was lower or better year-over-year by 4 on a reported basis, and then lower or better by 2 without those items. Within that IT spend in the quarter was flat as a percentage of sales. Stock compensation as I mentioned, the biggest impact typically is in the first quarter, so you'll see a little bit of a difference there. Next on the income statement is pre opening expense that was $5 million higher in this year's first quarter to come in at $22 million compared to 17 a year earlier. We had one more opening this year, but there is plenty of other things going on and not just opening new warehouses with everything from chicken plants to expansion of depots and fulfillment.","All told, reported operating income in Q1 came in at $949 million compared to $951 million in Q1 last year. Two other things I mentioned this report of course is that the $43 million related to the city rewards program, as well as the hourly wage increases. Those are certainly two things that have impacted the year-over-year comparison.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense. It was $1 million lower year-over-year coming in at $36 million compared to $37 million. And on the interest income and other, essentially flat year-over-year. Interest income within the numbers was actually $8 million better year-over-year, higher interest rates and a little higher invested cash balance, offset by FX items that amounted to about $9 million to the negative. The FX tends to fluctuate both up and down within prior quarters. In total, pretax income came in at $935 million compared to $936 million a year ago.","In terms of income tax rates, income taxes -- our reported tax rate in the first quarter was 15.9% compared to 30.4% in the first quarter of last year. This quarter's tax rate benefited from the lower federal rate related to tax law changes, as well as some favorable discrete adjustments. Notably, the $59 million tax benefit related to stock-based compensation, compared to $41 million year ago and a $27 million benefit related to the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act as I mentioned earlier before. For fiscal '19 based on our current estimates, as I mentioned each quarter, these of course are subject to change. We anticipate that our effective total company tax rate for fiscal '19 to be in the 26.5% to 27% range. This figure is a little more than a percentage point lower than what we had previously estimated, as I mentioned in our last quarterly conference call, but lower is good.","A few other items of note in terms of warehouse expansion, we've opened eight locations, including two relos, so a net of six in the first quarter. For all of '19, we expect to open 20 -- about 23 net new warehouses, as well as four relocations. The two we've opened plus two more planned for the rest of the year. Within the 23 net new, about three quarters of them are in the U.S. and about a quarter of them are international.","We're also under construction with our first Costco in China and Shanghai with the expected opening later in calendar 2019. As of first quarter end, total warehouse square footage stood at 111 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1, we've repurchased $34.5 million of stock 150,000 shares. I'll turn my attention to e-commerce. Overall, e-commerce sales increase continued at good levels. Both for the quarter and just last week, of course, we reported the four weeks of -- the calendar four weeks of November, which would include the first week of Q2. For the quarter, reported e-commerce came in at 32.3% up, ex FX and rev rec, they were up 26%. And as you saw last week, the numbers are a little higher than that, both for the four-week November period.","In fact, the good news is we've established all kinds of records for orders and sales during the Black Friday through Cyber Monday weekend as I'm sure many else have as well. The top growth categories in the quarter were grocery, consumer electronics, hardware, health and beauty aids and automotive. One highlight of our website refinement during the quarter was our redesign of the home categories. We feel that the refresh made departments like furniture, domestics and house wares easier to shop. With that change, we also expanded some of the product selection within the subcategories.","We've now passed our one year anniversary of the grocery launch last October. Same-day grocery delivery is now available to members within the 20 minute drive of 99% of our U.S. locations. Two-day grocery, which we do for our business center is available throughout the Continental United States. We continue to focus on providing great values on high-quality merchandise, and we had a few interesting new merchandise items online this quarter. A couple of examples of fresh white truffles, golf simulators, all types of high-end cosmetics and creams like La Mer. Pendleton in apparel in domestics, George Simonton Couture Cashmere coats, Wheels Up memberships for air travel and even a few Super Bowl packages.","And heart of the press, we went live online I think yesterday or last evening, but this morning with a online with newly complete but basically free line of Apple iMac products, both from MacBook Air to MacBook Pro to the iMac and to MacBook, and we're excited about that. And stay tuned for similar offerings in store that we\u2019re working out the logistics of that. We've also continue to improve our online and inline cross marketing initiatives. We continue to do that in addition to drawing attention to our online offerings via these digital communications, we're leveraging that to highlighting feature and warehouse items in hot buys in store and driving traffic. We believe that certainly some of our strength traffic has to do with that.","In terms of update on buy online and pickup in-store, we've expanded the selection, no new categories but put some additional assortment and testing pickup blockers in about 10 locations for this program. Overall, these efforts continue to reveal this positive impacting our business and again most importantly, not only online but in warehouse and probably the sales in both ways.","Quickly on tariffs, there is not a whole lot new to tell you there. The big news of course in the last week or so is the fact that the planned increase on many items from 10% to 25% tariff rates effective January 1st has been pushed out I believe 60 or 90 days. And so not whole lot new for a quarter earlier. There are some items that when the tariffs have been in the 10 plus percent range have been very little impact on the sales, some has been a little more negative impact. We've particularly done a good job and it's one of the senior merchants mentioned, this is what we do with regular price increases as well, cost increases, we figure out how to get to minimize it.","And we brought in additional containers of certain seasonal merchandise early before the January 1st deadline, and we will continue to keep you posted. Lastly, in terms of upcoming press releases, we will announce our December sales results for the five week ending Sunday, January 6th on January 9th after the market closes.","With that, I'll open up to questions. And I'll turn it back to you, Liz.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Within your core-on-core gross margin, it's been spending a little bit lower over the last couple of quarters. What's been driving that? Are you starting to feel the impact of your pretty rapid e-commerce sales and the margin dilution from that on your core-on-core gross margin? Then I have a follow-up.","Richard Galanti","There is two people in the room here, one senior merchant, that\u2019s really us. There has not been lot of change. I was just looking back, if I can -- the fourth quarter, I believe year-over-year, it was lower by two. I believe in one of the two previous quarters on a year-over-year quarterly basis is in the 4 to 6 range. So, it\u2019s really -- we don\u2019t really view it as much more than the things that we're doing to drive our business. We get pretty excited for how to drive sales and whether it's Buyers\u2019 Picks or Hot Buys or some of the promotional seasonal items, I think that's seen in our -- the strength of our business. The only thing that I pointed out in the past quarter or two is on the fresh side, we've seen little bit more margin pressure as there's been a little bit more retail competitive pressure out there, not only from supermarkets but Sam's as well but that's part of the business.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up question is on the expense side, recognizing that you've been investing in wages and investing some of the tax benefit that you got. But you have put up some of the best comps we've seen in a long time and expense leverage has been modest. So when can we start to see that improve?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind within these numbers, there's about 8 basis points related to specifically to that what I'll call that extra rate increase that we did in June post the tax at changes. On the IT side, we've got a heck of a lot going on. I think it still will bounce around a little bit, but having it being flat on a year-over-year basically and quarter we're starting to see that. Look, it's all sales related. There is really a lot of different things. We didn't go through all the activities we've got going on now, whether it's related to bringing into some of our depots, the returns activities, the fulfillment side with the success -- with a rapid roll out a year ago into our business centers of the two day and frankly with the success of e-commerce, including a lot of small ticket items or smaller ticket items that just the much higher penetration of bigger ticket items that we used to do be allow the small package fulfillment. We're making sure things get there on time even if it cost us a little more. So, I mean, there's lots -- I can go through a list, there's lots of little things. But I think we've got a lot of good things going on. And as long as we can keep sales going, you'll see that.","Michael Lasser","But just should we interpret that answer as, -- even if you continue this rate of sales growth, expense leverage should continue to be modest?","Richard Galanti","Well, we'll see. I mean, we never want to predict where it's going to go. Our first -- we are clearly a top line company. We clearly aren\u2019t going to do things to wages or to healthcare costs. Over the time people have always asked us how do we -- what are we doing to control healthcare costs. It's my first somewhat flip, but real answer is, expand more overseas. Healthcare costs as a percentage of sales in the U.S. are 20 to 60 basis points as a percent of sales higher than all other countries.","Our foreign pipeline, international pipeline is, it has expanded and I think you'll see that 70.30 or 75.25 U.S. versus international start to move with a little more international. So there is things that we do to ourselves based on when we do it. We've got a lot -- again, we got a lot of things going on with ancillary businesses, with expanding the whole fulfillment in risk and depot system.","I think I am beating around the bush because I think we can't really tell you where and when. We feel good about we're building to accommodate even more growth in e-commerce and on the delivery side. And we know that we'll see some of those costs associated with that come down as a percentage of those sales. But we're not going to tell you when it will take some time.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you, Richard. I wish you have a good holiday.","Richard Galanti","Last one, Michael. I mentioned earlier, the stock compensation. Stock compensation is not just to a few people of this company, it's over 5,000 employees. And in many cases from warehouse manager above and buying managers and above and certainly the senior people, it's 60% to 80% of compensation. Because of our annual grants that invest currently over five years are granted in October, which is Q1. The fact that our stock price has increased as well and acceleration related to 25, 30 and 35, that was 6 basis points of it. You're not going to see that thing forever. If you look back last couple of years, you'll see that typically in the first quarter and that will ease off in the next three quarters.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Simon Goodwin from Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Simon Goodwin","Richard, I missed some of the prepared remarks. So I didn't hear what the core-on-core merchant margin was. But my question is, if margins let's say came in a little lighter than what The Street was looking for, curious if you can talk about. Is the cost of business going up? Is it reinvestment? Is it investment as external factors? And then I know you don't like to comment on the reinvestment rate. But is that changed this quarter given how much of -- how good sales were and there's more dollars flowing in?","Richard Galanti","Well, in terms of -- we're not that scientific and smart about how we do it. We're merchants at heart. And when we see things work we go for it. As it relates to the core-on-core, year-over-year it was down 6 basis points. As I mentioned in the last couple of quarters, we've seen a little bit more competition on the fresh side, which is fine. We've got good fresh sales numbers, but we like others, our competitors are working in a little lower margin there and we're not going to let anybody take it away from us. But that's a small piece of that delta. There is a lot of other moving pieces to it. Part of it is related to the fulfillment side of it. We are encountering slightly smaller margins in some of that stuff as we roll it out very fast. But again, we don't really see -- in terms of are we investing more because we have it no, we invest more because whether we had or not, and we see these things working for us.","Simon Goodwin","And then just two quick ones. Can you tell us what the e-com penetration is, either the quarter or just e-com stands? And then the other piece is just cents per gallon or the gas margins, I don't know, but I'm sure you spoke about what they were in and of itself. But has the margins widened out?","Richard Galanti","Margins of gas have widened out. I mean everybody -- our sense is everybody is making more money out there. As they make more money, we make a little more money, but we sell a heck of a lot of gas. In the last -- I don't know what it was this quarter, but in the last couple of quarters, U.S. -- whereas overall U.S. gallon consumption is in the very low-single digits. We've been in the high single digits of gallon consumption, physical people coming in and filling up their tanks. And so, that's all good in that regard. What was the other piece of the question, on that e-commerce?","Simon Goodwin","The e-com benefit, yes.","Richard Galanti","I think it's just under 5%, 4.8% -- approximately 4.8, so somewhere between 4.5% and 5%, but I think 4.8%. But on that I think it was about 60 or 80 basis points impact to the comp, including revenue recognition.","Operator","We have the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","Chuk Grom","Richard, just on the other grosses again. I think you said overall down 50 ex rev rec and gas discount 26. Can you quantify with the actual rev rec impact was for 2Q, and how we should think about over the upcoming quarters?","Richard Galanti","I can\u2019t give it to you, I don\u2019t have it exactly. Revenue overall was down about half -- I will give you an extreme example though. Historically, what they call a curated travel package where we it put together, we have a commitment to the different components of that travel pack, it'd at the hotels or the cruise whatever. Historically, that was a brokerage fee, a brokerage commission. And I am making this up completely. But let\u2019s say there was $500 brokerage commission, you had no sales -- you had 500 in sales the brokerage commission and essentially no cost of sales. And so we will say that\u2019s a very high margin percentage. Now that was related to, and again I am making this up, a $5,000 cruise package or $5,500 crews package, you would have 5,500 in sales, 5,000 across of sales and above. Now, it's a very small piece of our business but that\u2019s -- for the year that $700 million of it of that revenue recognition. So, there is a lot\u2019s of moving parts within this thing.","Chuck Grom","We thought it maybe could be about 10 to 12 basis points, I don\u2019t know\u2026","Richard Galanti","How much, what's that?","Chuck Grom","Roughly 10 basis points in the quarter, so we thought that with\u2026","Richard Galanti","Yes, qualitatively, I\u2019m hearing little less than half of it, so 10-some, like it's a little less than half of 22.","Chuck Grom","And then just again here just on the model and there is 2017 tax impact that you had. Was that just a onetime item in the first quarter, or is that going to repeat? It doesn\u2019t sound right, doesn\u2019t sound it will based on your 26% to 27% tax rate for the year, but just wanted to\u2026","Richard Galanti","It was one-time. It relates to the tax act, but some of it relates to things that it started for us in fiscal 2019. And by the way, there is still some moving parts to the tax act. I mean, it's hundreds of pages. Some of things don\u2019t work completely outlined. There may be a little pluses and minuses. This was a little bit bigger than a little plus, which was good.","Chuck Grom","And then just with -- I think a year from now under the belt with cost of glossary and Instacart. I\u2019m just wondering, it doesn\u2019t seem like it based on how strong November was. Just wondering if you think you're losing any in-store traffic from somebody just replacing that trip with buying online, either though CG or Instacart?","Richard Galanti","I think the view is it's incremental. It\u2019s hard to say when the in-store frequencies are so strong. And I don\u2019t think we done a lot of pulling of members to see is this incremental or not. But we feel that we\u2019re seeing less than we originally thought, which wasn\u2019t lot to begin with in terms of does it take away from the frequency in the store. It can\u2019t add to it. But it has opened some new markets for us or some expanded markets. Anecdotally, I have plenty of friends that come up to me and tell me that how they love it in terms of doing more -- some of their incremental food shopping that way or making it more convenient to themselves. And we\u2019re finding the people that live further away are using it more, but these are all anecdotal nothing science related to my comments there.","Chuck Grom","And then just a follow up on Simon's question about the e-commerce margins, might have saying historically it's been a margin accretive category for you where it garners the higher margin than the store margins. I just want to make sure that that still in fact correct?","Richard Galanti","No, that's never been a higher margin. It\u2019s been a little lower margin. You've got competitive categories like lot of things which nominates the penetration and then there is cost of shipping. And so it's a little lower margin. It's a little lower margin and a lot lower SG&A, so it's a higher P&L if you will in terms of the earnings, recognizing that not every expense is allocated back to it.","Operator","The next question is from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","Did you see any hardest pressure from the port congestion, either having to pay to prioritize fly product in? And are you seeing any of that today as we go into '19?","Richard Galanti","Nothing more than usual this time of year idea, again anecdotally, I know that when we had very strong produce sales on the few items like watermelons around Labor Day. When you have to get an extra container somewhere fast not shipping across, I'm just talking about truck containers or the side trailers, something you paid$1500 for might cost $3500 for that last truck. But again, these were anecdotal stories I heard. My understanding is there was a little backup in China and Shanghai, but not a heck of a lot there. And plenty of part of that is every extra container goes out there merchants like Costco were filling them to bring in things in anticipation of certain tariffs going to 25% on January 1st. Can I interest you in some patio furniture?","John Heinbockel","And then broader on supply chain, right. So if you think about, I guess calendar '19. Is the chicken plant the only lumpy thing? So I think that\u2019s still slated for calendar '19. The opening of that -- can that -- will that actually, we'll actually be able to see that in the P&L. And is there anything else lumpy like that that might impact specifically supply chain in '19?","Richard Galanti","I think first of all the plan is by early summer, they'll start processing but not 100% capacity and that will take six or eight months to get to 100% capacity. So it's really into fiscal '20, or either mid fiscal '20 going forward, it's running smoothly and we're close to full capacity. There is a few other things that aren't as big and slightly less lumpy. Last year, we opened a commissary, bakery commissary in Canada. It's by no means at full capacity yet. We're adding items that we sell but doing some things that we didn't start off doing there.","Same thing we've had a meat plant in Tracy, California for 20 plus years. We opened a second meat plant in Morris, Illinois that will handle the Midwest and East Coast. It's by no means at full capacity yet. And so there's some lumpiness and that\u2019s -- both of those latter two things have been around -- the commissary has been around for over a year, maybe closer to two and the meat plant's been around for a year-ish. And so those are some of those, when I talked earlier about -- I think Michael Lasser was talking about what other things are challenges to SG&A. There's lots of little things like that, notably some additional -- the ramp up in getting up and running fulfillment both for e-commerce and those other two day deliveries. So we've got a lot of little things going on like that. The big lumpy is going to be, I mean just by sheer size of it, is the chicken plant, but that has more to do with this. There'll be some more preopening and there'll be some, perhaps a little more depreciation.","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, are you seeing any early signs of pickup in fresh inflation meat produce? It might be percolating a little bit. But have you seen that yet?","Richard Galanti","We haven't. One of the merchants here is shaking their head.","Operator","Next question is from Chris Horvers from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. So, first of all, on rev rec. So as we think about that gross margin pressure that you experienced in this quarter, is that something you expect for the rest of the year, essentially, there's no recapture or pressure all year because of the change in accounting? And then also on the top-line front, I know you mentioned that there was a benefit to this month on the top-line in November, but that has pressure in December and January. So over the year is the rev rec impact to the top-line neutral?","Richard Galanti","That latter question is related to income. Now rev rec will be for the year, I think in our September sales release, we talked about the fact that throughout '19 we estimate that this new standard will benefit sales by about 1%. So 1 point something billion dollars. Some other things have more margin percentage in fact. But and at the end of the day, it has no impact on the bottom-line.","Christopher Horvers","But -- understood. So you had a big benefit in this sort of November month in this quarter because of e-commerce, right? And that's rev rec? So you had a bigger benefit now. So it just mitigates throughout rest of the year essentially? Or goes the other way?","Richard Galanti","Relatively speaking, there's a bigger benefit at the end of Q1 and into December because of the holidays and the strength in e-commerce.","Christopher Horvers","Okay. And then the gross margin, I know it's up and down to the SG&A line, but the gross margin impact persists over here?","Richard Galanti","Yes, typically will be an 8 to 10 basis point headwind.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. And then, in terms of the e-commerce strength in the month of November, you got a lot of stuff on website, you're advertising it more. Were you more I guess aggressive with advertising or promotions because it was Black Friday or is this just a new normalized rate of like, \u201cHey this is what we're offering\u201d and sort of there's some sustainability to that growth that you saw in the month of November? ","Richard Galanti","They were the same number of ads or marketing pieces. We have more e-mails that you're sending to. We've done a better job over the years of collecting e-mails. There is better values. I think a year ago we talked about not only online but in-store, better values Hot Buys and Buyers\u2019 Picks that higher traffic and higher conversions. Those are all things -- some of that stuff is improving your site one-on-one recognizing that there are so many things we had done as well in years prior, and the values. I mean I think we've got the attention of the suppliers in many cases and they see how it\u2019s improved their business. Particularly in a way in some cases, those products are doing as well as our competitive brick and motor operators.","Christopher Horvers","Yes, I bought a snow blower and it was like 30% cheaper than when I could find at a big box store. So in November, that was my Black Friday gift. My last question -- and they delivered it to my garage. My last question is, what percentage of e-commerce are you shipping currently versus direct from vendor? And where do you think this goes over time? And like what sort of cost savings do you generate over time?","Richard Galanti","We are shipping about 50% ourselves and that tends to be the smaller size items and small pack sizes what have you, all the big stuff and all the white cliff stuff like white goods, big electronics, furniture, Italian furniture, those typically are done by third-parties. ","Christopher Horvers","Is that percentage getting up over time or just because the mix of small items goes up that's what drives it up? ","Richard Galanti","We'll have to see. I mean whatever is -- what we do whatever way is most economical. My guess is there are going to be some things that we're currently doing third-party that we will bring in-house as we get better and more confident in being able to do it. If you think even going back to some basic things like what we're doing with UPS with two days drive, it's not e-commerce but it\u2019s two day drive. What other things can we do in that box size? We are working with vendors as others I'm sure as well to figure out how to get certain products, how to minimize the freight costs by getting -- given our volumes and our predictability of certain items, how we can get closer in a more efficient way to ultimate delivery to a customer. ","Operator","And next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi. A couple questions. Just on tariffs. Can you maybe just elaborate a little on what your pricing philosophy will be with respect to tariffs? Meaning will you address price I guess increases if you need to on a SKU-by-SKU basis or are you looking at the whole box more broadly and trying to figure out how you can offset with a lower price increase across the box? ","Richard Galanti","It's SKU-by-SKU basis, recognizing it's a heck of a lot easier to do when you're always selling 3,800 SKUs in its entirety to start with. And again it\u2019s part of those price points. I mean I was talking to a merchant yesterday and they're giving examples of where on a $40 or $50 dollar item, that's up 20% or 15% -- 10% to 25%. They see no change in the unit volumes. And there's something -- and first of all if it's in the 10% range, I think we've done -- we feel we've done a good job of working with the supplier, what is the supplier willing to do and to try to minimize that or if there's competing suppliers, getting in more. So there's some items that even with a 10% increase we haven't had to change the price. Now maybe we aid into our margin a little, sometimes not at all. There are some items -- bigger ticket items, where you if you go from 500 to [6.25] at 25% or that may impact the unit volume of that stuff. In some cases, in anticipation of a 25% coming, we cut that quantity a little bit on some items. So it's all over the board, but overall as you might expect here we're going to be in the last increase to the lowest. But it's clearly not subsidizing it with other things. ","Karen Short","Okay. And then I guess just color -- a little more color on your comment on fresh getting more competitive with both conventional and Sam's. Can you just give a little more color on what you're seeing exactly? And then I guess the question -- bigger question I have is, I mean isn't there a possibility that Sam's continues to get more aggressive on other categories? I mean the pressure will likely spread. So I guess are you seeing any of that there or is it just limited to fresh? ","Richard Galanti","Look we're respectful competitors. We've been doing this for 35 years. We're not moving away. And we feel we're in a pretty strong area. I mean within fresh it\u2019s produce and protein and whatever comes our way we'll figure it out. And I\u2019m only -- part of challenge here in trying to be helpful to all of you guys is use of examples. It so happens that fresh right now year-over-year is down a little bit. There are times when it's been up. Right now it\u2019s notable. We still feel that we\u2019re getting more bank room from having Sam's close 63 units and certain incremental competition on certain things. And that's what we do, we compete. ","Karen Short","Okay. And then just last question, you comment on such thing -- pick up lockers in 10 location. Can you maybe just elaborate like how bigger the pick up lockers, is there -- are you kind looking to be expand that or broaden it? And what kind of SKU you would be able to fit in currently? ","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t think -- they won\u2019t fit a 60 inch television as an example. They are relatively small in looking I think in 10 locations. Keep in mind the items that we started with and we chose to do first of all were items where we\u2019ve every time -- and again I would have bought that from new Costco but I can\u2019t have it shipped to my office and I don't want to be left on our my doorstep and so I get home from work. And so we think we\u2019ve picked up a little incremental there. What we\u2019re finding is, is that many of these customers, they\u2019ve shifted, they bought it that way, first of all we have more availability of items because we offer a much broader selection that if you order online and pickup in store, you guys are really limited to jewelry items, some small electronics items and handbags. All buildings right away offer the service and show you that there is more out there but it looks as a test, we will figure it up.","What we\u2019re not looking to do anytime soon is full order online to pickup in store where groceries A, we don't have the room upfront; and B, we see -- we\u2019re probably little biased that we see that not every customer shows up when they order online. And separator between dryer, refrigerated and frozen and it\u2019s very costly, and we do have an alternative now with the Instacard engine.","Operator","We have the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. You may ask your question.","Edward Kelly","Rick, you mentioned the gas business and margins rising everywhere, we\u2019re seeing that at other companies. Just thoughts on the reason for that and the sustainability of that?","Richard Galanti","I think the reason is traditional retailer -- well all companies including us, we want to make money and what we have found is, is that as prices have come down our view is, our motive, if you will, our competitor pricing has gotten bigger. What we\u2019re saving -- you can just look at every week at GasBuddy.com but we do our own price studies. What we\u2019re saving customers relative to competitor stations nearby whether they are independents, or supermarkets or nationals, we\u2019re saving more today than we\u2019ve ever saved per gallon and we\u2019re making more than we\u2019ve ever made, partly because everybody else is making more, we\u2019re able to make a little more. ","How long does it last? I don\u2019t know. It does seem there is not a heck a lot of traction on gas prices going up. We have mentioned earlier you heard us from me before we want to make a little a lot of times. As it relates to gas I mean we have been enjoying for the last several quarters on a year-over-year basis, close to high single-digit gallon comps in the US population where it's just above flat, low single-digit, so we're definitely taking market share and we're enjoying able to do that while making a little more but not a lot more.","Edward Kelly","I just want to take a step back and ask you a question about EBIT growth. If you look at EBIT growth this quarter and adjust for one-time items like the charge on the breakage, adjusted wage investment, remove the MFI benefit. If you do all that it looks like EBIT grew somewhere in sort of like the 3.5% to 4% range. That was about the same as it was last quarter, but yet your comp is 7% to 8%, fuel is contributing. I'm just kind of curious as we take a step back here, help us understand how we read that I guess, why that number is not better and then how do we think about going forward because you might not be comping 7% to 8% forever. Does the kind of flow through improve from here?","Richard Galanti","First of all, two things, you mentioned the 3% to 4%. I think as you add those two items and that impact to pre-tax is 6% or 7%. But even that -- and I say the two items, the Citi\/Visa breakage as well as our payroll increase on top of everything we took because of the income tax. We knew some of that income tax was going to impact the pre-tax line in that way. The other thing you mentioned a couple of the other questions on there's lots of stuff going on here guys. And I think we're less worried about was gross margin 5 or 10 basis points different than it could have been. It could have been a lot better than what we did, we don't look at it that way, we look at what we can do to drive our business and we still want to make money. We still think long-term. We're creating a stronger and more loyal company. So I think that we're optimistic about what our future holds in that regard, I can't tell you -- I can't give you guidance of where it will go.","Edward Kelly","Thank you. ","Richard Galanti","And by the way, in addition to just the payroll hitting the tax, in our case rough numbers the first full year post the tax reform it's about -- on those pre-tax earnings is a little over 300 million pre-tax. So it's a little over 400 million -- sorry a little over 300 million tax benefit, that's a little over 400 million pre-tax. 120 million that went towards those wages. We view these monies as partly our members and we are doing what we do to drive our business. Certainly what we did to remind our members of the -- those that have the Citi Visa card to drive that business which is long-term positive through their revenue share when it's used outside, as we get more and more people who have it and more and more of impact at the top of wallet. So we think again all these things are driving. ","Clearly we in the first year of two-day delivery and fresh -- I'm sorry two day delivery and a big ramp-up in small package with the monies we're investing in fulfillment and the monies we're clearly delivering a package to our member even on the two-day delivery side at a more expensive price when we first started today, which is still more expensive than it will be tomorrow.","Operator","We have Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer, your line is open.","Rupesh Parikh ","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions, so first on the tax rate housekeeping question. The tax rate that you gave, the guidance, does that excludes the benefits that you saw in Q1?","Richard Galanti","Yes, it excludes to those usual things.","Rupesh Parikh ","Okay, great. And then on capital allocation perhaps the share buybacks again you guys are not -- you're not buying many shares back. I\u2019m just curious on the special dividend and just how you are thinking about capital allocation going forward?","Richard Galanti","Well first of all in terms of buying back stocks we do buy it regularly. We have a metrics that we look at, we adjust periodically as the stock goes up, we buy a little less each day, there\u2019s stock down by a little more. Even it was a small number for the quarter it was a little higher towards the end of the quarter and the beginning of the quarter. But that doesn't -- we will see what next quarter brings. As it relates to special dividends we have made no decision in that fourth special dividend, we've been asked time and time again because each of the three that we've done were spaced about 2.5, 2.25 years apart from each other. So we've been asked what happens in 2.25 years from May of '17 and we said we don't know, stay tuned and see. When we have done them, they've worked well. We still continue to generate a lot of cash in excess of our CapEx and in excess of roughly $1 billion annual dividend that is real historically about 13% a year. So it's certainly on the table but there's no promises of if and when and how much.","Rupesh Parikh ","Okay, great. Thank you","Richard Galanti","And why don't we take two more questions?","Operator","And next question is from Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Scot Ciccarelli","Hey, guys. It's Scot Ciccarelli. Richard, as you guys change your accrual for the rewards breakage, is that something that will be a notable item on a go-forward basis or is it relatively minor and kind of just lost in the rush?","Richard Galanti","It was relatively minor, keep in mind, you're talking about an in-reward that's in the $2 billion range a little. And if you look at it, this really effected -- we started doing this a few months ago, these reminders in a bigger way. And if you look at it, is sped up or increased the ones that were going to not be redeemed through that related to 2007 calendar purchases on that card. And then we had an net loyalty accrual for all purchases in '18, we were very lower to the accrual from -- prior to this from the previous year, but that's what we do. On an ongoing basis, I think the impact to the quarter relative to our old one was about a penny a share.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. Got it. ","Richard Galanti","It was like $6.5 million or $7 million pre-tax. So you could annualize that component on an annual basis.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. And then I want to clarify an answer to an earlier question I think it was from Chuck regarding the profitability of e-commerce. Can you help us -- I was also under the impression that e-commerce was a higher let's call it operating profit transaction for you, but the way you kind of phrased it, it sounds like it's a lower gross margin but maybe it's EBIT a positive contributor \u2026.?","Richard Galanti","It's a higher -- it's a more profitable operating margin. It has a little lower gross margin and a lot lower SG&A. Maybe a lot lower SG&A is more appropriate when you return lower SG&A because there are a few things that we don't allocate that certainly to it. But like when you buy something online return to warehouse, the warehouse gets charges for that. So we try to do not a complete full but it's charged towards IT expenses and things like that. And certainly on the direct buying and what have you. But at the end of the day we view it as more profitable than the bottom-line of our company as a whole.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it \u2026.","Richard Galanti","What?","Scot Ciccarelli","I'm sorry. And that is still whether it\u2019s being shipped by you or the third-party that you referenced to an earlier question?","Richard Galanti","It's all blended together. ","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Okay. Thank you. ","Richard Galanti","Okay. One last question. ","Operator","And for our last question, we have Scott Mishkin of Wolfe. Your line is open.","Scott Mishkin","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to make sure I understood the answer to the last question of the $43 million. It sounded like $7 million -- $6 million to $7 million of it is actually not one-time it's going to be kind of an ongoing. Did I get that right or I misunderstood? ","Richard Galanti","The $43 million relates to activities prior to the beginning of fiscal 2018. That's one-time in sense that goes back to anticipated redemptions higher than what had been previously reserved for both fourth calendar January 1st through December 31st, calendar '17 purchases transactions both in and outside of Costco on the Citi\/Visa card. From February of '18 when they were mailed out to everybody they've been redeemed. In the last few months, we upped the amount of times where we remind our members to redeem them. That increased the redemption. So based on what we had previously thought would be redeemed and not expire as of December 31st of this year we have the annual net piece. That's a little over a third of that 42 million. ","The other piece is all purchases later this year, those card members will receive a rewards certificate in February of '19, but every time a transaction is -- a reward reserved we accrue a little bit of the anticipated breakage or slippage in it. Well with our reminders we accrue a little less than that. So it's also all the purchases made from January 1, '18 through the end of August or September 2 whatever the year end was in fiscal '18, we up the accrual on that. In Q1 based on our lower breakage assumption and therefore higher accrual breakage, a lower breakage assumption, it will -- that was about just under $7 million pre-tax. That's the piece that will be ongoing. ","Scott Mishkin","Okay. So I think I got that. ","Richard Galanti","It was about $49 million-ish, almost $50 million. $43 million was one-time prior to Q1. ","Scott Mishkin","Perfect. And then my second question which is more strategic. I mean we're seeing a lot of companies and I think a couple of questions got to this, is that, as we go more and more and more omni-channel the flow through of our sales, the profitability just kind of comes in. How do you think about Costco? I mean Costco seem not to have this problem but maybe we are seeing a little bit of it as we go more omni-channel, just the profitability of the business gets a little bit -- it comes down a little bit. How do you think about that and how should we be thinking about that? ","Richard Galanti","Well I think that we were -- in my view we're fortunate that we're not impacted. If you look at traditional department stores which deliver stuff to your home and then you send 70% of it back, it's all free. That's a necessary part of their business. That's not necessarily profitable relative to the old way. Supermarkets, I don't think delivery -- to the extent you can even really take a customer or grow market share that will be incremental, maybe that the negative is offset by the positive of incremental sales. I think we've been fortunate. The way we've done it as it relates to e-commerce in general or even two-day delivery. We did go and spend hundreds, if not a $1 billion dollars around delivery. We\u2019re doing it actually as a partner of UPS limiting the things that we do and it seems to be working. ","Now we\u2019re still going to improve the cost of delivery on even that because there is some -- we want to be in entire Continental United States, there are some places that are farther away so we pay a little more on that. I think when we look at to the extent it\u2019s incremental, we've found -- I think we\u2019ve also benefited from things like if you look at white goods. Historically when we have limited white goods in store I think four fiscal years ago we did $50 million in US in white goods. Three years later in fiscal \u201818, we did $500 million, and then like 5.0 something in white goods, none of it\u2019s in store. We have displays in locations and display high end LG, Samsung, Whirlpool and like and most people want to deliver and actually the other one take it away. So all that white glove service. We have been fortunate in that regards. There is an example of because of what's happening in the world, if you look at -- you heard me mention apparel where brick-and-mortar apparel is generally down over the last few years that\u2019s given us an opening to buy certain things and historically we\u2019ve put in the quantities, 99% plus of our apparel is still in-store not online, we\u2019re testing these things online. It\u2019s a $7 million category that\u2019s grown compounded for four years in the high 8s. ","Furniture where we have an in store limited 20,000 to 30,000 feet of furniture for 8 to 12 weeks of the summer, after Memorial Day before Labor Day, we still do some of that in store but now as you\u2019re around online same with patio furniture which is there for 12 or so weeks January through part maybe early April and now geographically the locations that where people buy that stuff year around and have the ability to do that. So I think we\u2019ve been fortunate there are some things that given our item nature of our business has helped us in that regard and perhaps offset with that. Clearly it\u2019s got -- in the first couple of years, certainly these things cost us more. Building out the fulfillment centers, where part of that success online is getting people to open email to click on something and to buy something and where those will be a few years there, and I\u2019m sure if you figure that that but these strong sales will help that.

My name is Brittney and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 Earnings Call and February Sales Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Brittney. Good morning to everyone. I'll start by stating that our discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. That these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","So last night's press release reported our second quarter and first half fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 and 24 week periods ended February 14 as well as our monthly sales results for four week reporting month of February which ended this past Sunday, February 28. For the quarter, reported earnings came in at $1.24 a share compared to last year's second quarter earnings per share of $1.35.","Note that last year's earnings were positively impacted by two discreet income tax items that together benefited last year's second quarter earnings by $43 million or $0.10 a share, and that, excluding these two items, earnings for the second quarter last year would have been $1.25 a share. Among the factors that impacted our second quarter year-over-year earnings comparison, foreign exchange FX as compared to a year ago. During the quarter the foreign currencies where we operate continue to weaken versus the U.S. dollar in all countries but primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, resulting in our foreign earnings in the second quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $32 million or $0.07 a share and if exchange rates had been flat year-over-year.","Second item of comparison is our co-branded credit card transition in the U.S. that relates to that. As you know we're transitioning to a new co-branded credit card relationship in the U.S. this year as we wind down our current relationship. New co-branded credit card's signup stopped several months ago. The short-term negative earnings impact to the loss co-branded credit card signups was $18 million pre-tax or a $0.03 per share hit to the second quarter. Recall that the earnings impact was $15 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share last fiscal quarter, and it will continue to impact earnings in Q3 and a little even into the first month of Q4.","As of today, we expect to have the new co-branded Visa cards in the hands of our members in May with a go-live transition date in June. While I can't give you any specifics regarding the new card, contractually I can't do that yet. I do look forward to sharing more details with you at that time.","Third item, IT modernization. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact SG&A expense percentages especially as depreciation begins on the new systems that are now being placed into service. In the second quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis these costs impacted SG&A by about $10 million or an estimated 3 basis points \u2013 2 basis points without the gas deflation, which was about $ 0.01 a share.","There is a light at the end of this tunnel with the SG&A headwinds. Based on our current estimates we expect the year-over-year basis point impact to SG&A is likely to be just a couple of additional basis points in fiscal year 2017, and then flatten out, hopefully a little better than flattening out over the next couple of years after that.","Stock compensation expense was higher year-over-year, second quarter by $14 million or $0.02 a share. And lastly in terms of the year-over-year comparison LIFO. Last year in the second quarter we recorded a pre-tax LIFO credit of $4 million. This year in the second quarter, with deflation being a little more impactful than in the past couple months, we had a LIFO pre-tax credit of $15 million resulting in a year-over-year delta of $11 million or $0.02 a share.","Now turning to our second quarter sales. Reported sales were up 3% and our 12 week reported comp sales figure was up 1%. For the quarter, sales negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation to the tune of 80 basis points. And by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar by minus 340 basis points. Such that excluding gas deflation, the reported plus 3% U.S. comp for the second quarter would have been a plus 4%. The reported Canadian comp of a minus 7% in the second quarter would be a plus 10%, excluding both gas deflation and assuming flat FX rates year-over-year. And the report minus 3% international comp figure for the quarter, excluding gas and FX, would have been a plus 6%.","Total comps again reported 1% for the quarter, and excluding gas and FX would have been up 5. For the four-week month of February, which again ended this past Sunday, reported comps came in flat at 0%. That consisted of a plus 2% comp on a reported basis in the U.S., minus 2% reported in Canada and a minus 8% other international. As we discussed last month, the calendar shift of Super Bowl moved sales out of January reporting period into February. We estimated that this shift benefited our U.S. sales for the month of February by about 0.75% and the total company by about 0.5%.","Sales were negatively impacted by again gas deflation which started to head down again during the month. About 180 basis point negative impact to the number and also by weakening FX currency \u2013 foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar to the tune of 250 basis points. Excluding gas deflation in the U.S., the reported plus 2% U.S. comp for February would have been a plus 4%. Excluding gas deflation and FX, in February minus 2% comp in Canada would have been a plus 10%. And the reported minus 8% international comp would have been flat year-over-year ex gas and FX.","Total company comps reported, again zero for the month would have been a plus 4% excluding gas and FX. I might mention that the other international normalized number in other words ex gas and FX was zero. Mostly related to the time of the Chinese Lunar New Year holidays. We don't think that will be an issue after the timing of that.","Final comment on deflation. Beyond gasoline price deflation that we've always pointed out each month, we have seen a little additional deflation across many merchandise categories such that sales have been impacted a bit by \u2013 a little bit more in the past couple of months.","In terms of new openings. Our opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new units in Q1. Including two relos, so a net of 11 new locations in the first quarter. In Q2 we opened one new business center in Westminster, California. For all of fiscal 2016 we're still on a target to do 30 net new locations, 21 of which will be in the U.S., three in Canada, two in Japan, and one each in the U.K., Taiwan, Australia and Spain.","Also this morning I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal information, additional discussion, of course, on margins and SG&A, and a couple of other items of note.","Okay. In terms of the second quarter results, sales for the quarter were $27.57 billion up 3% from last year. On a reported comp basis, Q2 comps were up 1% for the quarter, up 5% ex gas and FX. For the quarter, our plus 1% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction decrease of minus 2.5% and an average shopping frequency increase of just over 3%.","Now in terms of the minus 2.5% average transaction decrease, again, taking FX and gas out of that number, that minus 2.5% would have been a positive number that would be just under plus 2%.","In terms of sales comparisons geographically, in the U.S., the Midwest, Texas and California regions were strongest. Internationally in Q2 in local currencies better performing countries were Mexico, Canada, Australia and Taiwan.","In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter \u2013 for the second quarter within food and sundries, overall flattish. Meat, deli and sundries were the leaders. Tobacco, negative in low-double digits as we continue to eliminate tobacco SKUs from various locations.","For hardlines, overall in the mid-single digit range. Departments with the strongest results were consumer electronics which was up in the low- to mid-teens, sporting goods, lawn and garden and tires. Within the low- to mid-single digit softlines, domestics and apparel were the standouts. And in fresh foods, comp sales were in the low-single digit range with produce showing the best results among the four main fresh foods categories.","Lastly, as we mentioned during the December and January sales calls, in the U.S., we're seeing deflation in the low-single digit range for foods, sundries and fresh foods, and now, again, a little bit more on the non-food side as well.","In terms of February, traffic was up a little over 3.5%, while the average transaction was down a little under 4%; about 3.75%. Again, gas, as I mentioned earlier, fell again a little more dramatically in February. The average sale price year-over-year in gas was down 21% for the month, which is a bigger decline year-over-year than we saw in the quarter overall.","In terms of geographic regions, again, for February, Texas, Southeast and the Midwest regions were strongest. And internationally in local currencies, Mexico and Canada were at the top.","From a merchandise category standpoint ex-FX, all categories, food, sundries, hardlines, softlines, fresh foods were in the mid-single digit range for February reporting period. Again, a little deflation impacting these. And it's a little deflation, but it's more than we have seen historically of recent history.","Moving down the line items of the income statement, membership fees, we came in for this fiscal year at $603 million, up 4% or $21 million from $582 million a year ago and up 2 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, that $21 million increase and 4% dollar increase, if you assumed flat FX, the $21 million would have been a $40 million increase, and the 4% increase ex FX would have been a 7% increase.","And in terms of membership, renewal rates remain strong; 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% rounded up in worldwide. Continuing increasing penetration in the Executive Member I think helps that. New membership sign ups in Q2 company-wide were up 4%. I will point out last month, the early part of February and into the second week of February, for 12 days we ran a new membership promotion on LivingSocial. Recall that we also ran a membership promotion with LivingSocial about 18 months ago. Like that one, it went well and we don't do it too often, and we don't want to get people used to it, but it was a good result.","In terms of new members at Q2 end, Gold Star members at Q2 end was 35.4 million up from 34.7 million at Q1 end 12 weeks earlier. Business primary remained at 7.2 million. Business add-ons remained at 3.5 million. So all total, at Q2 end, we were at 46.1 million versus 45.4 million at Q1 end. And total cardholders would be 84.0 million, up from 82.7 million.","As of the end of the second quarter, paid Executive Memberships totaled 16.6 million of our members, an increase of 214,000 over the 12-week month, or 18,000 a week increase in the quarter. As I've mentioned before, Executive Members are a little more than a third of membership base and two-thirds of our sales results.","In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue to be strong. Business in U.S. and Canada was at 94.5%, the same as it was a quarter ago. Gold Star was 89.7%, the same as a quarter ago. Total U.S. and Canada, 90.5%, same as a quarter ago. Worldwide at 87.7%, down a tick from 87.8% at Q1 end. And a little bit of rounding, and then as you know. In all new markets we generally have in the first year lower renewal rates, and that second year and the first year of renewals.","I've mentioned in the last couple months that in Canada when we did the credit card conversion, which is a little different than the one we're doing here, it was what was referred to as a de novo thing where everybody had to sign up for a new credit card and apply, and what have you. And so your renewal rates related to auto renewals, which by definition are high, it comes down a little. That will be anniversaried after next quarter. So, we saw a little tick down in Canada this quarter year-over-year as we had in the last couple quarters as well. There should be one more quarter of that, again, not terribly meaningful but we've been asked.","Going down the gross margin line, our gross margin in the second quarter was higher year-over-year on reported basis by 17 basis points. As always, we'll jot down four columns of numbers with six line items. The first two columns are Q1 2016 and Q1 2016. The columns would be reported, column one. Column two would be without gas deflation. Then we'd have Q2 2016, two columns reported and without gas deflation. Reading across, core merchandise in Q1 on a reported basis was up 24 basis points. Ex gas deflation was down 3 basis points year-over-year. For Q2 2016, reported was plus 5 basis points, and without deflation minus 3 basis points. Ancillary, plus 11 basis points and plus 4 basis points in the first quarter year-over-year. Plus 9 basis points and plus 7 basis points in Q2. 2% Reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 1 basis point. Q2, minus 1 basis points and zero. LIFO, plus 1 basis point and plus 1 basis point. And in Q2, plus 4 basis points and plus 4 basis points.","Other was minus seven and minus seven a year ago. And not an issue, zero and zero in Q2. Such that total reported year-over-year in Q1, we were up 26 basis points in gross margin. Without gas deflation, down 6 basis points. And in Q2 we were up 17 basis points and up 8 basis points ex gas deflation.","As you can see the core component of gross margin was higher by 5 basis points. 3 basis points excluding gas deflation in the quarter. Core gross margins, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were positive year-over-year in Q1 by 11 basis points, with food, sundries and hardlines showing higher year-over-year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. While softlines and fresh foods are a little lower year-over-year as a percent of sales. But again, the net of those four major categories as a percent of their own sales was up year-over-year in the quarter by 11 basis points.","Ancillary and other business gross margins were up 9 basis points, 7 basis points without gas. Both \u2013 in terms of ancillary businesses, our gas business, our food courts, our hearing aid centers, our tire shops and our mini labs all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percentage of their own sales. Again, Executive Membership not an issue without deflation, a zero impact year-over-year. And again, LIFO, a 4 basis point benefit to the gross margin year-over-year.","Moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentage in Q2 was higher or worse year-over-year by 34 basis points on a reported basis and higher or up by 27 basis points ex deflation. Let me again give you these tabular numbers and then I'll give you some text around those. Again, the four columns would be report Q1. The first two columns would be Q1 2016 year-over-year reported and without gas and deflation, and Q2 reported without gas. Those would be the four columns.","First line item, operations would be zero basis points in Q1 reported and plus 26 basis points without gas deflation, the plus meaning lower or better. In Q2 minus 22 basis points and minus 16 basis points. Central minus 8 basis points and minus 6 basis points in Q1. In Q2 minus 8 basis points and minus 7 basis points. Stock expense minus 12 basis points and minus 10 basis points in Q1. In Q2, minus 4 basis points and minus 4 basis points. And quarterly adjustments or unusual items, minus 8 basis points and minus 8 basis points in Q1. And no unusual items to point out, zero and zero in Q2. Such that in Q1 year-over-year on a reported basis, SG&A was a minus 28 basis points or higher by 28 basis points. And Q1 ex-gas it was better or lower by 2 basis points, so a plus 2 basis points. In Q2 it was minus 34 basis points as I mentioned and minus 27 basis points ex-gas deflation, so higher by 27 basis points.","Now core operations, again component, the minus 22 basis points. Again, minus 16 ex-gas, ex the impact of gas deflation. Of that minus 16 basis points, payroll was about minus 2 basis points. Benefits and workers comp were minus 8 basis points, with the remaining minus 6 basis points being a variety of items including bank fees, depreciation, and various other items. Again, I think a few of those things relate to a very slight change in sales increases. And a couple things just going 1 basis point in the wrong direction.","I'll also point out that within the benefits and workers comp, about \u2013 one thing that stood out, is just in January we had what was referred to as high cost claims for employee benefits, medical claims. Typically it averages over the last two years \u2013 this is U.S. \u2013 about $6 million or $7 million. A year ago it was a little lower than that, it was about $3.5 million. This year, it was about $13 million. So nothing unusual other than what we refer to as high cost claims, anything over $100,000 but it just spiked and that's a few basis points there. But again, that will come and go in both directions.","In terms of central expense, higher year-over-year in Q2 by 8 basis points, 7 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier, IT was 3 basis points of that or 2 basis points without gas deflation. In addition we had several one-time items which in total represented about $9 million. Again, we always have a few one-time things that go either way. We had three items that together totaled $9 million. But they are what they are and it didn't impact our SG&A. And lastly, the stock compensation expense was 4 basis points.","Now before I move on from SG&A, I do want to mention one additional expense headwind that is just starting. In March every three years, we review our pay scales and in fact our entire employee agreement. We always review top of scale and historically increase the top of scale every year in March where the roughly 60%, 65% of our employees that are at top of scale already. In addition, this year we're also changing the starting level or entry level hourly wages. This is the first change to the entry level wages in nine years. Since 2007 our entry level wage in U.S. and Canada was $11.50 or $12 an hour. Effective this month in the U.S. and Canada, we're increasing our starting wages from $11.50 and $12 to $13 and $13.50. So up a dollar and a half.","We estimate that this will cost us about $ 0.01 a share in Q3 year-over-year, and about $0.02 a share in each of the next three fiscal quarters. Again, it's part of what we do and as \u2013 there are a few warehouses that we've already started people at a higher level. Simply markets like Bay Area or some limited markets like that. At the end of the day it will be about the numbers that I mentioned in terms of the impact to our earnings.","Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense. Pretty much the same year-over-year. $9 million last year and $10 million this year. Last year we had no actual openings in the quarter but a lot of that relates to openings that are just getting ready to occur or just occurred, as well as one opening this year. All told, operating income in Q2 came in at $856 million, down 2% from a year ago's $877 million.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense in Q2 came in at $31 million. That's up $4 million from last year's $27 million. The increase is primarily due to interest on the $1 billion debt offering that was completed in Q3 last year related to our one-time special dividend that we did back in February a year ago.","Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million, coming in at $20 million last year and only $16 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was lower year-over-year by about $8 million, primarily a factor of less cash on hand this year as compared to a year earlier. This is a result again of two things. We had a $1.2 billion debt payoff last December as well as we used about $1 billion of our cash towards paying that $5 a share special dividend last February 27, a year ago. Overall pre-tax income was lower by 3% or $29 million in Q2, going from $870 million a year ago to $841 million.","In terms of income taxes, we got a little help there. Our company income tax rate this quarter came in right at 34%, up from a little over 30% a year ago in the quarter. The income tax line on this year's Q2 benefited from a few positive discrete items resulting in the 34% rate. Our normalized rate would have been a shade over 35%. While last year's income tax line benefited from, as I mentioned \u2013 we mentioned earlier, a $43 million benefit primarily relating to our $5 special cash dividend. Overall reported net income of $598 million last year in Q2 compares to $546 million of net income this year in Q2 on a reported basis.","All right. Run down of a few other items. A balance sheet is included in this morning's press release. A couple of things I always point out on this call. Depreciation and amortization for Q2 totaled $285 million for the quarter, and $556 million year-to-date. Our AP ratio, accounts payable as a percent of payables, last year in Q2 on a reported basis it was 97%, and this year 5 percentage points lower at 92%. That includes construction and other payables. So if you just looked at merchandise payables as a percent of inventories it would be 87% a year ago, and 4% lower or at 83% this year.","Last year being higher by 4% or 5% a year is actually the anomaly. A couple of factors, part of it was last year's West Coast port slowdowns. You had a lot less inventory a year ago on some big ticket low turn items like electronics. Just that one department was $120 million-plus of higher inventory and only a few million dollars of higher accounts payable. And then gas payables again was $20 million or $30 million to the wrong side of this AP calculation as we try to keep our tanks a little full, more full, when prices decline. So again, that's running the business, and nothing per se exceptional there.","In terms of average inventory per warehouse. Pretty much flat year-over-year coming in just $6,000 higher this year, an average inventory per warehouse of $12.761 million up from $12.755 million a year ago. Ex-FX year-over-year inventory levels per warehouse were up more than the $6,000, they were up $286,000 or up 2%. But that again, on a normalized basis I think is one of the smaller increases we've seen year-over-year in that.","Overall, inventory is in good shape. Not only in good shape, we just completed mid-year or our mid-year physical inventories and it's our best shrink results ever by 1 basis point plus. So again, I think it's indicative of running a clean shop there.","In terms of CapEx, in Q1 we spent $715 million, in Q2 we spent approximately $650 million more. We were still on track this year for fiscal 2016 CapEx to be in the range of $2.8 billion-plus. Maybe as high as $3 billion but $2.8 billion to $3 billion, that compares to $2.4 billion CapEx in fiscal 2015.","Next, Costco e-commerce, Costco online. We're now in six countries, having recently opened in Korea and Taiwan. We're also of course in the U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For Q2, sales and profits were up over last year. Our total sales were up 19% in the quarter, up 22% ex-FX and on a comp basis, up 18% reported and up 21% ex-FX. So continued good results in terms of growing our e-commerce efforts.","In terms of expansion, fiscal 2016 again we opened ahead of 11 units in Q1. One new unit in Q2. So 12 through midyear. We plan seven net openings in Q3, nine openings including two relos. So seven net. And in Q4 we are on task to do 11. So that would give us the 30 total for the fiscal year.","If you go back a year ago in fiscal 2015 we added 23 net new units on a base of what was then \u2013 beginning basis 653. So about 3.5% square footage growth. This year assuming we get to the 30, that will be about 4.5% square footage growth. Again the new locations by country if we do the 30, 21 in U.S., three in Canada, one in the U.K. and three into Asia. One in Taiwan and two in Japan. One more in Australia and one more in Spain.","At Q2 end, total square footage stood at 100.7 million square feet. Next in terms of stock buybacks in Q1 as I mentioned a quarter ago, we spent about $130 million buying 898,000 shares back, so an average price of just under $145 a share. In Q2 we spent $80 million on 531,000 shares, so an average price at just over $150 a share. During the first five weeks of the past quarter, very little stock was repurchased. In fact, of the total $80 million, $3 million of the $80 million was purchased in the first five weeks, and the remainder, the vast majority was in the last seven weeks. And that's purely a function of how we do it. We look at kind of a matrix pricing. As it goes up a little, we buy a little less, when it comes down a little, we buy a little more. As long as we feel comfortable about our runway, I think we'll continue do that.","In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share, so $1.60 annualized, which on an annual basis is about a $700 million number.","That's the quick and dirty of how Q2 went. I'll turn it back to Brittney now and be happy to answer any questions. Brittney?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Richard, I know you have this data; I don't know if you, how deeply you dig into it, but if you look at traffic in the U.S. by your different customer segments, and particularly your most loyal customers, right, so are the most loyal customers generally fresh food customers? Is that a good part of the basket? And do you think \u2013 is it possible that a little bit of the moderation in traffic is are you maxing out with your truly best customers? It's just kind of hard to grow frequency with that group?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I'd have to look into it. I don't know. My guess would be that our more frequent customers are bimodal. They're the ones that you mentioned that would \u2013 are shopping for frequency as families on a regular basis, and certainly food is a meaningful part of that. That's in my view, one of the two or three main factors that get people in the door on a more frequent basis. We also have small business members who are buying a lot of things, not necessarily fresh foods, but obviously some restaurants and community stores will buy some of that.","But in terms of maxing out, I've said it before, I continue to be surprised how many more Executive Members we're getting even up on the existing longer-tenured members. And so we \u2013 look, we've got to keep doing what we're doing in terms of being good merchants and constantly improving the value. And there's always saturation in everything you do. We're pretty good at figuring out ways to offset that. In the last year or two, certainly organics has helped. Not only bringing in arguably some newer perhaps younger members, but taking existing members who love Costco but there are certain things they didn't buy at Costco because they're an organic family. So I think we'll keep coming up with stuff. But I don't \u2013 I would bet that logically that makes a little sense, but I bet you it's not that big of a factor, that concern.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Do you think the \u2013 are your best customers, do you think they're shopping three, four times a month or more frequently than that?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry, who?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Your best customers, right, in terms of shopping frequency. Do you think they're up to three, four times a month or even more?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I'd say three or four times a month. I think you \u2013 look, you have some customers shopping twice a week. A core of are small business. I have a friend that shops six times a week. That's what he tells me, and I run into him a lot, and I scratch my head why. So, but no, jokes aside, arguably when there's a family that's getting to shop four times a week, are they on that curve of incremental frequency increases that would be \u2013 it's going to be harder and harder to do. But again, we're pretty good at figuring out a reason why they need to come back. And...","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And we're getting more \u2013 we feel good about the fact that in the last couple years, our average members' age which a half a dozen years ago was about a four-year \u2013 they were four years older than the U.S. population, that's now just under two. So it's going \u2013 that's going in the right direction for a lot of reasons. The fact that we keep adding some gas stations is driving frequency. I remember years ago, I've heard for 30 years, now that this thing is maxing out, fresh foods or gas stations, whatever it is, we keep figuring out new things. And I feel good about some of the things we're doing in a lot of the non-foods categories. Fresh foods never ceases to amaze me, and we'll keep going.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. And then just lastly, you talked about two of the categories were up in gross, two were down. So just maybe a little more color on the ones up versus down? How much \u2013 mix a factor. I guess I thought fresh food might, just because of deflation and a little bit of delayed pass through. I guess maybe you pass through that a little more quickly?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, we do that \u2013 by the way, one thing that Bob here reminded me of. Another issue in terms of a year-over-year comparison, or as some of you like to talk to the two-year stack. It was a year ago when gas fell dramatically in a big way and we had a couple of months there, we had a 5.5% frequency for a couple of months. So, I think some of it's the deflation that we're seeing now a little bit, but some of it's that year-over-year comparison when we had some pretty nice numbers there. Now I'm hopeful that we'll find out in the next couple months once we \u2013 not that we've anniversaried that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Joshua Siber on for Simeon. If gas prices stay low, do you expect to see traffic slow as that competitive advantage starts to diminish?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Again, in theory, it should be less of a factor helping sales because we're not on the news every night. We love it every year when GasBuddy comes out. Now, three or four years in a row since they started it they we're the lowest price nationally on average. I think we still get positive feedback from that. So yes, I mean at the end of the day, is it better when we had \u2013 is it better than when we had, gas was going down a buck year-over-year or over a couple months and it's on the news every night. Sure, that helps us a little more. But we still find people that are just signing up and can't believe our gas prices. Again, it's a net positive. It's less of a positive than it was in the first year, the second year and the third year.","Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And a follow up to John's question. I don't know if you have this in front of you, but would you be able to compare traffic and ticket growth across demographic groups?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I don't have \u2013 I know that our membership and marketing people looked at that and I've seen it, but I don't know if want to go that \u2013 I don't have it in front of me so I can't answer that question.","Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Last one for me, then. If you could talk about the dynamics between the credit card transition and a potential membership price increase in terms of timing? Well, there's no real dynamic. It looks like we're on task, as you know. Just last week, I believe, American Express and Citi announced the agreement to purchase the portfolio. And in which I believe we're on track to issue \u2013 Citi's on track to issue cards to the existing millions of members that have the current co-branded card in May with a transition date likely in early June. But, again, that could slow up a week or two, too, we'll see. And in terms of transition, there's not a lot contractually that we can do until then. And, of course, when the cardholders are being sent those cards by Citi, they'll be getting information from Citi. And I think that will start that process of making our members aware of what the new card brings to them and then we'll go from there.","Look, we're excited about getting it done. It is a big transition in a sense that there's millions of members that have the current card and they'll get the new card in the mail. We're excited about the value proposition to our members and we think it will be a net positive long term. Like anything, when we can save money, we want to give most of it to our members, and this will be like that, as well. We'll get a little benefit from it. As it relates to the fee increase, we really haven't made any decisions which would be consistent with the six times we did it in the past. History has shown that if you just dot it out chronologically, it's about e five to six years. The last time we did it was in January of 2012. So five years would be January of 2017 and six years would be a year later.","I can only tell you that, logic would dictate we certainly wouldn't do anything during the transition. We've got enough going on this year, mid-year when we're doing this credit card transition. And so all those align to a possible answer. At the end of the day, I don't know when we'll do it. I can tell you that we feel as comfortable today as ever about the loyalty of our members and we feel as comfortable as ever today that we feel that we've improved the value on that membership way more than the likely increases that you've seen in the past. So stay tuned.","Joshua M. Siber - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks, Richard.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yep.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Good morning. So I want to follow up on the potential membership fee increases. While last time you raised the Executive Membership price in addition to Gold Star, but I believe \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. That was the first time you had ever done it. So can you walk us through how you thought about that last time? And maybe reflect on how \u2013 what that could possibly mean for the next potential increase?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think the bigger issue is for about I think it's 10 or 12 or so years we had the Executive Membership out there. The Executive Membership from its inception was $100. And our view at the time was let's build it. And in theory every time \u2013 if you think about it when we originally did the Exec, I think the Gold Star was $45. And so there was a $55 delta if you will. And $55 assuming a 2% reward break-even if you will between do I stay a regular member, become an executive was $27. An incremental $2,750 of annual purchases. And as the $45 went to $50 and to $55 that delta became less, so in theory another bucket of \u2013 I think it was 2 million-plus million additional members that fell into that bucket of being above break-even than below break-even. And so we wanted to grow it. As we decided to raise it almost five years ago, four-plus years ago, not only from $50 to $55 but the $100 to $110, I think felt that we've gotten a lot of that benefit. And certainly there's a lot more benefit incrementally than $10 and so we felt comfortable doing that.","That's how we got there. How we get to next one, stay tuned.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then just reflecting back on the traffic I think, ex the Super Bowl, still three plus traffic comp. Do you think that much has changed in terms of the behavior of the consumer within the box in terms of maybe are you seeing it in different mix, buying less discretionary items, less sort of trade up within the category or any commentary there that you can talk about the consumer and how they're behaving in the store.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, in terms of discretionary, some of our stronger categories are not foods. And so that flies in the face of that concern. Did we see a little bit of \u2013 a little less strong numbers in some of those higher ticket categories in parts of Texas or Canada or \u2013 well, Canada was strong notwithstanding that. Or I guess North Dakota (41:04) I don't know about North Dakota. I know Texas it was a little different even though Texas overall was fine. I know that when I talked to our head of International, because of the strong dollar they saw a little bit of \u2013 a little weakening of that strength in the bigger ticket discretionary items. But overall we've had our best percentage dollar increases in electronics and statistically in TVs the last couple of months in a few years.","Christopher Michael Horvers - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning, thank you. My question was around membership as well. You obviously have a good retention rate and then presumably in existing clubs you have members that sign up to help fill the gap. I'm just curious if you can give us some metrics around comp membership growth, how that looks in the U.S. and then how that looks on international?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, first of all, any new market even when we went into New Orleans where we had been in Louisiana before a couple years ago. You're going to see a year hence when you have your first class of renewals, it's going be a number quite a bit lower than our company average. I think in the U.S. we typically see numbers in that first full year in a new market \u2013 and there aren't that many new markets anymore, but when we do, something in the low 70%s, perhaps.","Overseas when we first opened in Korea, Taiwan and Japan and as we've opened new units in new geographic markets in those countries, we might see in the first year our renewal rates in the high 50%s low 60%s and it grows from there. So our renewal rates \u2013 and that's why you see that we separate U.S. and Canada which is the most mature. That number is a little higher than the worldwide number for that very reason.","We always see a higher renewal rate among the Executive Members. They get it. They're spending \u2013 they're investing another $55 on top of the main $55 on that upgrade because they get it and they get the value of it. And we think that works, reward programs works. Co-branded credit card rewards works. Fresh food and gas works, all those things help.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","So, looking in aggregate, mature clubs and new markets, is the Company actually experiencing a comp store membership growth?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes. I'm sorry. And most of our sign-ups are comp sign-ups, so the answer is yes. I mean this is a rounded number here. But when asked, hey, if you have a 90% or 91%, well we'll use 90% for this example. If you have a 90% renewal rate and you had 100 members, what do you have a year hence? Well you have about 101 or 102. You lose 10 and you gain 11 or 12. That's kind of how it's been. And that's, and I'm shooting from the hip with this one, but that's pretty consistent with my assumption of if overall new member sign-ups are in the 4% range this past quarter.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And you mentioned the Living Social campaign was good. Can you give us a little color around how many and how many were millennials?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","No. Millennials were \u2013 well, not in terms of the number. We were pleased with our results based on our expectations of it. But, again, we don't want to get people comfortable waiting for that kind of value proposition to sign up. And so that's why we waited 18 months. And as it relates to millennials, I know I don't have the chart in front of me, but I know the chart that our head of membership marketing shared at the budget meeting. Yes, it over-indexes the other way towards younger people relative to our existing base, which is what you'd expect.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","And then my last question for you on the LIFO credit based on what you know today about deflation storewide, are you expecting additional LIFO credits as we get into the back half of the year?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","If it were today, I'd say yes. But you never know. Keep in mind when we have a LIFO credit, your markup is probably impacted a little the other way. When you have a LIFO charge, it's because there's inflation. You've raised your prices a little bit. Sometimes there's a little bit of a gap there. So it's part of margin. But yes, I think all things we see today, it would be a LIFO credit, a little bit of that extra LIFO credit.","Daniel Thomas Binder - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. On the wage increases, is the increase that you are giving this year consistent with what you've done in the past? And when you've done this in the past, have you noticed any change in your sales trajectory? So employee satisfaction goes up and that leads to a better membership experience or it coincides with broader wage inflation and some people have more money to spend and they spend it at the warehouses?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, well, somebody once said it's like chicken soup, it can't hurt. I think at the end of the day, at top of the scale we've done every year for as long as I can remember. When you've got somebody that's reached top of scale, they want to know what they're going to get a year hence. And we've always erred to the high side on that. I think over the last three years, top of scale in the U.S. is in the $23 range, $22.50 or something just top of scale. And so if you \u2013 and I think it was a $0.50 or $0.60 increase, so let's say $0.55 on $23.00 would be about 2.5%, a little under 2.5% increase. I believe the current increases are similar to that kind of percentage.","What we haven't done every year is bottom of scale. We like to be \u2013 and by the way, I want to also say is that the amount of cumulative hours it takes for somebody to get from bottom of scale to top of scale on a full- time basis, not that people will always start at full-time, they don't. But on a full-time basis it takes about four-and-a-half years which is very, very short period of time. So our employees get it. But we think this will help, and it's important to do. We want to be the premium at all levels. We're a huge premium at the top of scale. That's as others raise their rates at the bottom. And frankly in some markets, this is a physically challenging job. You're on your feet, you're lifting cases, you're pushing carts at these entry level jobs. And so we thought it was time to do it. So that is incremental. And that's when I mentioned earlier on the call that the $0.01 a share in Q3, thank you. And the $0.02 a share in each of the next three quarters because there are four quarters, that's that incremental piece that I'm talking about. Now I would like to think that we're not going to have less shrink or employee shrink because of it, or they're going to be better service providers to our members. I think it reinforces what they already feel. And that's what we're all about.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","And then my second question is on the competitive landscape. Traffickers remain good on a multiyear basis, but a little bit more volatile just on a one-year basis. Are you seeing any signs that you are having more interference from competition? It certainly doesn't look like it from some of your club peers, but maybe some of your online players are peeling off, some members, or peeling off some trips from your member base.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I don't think so. I mean again, on the margin, are there a few? I'm sure there's somebody that made one less trip to Costco because they bought something online or somewhere else. But I think we're still doing a pretty good job of getting them in the door particularly with fresh foods, with gas for the Executive Member with a quality co-brand offer in terms of rewards. So all those things help. I think we got, again \u2013 look, online is taking a piece. And some of those pieces, we're not going take. We're not going take the single unit items, some small-value food and sundry things that are going to be delivered to your door by 7 in the morning if you ordered six hours earlier. That's not us. We can't do that at 10% and 11% margins. We're taking little pieces of other things. Again, we still feel pretty good about what's going on.","Michael Louis Lasser - UBS Securities LLC","Awesome. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to go back, and this may be a follow-up to some of the earlier questions. But if the U.S. comps ex-gas in January and February, so my numbers \u2013 you had a 1% and a 4%. And you had mentioned before there was some shift between those two months, just given weather and then more importantly, the timing of the Super Bowl. But I guess the question I have, Richard, if you look at those months and then maybe take them in total, is that tracking \u2013 are sales in the U.S. tracking where you'd expect them to be and if not, is there something we can point to explain why?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, look. Like a teenager, we always want more. I think when we look at the detail, deflation is probably the biggest factor. And that gives us comfort that fundamentally there's not been a lot of change in our view. We still, it bothers us that it tracked a little differently. Again, that just makes us look at everything, what else can we do? And we've got a lot of good things going on out there. So do we like it a little better? Sure.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And on the deflation point, you probably gave these numbers already, but was deflation a more significant factor here in the first two months of 2016 than it had been say in the second half or latter part of 2015?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Again, there's different ways to measure deflation. The answer's yes, first of all. But there's different ways to measure deflation. If I look at a first, just from a LIFO index which is U.S. inventories. If everything started at a cost \u2013 everything that we had in our warehouse had a cost of 100.00, that was the baseline, at the end of Q1, so in late November, that LIFO index was 99.49. So a 0.5% lower. On average, that's that inventory LIFO calculation. In the last eight weeks, the 99.5 has gone to 99.06, so down 44 more basis points. So yes, that continues. So that's where I got the \u2013 it's a little lower. We're seeing a little bit more deflation. And particularly we're seeing it in some of those non-food categories. When I look at the 85% plus of our goods that go through our depot operations, again, this is just one parameter.","The number of pounds being shipped through with a dollar value, that dollar value is down a little over a 1% year-over-year. Now year-over-year, not from the beginning of this fiscal year. So again, that would indicate to me again we're seeing a little bit more deflation. I can give you crazy numbers on given items. On a year-over-year basis, when you look down, just candy. M&Ms down 10% year-over-year. American single slices of cheese down 15%. Bacon down 20%, so. But there's also some inflationary items.","But, overall, I think the LIFO index and that depot calculation, although it's not a perfect calculation, would indicate that we're seeing a little bit more deflation than we had overall. And particularly on the nonfood side you're seeing it. I think I mentioned a quarter or two ago when asked about that, with oil prices coming down, what about some nonfood items like plastic bags and things that require a lot of petroleum based products. And the answer I got back, and I shared with everybody, was yes you're seeing it but you've got to ask for it more frequently and more strongly. And even then it took a little longer because sometimes you've got vendors that have committed out several months, if not a year, on raw material prices. And we're going work with them. We're going to do what we can, but we're not going to create hurt. And so again, we're starting to see a little bit of that. But that's retail.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. That is helpful. Then the second question I had just with respect to the forthcoming shift in credit card and I know it is early but is there anything you are watching as some type of leading indicator as to how your members may or may not react to this shift?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Look, you've got 11 million or so members that have the co-brand card. You've got however many, high 20 million of member households in the U.S. We've had our share of letters both ways. Good. I'm glad you're changing, I never liked whoever. And then you've got those that say how dare you change, I got it for this reason, and I love my card, my existing card. So aside from that, we feel comfortable or we wouldn't have done it. We recognize that \u2013 we are looking to spend afterwards. I think with the reward proposition, with the \u2013 any possible improvement in merchant fee to us, with the fact that the new card will be accepted more places. There's a lot of reasons why it should be a positive. We have to get there and see.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Richard. You spoke about the incremental labor costs that are forthcoming with the $0.01 hit in Q3 and $0.02 thereafter over the next 12 months. But can you just dig a little bit more into the expense deleverage from the second quarter? Certainly as you mentioned, there was a little bit lighter sales volume so perhaps that had an impact. But how should we think about the results in 2Q and the outlook on payroll and benefits and operations central, et cetera?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think, first of all, sales drive leverage. And I remember years ago, when we were always asked the question, what comp sales number do you need to get any leverage at all, or to be consistent? And our guesstimate at the time \u2013 this has been years ago, was something in the 4% or 5% range an underlying comp. But my stronger and more confident proportionate response was, whatever other companies do to be able to better leverage if sales showed a little weakness, we're not going be as good, because we're not going to do some things. We are going to still clean the bathrooms every hour, and we are still going to make sure all the carts are inside, and not sitting out there, and we are not going to cut labor. In fact, we'll enhance labor. We've done that at times at the front end to drive more business.","So I think again the bottom of the scale increase that's easy, that's quantifiable. A few of the moves lined up on a few items, I mentioned the high cost claims was 3 basis points or 4 basis points. I mentioned there were three other items that usually two of them go one way, and one go the other way. And so it's a couple million, or a $0.0025 or $0.005 impact to the quarter. This time it was all in one direction. And so you're always going always going have that. But I guess I too get a little more defensive when we miss the number. Some of it was we could have done a little better job. And so directionally we're going to try to do a better job.","We're going to hope the moons (57:30) line up two to one to the positive, not three to zero the other way. And we know that we're getting a little less hit from IT modernization a year or two in. Other than that, that's what we do for a living. I think the other thing is to drive more business, and we're pretty good at that.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Fair enough.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","By the way, then the credit card. You've heard it before, I've said it before. Whatever this additional bucket of potential money is, we're going to give most of it to the customer in the form of a co-brand offering. But we're going to keep a little of it, and that helps merchant fees. But that's not going to start until the summer, and we'll go from there. So that should help us a little. We've got our fingers crossed.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I appreciate that color. Certainly we will take a look at the 10-Q when that is out to see some of the margin detail geographically. But could you maybe just give us a little bit of preview of any changes year-over-year from a U.S. or Canada or international standpoint? Maybe you can just speak to some of the performances ongoing in those particular markets?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","No, I think we'll have to wait until the quarter is out. The only thing that you've seen in the past historically is gas continues to be strong, but on a year-over-year basis, there's not a big difference. And gas is a big thing to the U.S. I think you've seen a couple of quarters in the 10-Q, in the last couple of \u2013 two or three quarters where the biggest improvement year-over-year on that, in the segment analysis of operating income as a percent of sales, you had \u2013 the most improved was the U.S. column, which is one of the lower columns. And that \u2013 and we've mentioned as part of that is attributed to gas. But I know in Q2, there was not a big, it was still good, but it was also still, it was very good a year ago. So other than that, I can't really talk to you about until it comes out.","Paul E. Trussell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Lastly from me and very quickly on e-commerce, you continue to have very solid growth, up I think it was 19% this quarter, 22% ex-FX. Can you just speak to some of the categories really driving that strength? Is there any expansion of assortment that we've seen online of late? And just a quick update on the Google and Instacart partnerships?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, we have over the last couple of years expanded some of the categories in what we'll call velocity categories; some sundries items, some limited non-perishable food items, some apparel items, socks and underwear, just speaking of things like that; health and beauty aids. So yeah, that's a little of it, but those are small pieces relative to if you can drive sales in furniture and exercise equipment and electronics. So those things are helping us as well. I think it's a lot of the things we've done. Some out there would argue it's about time. But we're getting to it. And we're driving \u2013 we're starting to do a few new things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, Richard. How's the growth in trips to the pump changed as gas prices have dropped here around $2? Has that been, have you seen a noticeable change there? And remind us what percentage of those fill-up trips correspond with a visit inside the club?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, for every 100 people that pump gas during the hours that we're open in the warehouse, because we open a couple hours earlier than the warehouse opens at the gas pump and close an hour later, it's in the low-50%s. And that's improved a little from 50% and 49%, but it's in the low-50%s. What was the other part of the question? I'm sorry.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","I mean, have you seen the growth in trips moderate as gas prices have fallen? I think \u2013 whether you mentioned that by comp gallon growth or what have you.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes. Well, what we see is when it really spiked a year and a quarter ago, we saw a spike there as well \u2013 well in terms of gallon-age comps. It's still positive and it still beats the U.S. averages out there, but it's more muted than when you have those big deltas.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's fair. That makes sense. And then just on the organic...","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","By the way, that means we're retaining it.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, no, understood. And then just on the organics, can you remind us where your penetration is at this point, what the pace of growth has been and where you think you can take that? Do you have more room to continue to improve the penetration of organics?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we're about $4 billion, which was I think in the last two years, it was up 30%-ish. And we're on task, I think our goal this year to have a double-digit number that has a two in front of it, and we feel good about it. We are I think doing as good a job as anybody in terms of sourcing. And part of the challenge is availability. And the industry is growing, needless to say. There are more farmers and more poultry producers and more beef producers that are committing more to this. And we're certainly out there literally in the fields here and abroad getting these growers and processors to do more. So, I think it still has some good opportunities there.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then last question just on D&A was up about 9% year-over-year in the quarter. Is that a pace that you are comfortable with kind of going forward? Is that going to accelerate at all as some of these investments come in or I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should be thinking about the growth in D&A going forward?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It's partly going up because of IT modernization and because we're opening 30 units instead of 23. And, although this 30, 21 or so are in the U.S. which is a little different than I would have guessed two years ago what it would be by now. So I would say that it will \u2013 for a couple years here it has kicked up. We got at least one more year where it will kick up because of IT modernization, this year or next. And then it probably kicks up a little bit because of just a little bit more expansion and a little bit more expensive expansion.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So does that the number, if D&A \u2013 if sales are growing X, does D&A grow at X plus two or three? I'd have to look at it, but it's probably as good a guess as anybody. I look at what it's done historically and probably it grows a little faster than that the next couple years \u2013 couple or three years percentage-wise","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, Richard. The average transaction increase was impressive at that plus 2% range. Do you expect that that will be a dynamic that will continue and within consumer electronics, what are the major pluses there given that it had such nice performance? Richard, as we do model the next year, what is the magnitude of deflation in terms of the impacts to comps? Is it in the 100 basis point range? And just I think you mentioned several different categories but is there an overall take on which categories it is applying to most?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, starting with last question first. Again, I think the difference now is that we're seeing a little bit more deflation on some of the non-food items, particularly like, for example, plastic bags and garbage bags and things like that that require petroleum-based products.","I still think again, you get the sound bites of the things that are down 10% and 20% but overall, if deflation as measured by our LIFO indexes are down, have been down 0.25% a year, and then last year maybe it was more than that. This year it seems like it's a little more. It's less than 1%. Maybe it's 0.5% to 1% instead of a 0.25% to 0.5%. But I'm guessing there. Then in terms of electronics, I think a couple things. I think arguably if we have a higher number that probably helps. We certainly over-indexed on bigger TVs. I know that during the four weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's; Thanksgiving and Christmas we had outsized TV sales dollars in talking to every major supplier that we buy from relative to everybody else, online and offline, and I think part of that was is that over-indexing to the 60-inch and 80-inch TVs. But we're seeing strength in phones. TVs is the thing that drives it. Cameras are better. But then cameras are better because they were weaker the last couple years.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","And, Richard, just to remind us, as a percentage of the total what is consumer electronics?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I have it in front of me. But I think Department 24, it's four or five. Four plus.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","With the...","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","And, Richard...","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","With TVs would probably 40%-plus of that.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And Richard, as you think about Costco for the long-term just for the five-year story of Costco, we know that you don't have the buy online and pick up in store, the BOPiS, so what are customers asking for as you really try to execute to customer desires? Is there anything on the delivery speed front and mobile that you would highlight as where you are focusing efforts on in terms of your human capital and strategic priorities as you look to bricks and clicks over the long-term?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","One of the challenges we have with picking up at the store is, we've got an average location that's doing $175 million, $180 million which means we've got a bunch of locations that are doing $200 million to $300 million and several that are doing more than that. We don't want somebody to come by necessarily and pick it up. Maybe that would change if we were having minus 3% comps in our lives. So we want to do everything possible to get them in the store and not just come and pick something up. So I don't see that as being a strategic focus of ours, at least in the near term.","We also \u2013 part of the thing of trying to get people in the store with treasure hunt items, with fresh foods, with gas. So we'll keep driving that. As we've done, our relationship with like the in six markets with Google Shopping and I think 16 markets with Instacart, there are people that want things delivered to them, and we're selling them. We're still selling it, but we're doing it that way. And so I think that's what we'll continue to do. We are getting better.","And again, some out there would say we've gone from an F to a C or an F to a D. Some would say we've gone to a B plus. We'd like to think of ourselves as we still have some things to do, but we've improved our mobile apps. We've gotten a little smarter about how we do it. We know that when you come in store, you're going buy a lot more than when you shop online in general, and recognizing our average online transaction is actually higher than our in-store visit. But that's because we started with just big ticket items. It's just recently we've put on some other smaller ticket items.","But we know that compared to let's say, an Instacart or a Google experience, the in-store visit is two-and-a-half to three times if not a little more than that. Now what we're finding is that that customer comes in a little less frequency, does the online several times, and then another, too, is an aggregate improvement in their comp. So that works. But we're still taking it slowly in terms of \u2013 I don't see us doing pickup at store at least in the near \u2013 in the next year or two, because we've got enough traffic there. We're trying figure out how to keep driving that.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Richard, you have been experiencing such robust traffic and healthy fundamentals. What is your take on the health of the consumer because there seems to be different factors going on at different income levels and at the same time, there is definitely stock market volatility? And a related question is if there is something that keeps you up at night for the next year, what would you highlight as risk factors as you evaluate them and think about them internally?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think one of the things I read, first of all, first and foremost, when we do our competitive price shops, we feel as good if not better than ever. When we look at our renewal rates and our customer loyalty, we feel as good as ever. When we look at our employee loyalty and our turnover rates, we feel as good if not better than ever. We certainly like to read those nice things that everybody says about us. And I think it reinforces, and we're doing it because we do it and we then reap the benefit of it.","So I think from that perspective, now at the same token, my favorite negative word or negative phrase out there, we talked about the volatility and the choppiness. There's a lot of what somebody referred to, not me, but toxic anxiety out there. The world is a little different. And this dollar strength doesn't help everything. And even the U.S. economy, while good, there's not a big engine driving it necessarily. So there is a lot going on out there. I think I'm comforted by our consistency even if it's come down a little bit in the last couple months. And I can explain some of that with the strength frequency a year ago. But look we'd still like an extra 0.5 point or 1 point there.","In terms of what keeps me up at night, what do we as a company or what does Craig, our CEO, get, and what do Bob and I and Jeff ask about? You know a lot of it centers around dot com and what are you going to do. And we try to not avoid it or be arrogant about it but also recognize we try not to freak out about it. So I think in my older age, I lose sleep for age-related issues not the company-related issues. I really feel pretty good fundamentally about our company and what we've got going on, what we're doing in terms of global sourcing, what we're doing in terms of the strength of our current signature brand. And things could change, but we're \u2013 and we'll keep trying do a few things on the Internet more, but we're going to take it steady.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Are you still selling tons of diamonds? Have your diamond luxury sales been really good?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes. I mean, I know in fiscal 2015 they were up \u2013 percentage wise up like 150 plus thousand karats which is 15% or so. Yeah.","Oliver Chen - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you. Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Operator","Meredith? Your line is open, you may be on mute?","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much and good afternoon at this point. My first question relates to the U.S. versus international traffic and ticket mix. When the numbers were quite similar in terms of total sales or comp growth ex gas and FX for U.S. international, I guess we were a bit less curious about how the traffic trends you are seeing that you report which I believe are our global \u2013 correct me if I am wrong \u2013 were different so any sense as to how different the traffic number is in the U.S. particularly over the past few months?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","No. I mean, again, the biggest factor was a year ago, with the gas \u2013 our view was it was gas related. We had a couple of months of mid 5s which was anomaly the other way, so we're just finishing comparing to that. One surprise would be in Canada. The underlying comp there is surprisingly strong given that oil prices are down. When I look at for Q2, in terms of kind of front end transaction growth, which is shopping frequency, that's how we measure it. Overall we were again in the low 3s or the mid-3s. The U.S. was in the mid-2s. Although that's impacted again by \u2013 more impacted than anybody by gas. And by gas a year ago the shopping frequency.","When I look internationally, it ranges from flat to up 14%. And no rhyme or reason it to. A little \u2013 well a little of it is in the Asian countries in Q2 was a little flatter because of opening new units as well.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. If I could also focus on sales for a second question, so I guess the difference really between January and February in the U.S. if you knock out the weather and Super Bowl, et cetera, it is actually seems to be at least in the overall number seems to be less about traffic and more about ticket. I know that there is a component of ticket that is obviously deflation. Is the decel in ticket ex-gas and FX in the past couple of months entirely about deflation or is there any change in basket size or units per basket, et cetera?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, it's basket size related to deflation.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So deflation pure and simple rather than any kind of units per transaction?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","A month ago \u2013 we don't do this all the time, but a month ago we had \u2013 Bob had everybody look \u2013 last two months, we looked at the basket size and the actual number of items in the basket? The number of items in the basket was up less than 1%, about 0.25%. And the average basket dollar amount was a little down. So that would imply again a little deflation, but we had to buy in slightly more things than a year ago.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Understood. And then finally on SG&A and the forward guide on wages just to be clear is what is different over the upcoming four quarters or so, simply the change in the entry-level hourly wage rather than the increases you would give your experienced team members or does that increase also flow through at a greater than usual rate to the...?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","The top of scale close to the same rate. But, again, if you have 60% percent of your employees who currently are making 22 or 23, whatever that top scale is, and every March we got to at $0.55, $0.60 an hour increase, we've experienced that through all times for 30 years percentage wise is pretty similar. The unique thing this time is the bottom of the scale which just taking \u2013 what would it be without it? And what'll be with it? It affects not only the entry level, it affects the first couple of increases. If we were at $11.50 and $12, was it \u2013 if we were $11.50 and $12 currently prior to now, three months or however many cumulative hours later, then somebody goes from $11.50 to $11.75. Then $11.75 to $12 or $12.25. Well, everybody below $13 is going to $13. But what's the incremental cost, all things being equal? The incremental cost is about $0.08 a share over the course of a year. It's a $0.01 this quarter because it's a partial quarter. And then it's more. It's about $0.02 a quarter. And then it will anniversary next year this time.","Matthew J. Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, and thanks for the transparency today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi, Richard. I just have a couple of questions I think. The first one is on the membership fee income growth, what would it have been without the impact of no American Express sign-ups?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","We don't measure it. On the margin we think somebody's coming to sign up because of us first and the co-brand card second. A distant second. Whether it's Amex or Citi Visa or anybody. They come in to be a member of Costco. I don't think they come to the desk and say never mind and walk away. So I think \u2013 now, because part of our relationship with our former partner and our upcoming new partner \u2013 current and soon-to-be-former partner and our upcoming new partner \u2013 is they do some marketing for us. They do some things to get people to come in also. So there's probably a little bit but we don't try to measure, we just know it's zero right now.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then in your softlines business, there has been some \u2013 the private label component I think has increased and I was just wondering if you could talk through a little bit on the impact that weather has played in that segment of your business both from like a markdown perspective but also in terms of what you are really seeing as buying opportunities throughout the last few months in the current market?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, the only thing that was impactful is I believe there was a relatively warm \u2013 there was more men's outer wear markdowns this last few months than we had historically but it was completely weather-related. And I didn't even point it out on the call. That's probably a little bit of softline's impact. That was one of the reasons that the softline's margins I mentioned year-over-year was a little down. Beyond that, at the last budget meeting when we were looking at the \u2013 some of the apparel buyers came and talked about some of the new seasonal things, we keep getting a few more brands. I can't think of any off the top of my head right now. But I think it's a consistent \u2013 we've enjoyed Apparel business with comps in the 10% to 15% range compound for a couple years now. And we're still seeing decent growth in those areas.","So it's a good category for us. I think we're trying a couple of men's athletic items. We've been very successful with the three pieces, the bottom, the top of the jacket. KS, I know we're bringing in a few other items on the men's pant. Not just the fancy wool pant but the khakis and the gabardines.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, just wanted to go back to the credit card transition. You've talked in the past about kind of reinvesting some of the savings but I think you just also mentioned maybe keeping a little bit of it. I'm just curious, is that a change, are you considering letting some more of that flow through \u2013 I mean you have had a lot of expense on the IT front now with the wage increase FX has been a headwind? So just curious if there is any change in how you are thinking about the savings there? And now that we are kind of very close to it, any comment on what those savings could be in terms of magnitude?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, no comments until we get there. So it really is going be probably not until early October when we report our year-end and fourth quarter numbers. Since early June would be the beginning of the first \u2013 about three weeks into our fourth quarter. So I can't really tell you anything about it. We've made no change in what piece of this bucket we're thinking of saving. If anything, as we went through the final negotiation several months ago of what the rewards structure would be, Craig pushed it further towards the customer, towards the member who would get this card. We want it to be a great card, and so if anything, we went the other way a little bit.","I just mentioned \u2013 perhaps I didn't mention it that when I talk to people, as people have talked to me, my standard line has been like anything we do, when we save a buck on a piece of merchandise, we can buy better, and we're going to give, as a rule of thumb, the majority of it maybe 80% even 90% back to the customer. We're going to do the same thing here, we're going give most of it back to the member.","That being said, again, in the throes of the final figuring out what exactly do we want the reward structure to be, and because we want that card to be top-of-wallet, as we do with our current co-brand. Top-of-wallet and be used not only at Costco but outside of Costco and to be used at Costco as much as possible. We \u2013 Craig pushed the envelope with us and with the third parties to make sure that that value proposition is geared more towards them than us. So there's been no change in terms of that.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. That is helpful. And then just on the transition, will you have any grace period for a member that say doesn't have the cobranded card but tends to use their AmEx at the store and didn't get a new card in the mail obviously but gets up to the register and goes to pay and you are not taking AmEx anymore or will they just have to find a debit card or have you thought about how to treat that situation?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, first of all, there's going be a lot of communication several times by us to our members about timing and everything. Contractually, there's a lot of things we can't do until near the end. There will be plenty of information provided. We're still going to upset a few members when they come in. We did it with gas pumps years ago when we stopped accepting certain things.","And \u2013 but at the end of the day, there will be plenty of opportunities. The fact is that there will be some members that have an existing Visa card in their wallet while we would prefer them to have ours. There will be cannibalization that way. Frankly, there will be some cannibalization. Look, whether it's American Express or Citi or any other big credit card issuer, they're the bank that determines credit eligibility for somebody signing up. Now that doesn't impact the portfolio people, all the people that have the current co-brand. They're going to get a new card similar in terms of credit capacity and things from their existing co-brand relationship. But somebody who has to sign up, there are millions of people that never got an Amex card because they couldn't. They have resorted to debit or cash or check. There are some of those people that haven't \u2013 will be thrilled. There's some debit cardholders that will do this. But when you add it all up, we think that it's a net \u2013 we know that it's a net positive certainly in terms of what we've negotiated, and we'll see where it goes from there.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got it. That's helpful and then if I could just ask one more on online. A lot of retailers are spending a lot of money investing in their online business. It has kind of pressured the margins for them there. I believe your e-commerce business is higher margin. Just curious how you think about spending there going forward and is that higher margin structure sustainable?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I'm sorry. Could you repeat that?","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","In terms of online, just a lot of retailers have been talking about how much they are investing in their online business and that pressuring their margins for that side of the business. I believe Costco's margins online are higher margin and I am just curious how you think about spending there, and is that higher margin structure for e-commerce as sustainable?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, first of all, our gross margins online are a little lower. Its operating margin is quite a bit higher because you have a substantially lower SG&A. Now the fact that we're not spending hundreds of millions of dollars online perhaps is part of that. But at the end of the day, we certainly make more when that dollar is sold online than it is in-store. And notwithstanding the fact that our gross margin, what we charge the member is lower online than it is in-store.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I guess the question is do you see that sustainable?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I do because the SG&A portion is so low and because we're so extreme.","Kelly Ann Bania - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for letting it go so long. I just wanted to poke at the environment that almost everyone seems to be operating in right now. I mean I think you talked about traffic and I assume February traffic is in that kind of 2 to 2.5 range too. Talked about the deflation outlook. We talked about wages going up. I guess as you kind of move forward here and this is not just a Costco question, I guess this is from an analyst perspective that covers a lot of retail, it seems like everybody is facing a lot of the same challenges. I mean, do you see a light at the end of the tunnel?","We had deflation now minus 1 maybe, we have wage inflation, we have traffic that has kind of come down a little bit. Not a great environment and so it seems again that maybe something has to give here. Is the wage inflation going to finally pick up demand? Where does this in your opinion kind of end? Even Costco which is probably one of the best retailers in the world domestically is feeling the pressure. And I'm just trying to understand what is the end game here generally and I don't know if you have any thoughts on that? That's my question.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I don't know if this will give you comfort or anxiety. We're going to keep doing what we do. In bad times, we probably have the benefit of being more aggressive to drive stuff. And if anything, I think we're doing it from a stronger position now than we've ever been in. We're going out there driving prices down. We see our competitive moat actually even relative to traditional brick and mortars, not only our direct competitors but other forms of \u2013 and not just clubs but other forms of category diamond retailers. That moat has widened a little bit of late \u2013 of late being the last year or two. And the answer around here is well, can we get a little more margin? And the answer is, of course no, if we could drive more business so we could make it tougher on everybody. So I think \u2013 and then again, I think some of the things we're doing in terms of our strength with our vendors and our global sourcing, all that stuff, that helps. We've got a \u2013 we're doing a lot of good things.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","So do you have concern though given the slow wind down that we are seeing, Richard, a little bit on the components I mentioned, higher costs, yet deflation and the traffic? I mean is that \u2013 I think someone asked what do you stay up at night? I mean I guess I'm old too, it's hard to stay up because you're getting old but generally does that get you a little nervous as you look at the business and is the broader economy that something is just a little off?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think I used the word earlier I quoted from some economist about toxic anxiety. The world is filled with it. Our economy is darn good compared to a lot of them out there. And the fact that wages are increasing and unemployment has improved, all that's positive. And frankly, higher wages at the lowest wage levels is, in my view, is a positive. I think we've just got our head down and doing a lot of good things. I think that what we're doing again on some of the global sourcing stuff is something that very few can touch. And the strength of our KS brand name, and we're going to figure out how to create more value.","So other than everybody in the world never wanting to leave their house and only typing stuff to order and get it at the front door, other than that risk, I think that the strength of our merchandising, the strength of our competitiveness, the fact that we're able to be successful in other countries, I come to every four-week budget meeting and listen to merchants and some of the things they're doing. And I go out and feel better about what we've got going on.","So in terms of \u2013 I think by the way, when it is tougher for everybody else, everybody else does it less extreme than us. They figure out ways to cut costs that aren't necessarily long-term the right way or as right of a way in our view. And maybe we're righteous and we're standing on our own pedestal here, but it seems to have worked for us through good and bad economies.","Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Thanks for taking my question.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Okay. We're going to take two more questions.","Operator","Okay. And your next one comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI.","Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. I have two questions, Richard. What drove the acceleration in membership fee income growth besides the Living Social program?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, Living Social had virtually no impact because it's deferred accounting. Even if we had a little bump in that first week, or last week of Q2, when the Living Social thing was happening, virtually none of it hits the income statement. Because for a new member, that $55 or $110 goes into the P&L over the next 12 months. And my guess is it's probably some strength a year earlier that we're not getting the full benefit of that.","Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It might even be strong membership.","Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI","That is the best reason. So I guess the second question then is on the ancillary business because I know these have been growing a lot and you gave us a few numbers I think last quarter. Is there any way to sort of pull those together and say what percentage of your members are doing a car rental or a travel program or car buying or one of these things that \u2013 is it 5% of the transactions if you think of it that way?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I think some of those services, it's 1% or less. I think one number that we've seen and presented in some of our PowerPoint Presentations, I think last year we had car rentals above about 2.5 million car rentals. Let's assume 2.5 million car rentals weren't 2.5 million mutually exclusive customers. But maybe it was 2 million members. I don't know if it's 1.5 million or 2 million. But if it was even 2 million members that would be less than 10%. Probably 7% or 8%. So, my guess is less than that. So, maybe 5%. We've got \u2013 not everybody needs a mortgage, not everybody is doing forms check printing. On some of the items like, as a percentage of our total membership base it low. But there's a lot of room for it to grow.","Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI","So basically that nice tailwind to gross margin, that could be there for a while if we continue to get...","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I think it is. I haven't \u2013 absolutely. It probably over time moves the needle a little. It definitely moves the needle a little positively.","Gregory Melich - Evercore ISI","Great. All right. Good luck.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. So just following up on the Living Social deal, understanding that the deferred accounting doesn't really impact it but how did that impact the total membership numbers for the quarter? And then also how was the retention rate really on the one that you had about 18 months ago?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I aggregate number of members, we signed up a few more than we did the last time. And I think the 4% increase would be lower and it would be somewhere north of zero and south of 4%.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. But the mechanics of the program when somebody buys that deal, they automatically they get it done. They don't have to take it to the warehouse to get activated?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","They buy the coupon or whatever online. They print it out. They go to the warehouse where they sign up for a membership.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. So you don't get those...","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It's that latter take that when we represent, when we recognize it as a member and when we start our deferred accounting. Which will be small in first year because you have offsets, you have a value proposition to that purchaser.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. So there could be more people that are signing up in the current quarter that we are in now that have purchased that deal?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","There will be. Yeah.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","And then I guess the second question would be just around \u2013 you didn't talk much about the other international business being flat in February. You did say something that the Chinese New Year but is there something going on in the Japan business? You haven't called it out in the monthly for a long time as being a real positive contributor to comps. Just any comment you can elaborate on for February for other international and then also specifically in Japan?","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I think in Japan the last couple years we've had probably a little more cannibalization and their economy is soft. I know of late, again, as it relates to the strong dollar, in all countries where the dollar is much stronger there is a little weakness in some of the bigger ticket items.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Not big but there's (1:37:40) a little.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Okay. Thank you, Richard.","Richard A. Galanti - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Well, thank you, everyone.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to hand the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer, the floor is yours.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Jerome, and good afternoon to everyone. I will start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements, except as required by law.","In today\u2019s press release, we reported operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the 12 weeks ended May 12th. Our reported net income for the quarter came in at $906 million or $2.05 per share. This compared to $750 million or $1.70 per share last year. As mentioned in the release this year's third quarter benefited from a nonrecurring tax item of $73 million or $0.16 per share.","Excluding this item, earnings for the fiscal third quarter were up 11% year-over-year. Net sales for the quarter came in at $33.96 billion, a 7.4% increase over the $31.62 billion sales figure last year and the quarter. Comparable sales for the third quarter were as follows. For the 12 weeks on a reported basis U.S. was 7.0%. Excluding gas inflation, FX and rev rec it was seven -- it would have been a 5.5%. Canada reported at a 1.3%, ex those items, a 5.1% positive.","Other International reported 1.7%; ex those items a 6.9% to the positive. So total company we reported a 5.5% comp sales figure for the 12 weeks. Excluding those three items almost negated each other coming in at 5.6% excluding those items. E-commerce was 22% for the quarter on a reported basis and 19.5% ex those items.","In terms of Q3 comp sales, our third quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased by 3.7% worldwide and up 3.4% in the U.S. In terms of the impact of the items of gas, FX and rev rec, weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 130 basis points. Gasoline price inflation impacted sales by a small amount plus 10 basis points and rev rec benefited comp sales by about 110 basis points. So the net of the three about a minus 10 basis points.","Our average front-end transaction or ticket was up 1.8% during the third quarter. And excluding the impacts from gas, FX and rev rec, our average ticket was up approximately 1.9%.","Next on the income statement membership fee income. We reported membership income in the third quarter of $776 million or 2.29% of sales. This is up $39 million or 5.3% from last year's $737 million. FX had a negative impact on that number that impacted the $39 million increase would have been about just under $10 million higher than that ex-FX.","Our reported membership fee revenue again was up to $39 million or 5.3%. In addition to FX impacting that to the negative it does have the benefit of the fee increases we took almost two years ago. Really the last fiscal quarter of that those increases that we took in June of 2017 in the U.S. and Canada.","We now have effectively completed that 23-month cycle that takes to recognize the incremental benefit from the fee increases. The benefit to our P&L in Q4 will be very small less than $1 million. In terms of renewal rates, at Q3 end, our membership rates -- renewal rates remain strong. In the U.S. and Canada membership renewal rates came in at 90.7% the same as it was a quarter ago. And worldwide the rate was 88.3%. That figure also the same as of Q2 end.","In terms of the number of members at Q3 end, the number of member households we had was 53.1 million at Q3 end, that's up from 52.7 million 12 weeks earlier. In terms of total cardholders, we came in at 97.2 million, up from 96.3 million 12 weeks earlier at Q2 end.","During the quarter, we opened three new warehouses one each in the United States, Korea, and Australia. At Q3 end in terms of paid Executive members, they stood at 20.4 million which was an increase of 406,000 during the quarter or 34,000 per week.","Korea was actually a very small piece of that increase, so we've had a good continued increases in Executive Member penetration in other countries as well, most notably U.S. and Canada. Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by six basis points coming in at 10.99% versus last year's 11.05%.","Now, excluding the items that I've excluded before FX rev rec and the like the six basis point lower number would be actually plus five basis points excluding gas inflation and rev rec. If I ask you to jot down a couple of numbers here, two columns both reported and an ex-gas inflation and revenue recognition for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to a year earlier. The first line item here would be core merchandise.","On a reported basis year-over-year in the quarter it was reported one basis point lower. Ex-gas and rev rec it was nine basis points positive; ancillary businesses minus three and minus one basis point; 2% reward, minus two and minus three. And something [along those lines] [ph] you'd have the reported number six basis points lower and ex-gas and rev rec five basis points higher.","One thing you all note compared to last -- the second quarter, in the second quarter we had a big increase in ancillary business margin as we pointed out last quarter's earnings release. The core merchandise component here again lower by one basis point. If you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales core-on-core if you will margins year-over-year were higher in Q3 year-over-year by 21 basis points. The subcategories within the quarter all four named subcategories food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods were all up year-over-year in the third quarter on their own sales.","And that's a trend that we've seen last quarter. It was up less than that amount in Q1, down a little bit year-over-year. Ancillary and other businesses gross margin again lower by one basis point on the ex-gas and rev rec. Nothing really to speak off in terms of things there.","Moving to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage Q3-over-Q3 was lower or better by six basis points coming in at 9.92% of sales this year. This compares to 9.98% reported last year. Ex gas inflation and rev rec it was higher or slightly worse by five basis points.","Again to jot down a few numbers here in the two columns. Reported in the second column without gas inflation and rev rec gas inflation and rev rec. Our core operations on a reported basis was better by seven basis points so plus seven. Ex rev rec minus two. Central, minus one and minus two basis points. Stock compensation zero and minus one. Summing up those two columns, again on a reported basis SG&A was lower or better by plus six basis points and ex those other items worse by five basis points.","Now the key thing here is within the seven basis points of improvement or rather the minus two basis points ex gas and rev rec, that\u2019s notwithstanding the fact that we're still facing pretty big headwinds from the U.S. wage increases to our hourly employees that went into effect in June of 2018 as well as additional wage increases implemented in March of 2019. Both of these wage increases negatively impacted SG&A during the quarter, representing about 10 to 12 basis points of the year-over-year variance.","In Q4, the estimated impact will be about minus five to six basis points, which is the residual impact from June of 2018 plus the March 2019 increases. And then we'll tick down to three to four basis points and that's what we estimate in Q1 of 2020. Central, nothing to speak out there. It was higher by two basis points on an ex gas and rev rec basis. Stock compensation flat year-over-year and then [again] [ph] minus one.","Next on the income statement is preopening expense. Preopening expense came in at $14 million this year into Q3, up $6 million from a year ago. We have one additional opening, three opening this year versus two last year. There was also about $2 million of preopening expense in the number related to the chicken plant that we plan to start at the beginning of production in later this summer.","Additionally some of these quarters expense relates to our higher number of openings we have in Q4 in Qs one through three in the first 36 weeks of this year, we will open a total of 10 new locations in Q4 we have 11 planned. So there was some remnants in the beginning of some of the preopening there.","All told, reported operating income in Q3 was up 5% coming in at $1,122 million this year, compared to $1,067 million last year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was $2 million lower or better year-over-year coming in at $35 million versus $37 million. That's just a slight difference in capitalized interest amounts.","Interest income and other for the quarter was lower by $5 million year-over-year. Interest income itself was actually higher by $11 million year-over-year. However, various FX items in the amount of a minus $16 million negatively impacted the year-over-year comparison. Overall pre-tax income in Q3 was also up 5% coming in at $1,123 million this year versus $1,071 million last year.","In terms of income taxes, our reported tax rate in Q3 of fiscal 2019 was 18.5%, compared to 28.8% in Q3 last year. As was mentioned in today's release this quarter's earnings and our tax rate benefited from a nonrecurring $73 million item. Excluding the $73 million item, our third quarter tax rate would have been 24.9%. We estimate that our effective total company tax rate for fiscal Q4 of fiscal 2019 to be more in the 26.5% to 27% range.","A few other items of note. In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we've opened through the third quarter to-date a total of -- actually opened 12 units -- I'm sorry opened 13 units, but that includes three relocations and so net of 10. In Q4, we'll open 13 locations which includes two relos, so net of 11 which should put us in terms of net new openings for the fiscal year at 21, the same number that we had in fiscal 2018.","About three quarters of the openings this year are in the U.S. and about quarter internationally. This also includes our anticipation of opening our first Costco in China, in Shanghai tentatively scheduled to open on August 27th right before the fiscal year ends.","As of Q3 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 112 million square feet. In terms of CapEx, while our new warehouse openings remains in the low 20s, the CapEx then is in line with prior years. Excuse me; it's in line with prior years. We've got a lot of money being spent on fulfillment, both e-commerce and grocery expansion and automation, the chicken plant which is what we mentioned; as well as ongoing expansion and depot infrastructure as well as IT modernization.","In terms of stock buybacks in Q3, during the third quarter, we expended $44 million repurchasing 192,000 shares at an average price of $226.57. To-date we've expended $195 million or 903,000 shares at about a $216 per share price. As a reminder, the last Board meeting, the Board approved the reauthorization of a stock repurchase program. They authorized a new $4 billion program that will remain in effect through April 2023.","In terms of e-commerce, overall our e-commerce sales increased as we mentioned in a comp basis 19.5%; reported 22%; 19.5% ex-FX and gas. I might point out by the way that these numbers do not include the increases that we're seeing with Instacart. Instacart comes into our warehouses and purchases and that goes into warehouse sales.","The top growth categories in the quarter were electronics, health and beauty aids, furniture, small appliances, automotive, and optical. And new brands and items online during the quarter include high end televisions from Sony and Samsung as well as the latest generation of Apple products from AirPods to iMax and the like.","Other things will include things like bare minerals beauty cosmetics. Sales highlights for the quarter included some significant diamond repurchases one in the $400,000 range and big-ticket items like golf simulators that sold for $14,000 each which we sold during the fine pay period.","We also continue to improve our online and in-line cross marketing initiatives. A lot of push notifications for start and end of warehouse promotions. E-mails featuring hot items and suggestions for Mother's Day and other holidays like Cinco de Mayo.","During the quarter, we also completed the rollout of six regional grocery distribution centers located within our existing depots. You'll recall that previously we had fulfilled since late 2017 when we began the two-day grocery, we did that through our business centers. As it expands, we pushed into our depot operations and we'll also have in those cases regional assortments.","An update on in terms of our buying online and pick up in store, in the quarter, we began rolling out additional pickup lockers. Over the last several months we've had been locations, but we're in the process of rolling that out to one additional 100 locations over the next four or five months before the September through December holiday season.","Continued growth in Costco app use among our members. We continue to experience that with new features recently added like pharmacy orders and pick up notifications, easier shopping ability on member savings events, photo center, and various push notifications and expect several additional new features are planned for July in the upcoming months thereafter.","We continue to focus on getting merchandise to customers faster. Some of that has to do with where we locate the merchandise in these depot and other ancillary operations. As discussed last quarter, we will begin e-commerce operations in Japan later this summer; and Australia late summer early fall.","Next thing I want to touch on for a minute is the whole question of tariffs. I'm sure we'll be getting some questions on that, so a few comments. As we indicated a couple of quarters ago in our earnings release, there continue to be a lot of moving parts, although some of the moving parts are getting bigger and but it is still pretty fluid.","The actions that we took then and we continue to take where we're able to -- not in a big way we're accelerating shipments before certain tariffs we pull into effect or will be increased as a percentage of the tariffs although there is limited ability to do that. We worked with suppliers. We've gotten to potentially every supplier on every item as you might expect to see what we can do to both reduce cost and figure out how to do that.","In some cases, we've reduced order commitments on certain items. We look at alternative country sourcing where possible and feasible, although again, there's a limited amount of the ability to do that. And we've taken advantage of lower pricing on certain U.S. items that have been impacted the other way.","In summary, we'll continue to see our customers competitors react to this. What's interesting is if you -- as you know this list three which is the biggest of the three lists of potential tariff items, those were listed back in September of 2018 at 10% tariffs and we're going to go to 25% at December -- as of December 31st of 2018. That data continue to move although it's now moved into its in fact it 25% for items that I believe are exported after meeting. So we're just starting to see some of those impacts.","As you might expect it's all over the Board in terms of every activity of the vendor is different. In some cases, it's being passed on. In some cases, we're able to work to figure out how to move merchandise and then the impact of when the price increase does go through. It has a different impact of how it affects sales. We think that we are in a good position in terms of our size and our ability and our relationships with our vendors and we'll keep you posted how it goes.","This last piece that again includes -- it's the biggest list of the three lists and includes things like furniture, luggage, banks, vacuums, gross, and more items like that. That's pretty much it on our side. And lastly in terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending this Sunday June 2nd, next Wednesday June 5th after the market closes.","And with that I will open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Jerome. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Now, our first question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael, you are now live.","Michael Lasser","Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, how are you going to comp the $400,000 diamond ring? It's going to be tough next year.","Richard Galanti","Well, do you have an anniversary coming up.","Michael Lasser","Even if I did, I can't afford it. My question relates to the comp. The traffic\u2019s been moderating a bit, should we think about this as just more reversion to the mean? Or do you think that there's something else going on?","Richard Galanti","Well, look every time it reminds me of a few years ago when we saw a slight moderation in traffic and it was, oh my God, this is the new normal. And our answered then was we don't know what the -- we don't know if it is or it isn't. What we know is we've got a lot of exciting things going on in buying. We certainly -- the different buckets of money we talked about over the last few years whether it's the fee income for membership fee increases, the credit cards switch, the tax reform, all those things don't go away. They in fact grow each year a little bit. And so I think that we feel that we're in a good position to keep driving it.","As it relates to where it goes from here, we'll have to see. We think relatively speaking our value proposition is as strong if not stronger than it\u2019s ever been out there. And we'll have to see where it goes. Now what are some of the headwinds? Recent headwinds included the weather and other things that started back in February. Certainly this new word with a capital T called Tariff there's questions out there that we read about every day and we\u2019ll see.","Again we feel whatever the impact is, we feel that in the earlier tariffs last year, recognizing many of them were in the 10% range not a 25% range, we actually felt we picked up a little market share in some cases. We don't know what will happen tomorrow, but we feel we're in a good position from a buying power standpoint and certainly have the ability to drive sales the way we know how to do it with good value.","Michael Lasser","My follow-up question is your core-on-core gross margin expanded rate that accelerate quite a bit from the last couple of quarters. Is that because of what you are doing proactively? Or is it just that the market becoming a little less competitive and as a result you're able to earn a little bit more in your sales?","Richard Galanti","I think it's a little of everything. I think some of its internal controls. We still manage the basics, managing spoilage and D&D, and negotiating with vendors. It's a lot easier to do that. Our buying power, and our strength per item is enormous given our $150 billion is over 4,000 given items at a given time.","Certainly I get back to some of those other buckets we've had available. We're able to use those and we're able to -- we've also been able to show that we drive even greater value. We -- the vendor sees a big increase in pick up in the unit sales and I think that's worked in our benefit. ","Michael Lasser","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward, you are now live.","Edward Kelly","Yeah, hi Richard. I wanted to ask you about margins. Just the performance on the core margin and then the core-on-core, which obviously was even better. Any additional color on the puts and takes there? And then how we should maybe be thinking about that for the remainder of the year particularly as tariff starts to accelerate?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, look when \u2013 we've obviously been asked when prices are going up, when cost are going up we want to be the last to raise them. And when prices are going down we want to be the first to lower them. We're not afraid to use some of those monies to again drive business. I think a lot of things worked in our favor this quarter. Just when you get comfortable with us we'll do something else, right?","But there's -- again we don't really give -- provide direction or guidance on where it will go in the future. We feel pretty good right now about our competitive position relative to both in line and online and the value proposition that we bring. In fact, some of the weakness whether it's tariff related or whatever it's related, in some cases, we feel that it gives us a leg up as it relates to we can go in there and buy large quantities of something at great value. And these are all anecdotal comments though. Overall, we feel again good about our competitive position and the things that we have in the pipeline as it relates to having good - great merchandise and great prices.","Edward Kelly","And just maybe a follow-up on the tariff side. As we think about this three and we think about 25% your philosophy I guess generally you've always been a bit more of a customer-first organization. Is there a margin risk associated with that? And then as we think about any potential for list four, how strategically would you think about that?","Richard Galanti","Well, there's always risk. At some point, you can't [indiscernible] all these tariffs. We work with vendors. There's been some switching a small amount of switching to other countries of origin where we can, although we're not the only one in town trying to do that.","At the end of the day prices will go up on things. What's interesting is that it's hard to predict what the impact is. We've seen strengthened patio furniture even with certain tariff price increases although part of that is because there was a little bit of slowdown in patio furniture because of the bad weather in January, February and we get into seasons early. So, again, it's hard to analyze each one. I think what we're most cognizant of is a key price point. If you're something at $9.99, you hate to go to a new calculation that was at $10.49. But if it's 25% on $9.99, needless to say you're not worried about $10.49 you've got to figure out where it is above that.","And again I think we've done everything we can and we'll see where it goes from here. And then the real unknown is how long it's going to last. And to the extent it gets into list four, that's a whole new ballgame as well. That's the rest of everything, if you will, including electronics and apparel and the phones and televisions.","And so the more discretionary item is we were -- again I think a little conservatively surprised on the patio side, although we also have to recognize there were some build up because the weather. It took a little bit while for the weather to turn. And -- but if you start getting 25% tariffs on that list four, the list four is not here yet. And we're hopeful that the ebbs and flows of the relations between our countries improves in that regard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open,","Josh Kamboj","Hi, this is Josh Kamboj joined for Simeon. Thank you for taking our question. The expense leverage that you saw in the quarter was encouraging especially against the wage headwinds that you're facing. Can you maybe go into a little bit more detail about what's driving those specifically? And then ignoring the benefit from lapping that wage increase next year, can you continue to drive expense leverage in the same areas for the foreseeable future to offset tariffs?","Richard Galanti","Look the biggest \u2013 depending on the level of tariffs, if it's lot, no. But as we've always said, we're \u2013 the biggest thing is driving sales. If we can drive sales, we're not very good at leveraging expenses of sales or weakening relative to others perhaps because there are things we're not going to do. We're not going to postpone a wage increase and things like that.","And we work on expenses every day and every week and every month at our budget meetings literally, and I think we \u2013 again, there will be a little reduced headwind in each of the next few quarters with the big increase as we saw an hourly wages both in June of 2017 and now in March \u2013 sorry in June of 2018 and now in March of 2019 as those \u2013 that 10 to 12 negative goes to six or seven goes to four or five or whatever I said earlier.","Beyond that, there's also \u2013 I mean, there is basis points here and there that go both ways. A lot of the things we're doing like this \u2013 the new fulfillment centers, the automation, none of this stuff goes completely smoothly. And we don't point out each one of these things, but I'm sure there's some extra hits of half basis points here and half points there and there is other things that improve. At the end of the day sales is paramount.","The other thing is that as \u2013 I think not over this next year, but over the next several years to the extent that we have a higher increase of openings outside the United States that tends to help the overall percentages on things like health care. Health care is 30 to 70 basis points higher in every other country than in the U.S. things like that. And so \u2013 I'm sorry, lower, health care expense as a percent of sales is lower in every other country outside the United States.","So there is \u2013 we've been fortunate that our comps [after works] [ph] and virtually every other country we've gone to take some time, it takes a few years to get there, when we first opened in a country. But at the end of the day that will help. And that's not going to help tomorrow. That's over the next 5 and 10 years.","Josh Kamboj","Okay. Thank you. And Just as a quick follow-up following up on some of the other questions a little bit more directly. Do you think over the next few quarters your merch margin can continue to expand if it's the core-on-core one as tariffs have greater impact on your business?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, we don't guide. That's why \u2013 I should say stop. But look tariffs to the extent that we want to be the last to raise prices, it doesn't mean we're going to wait and not do it at all. We've had to be pragmatic about it, but net-net those that would be a drag a little bit of a drag. Now hopefully, it's a grab from a plus \u2013 a drag from a plus 20 not a minus 5.","Josh Kamboj","Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC market. Scot, you are now live.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good afternoon, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. I was curious, if you guys have considered providing a quick-and-collect kind of process for your grocery offering given the success that Walmart had with their grocery pickup?","Richard Galanti","Not at this juncture. I mean, the click and collect that we're doing is simply \u2013 as more for small size big-ticket items like electronics and jewelry and handbags. We continue to look at it. We continue to scratch our heads about it. We recognize that they and some others are putting in a lot of financial commitment to doing this. I think what you're going to find is like everything else in life at Costco over time we figure out how to do it our way that makes sense for us that still works.","One of the reasons that whether it's Instacart or a smaller scale shipped in the Southeast, which is growing its geographic footprint as well as Google, all those things are ways to do that without us having to get into that business in a big way. And that's on two-day. And recognizing if somebody wants something in an hour, they're probably not going to get it from us.","But what we see is \u2013 the other thing is we still want to drive into the warehouse, and so far what we see in small bite-size this year and some of the things we've done, the net of having that one-day grocery with third parties or two-day drag grocery through us, it has been slightly additive. So it's not cannibalizing -- well it cannibalizes the number of business to our warehouse a little, some of the -- still is an increase in sales. These are small data points over a short period of time, so we have to see it. But we'll figure out how to keep doing it our way and hopefully that will work.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. So, really nothing in the near future. Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Chuck, you are now live.","Chuck Grom","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks. Richard, just in light of the trade war, rhetoric and market volatility and some of the concerns, I\u2019m just wondering if you've seen any change in the consumer behavior particularly in some of your more important market such as California. PVH was out saying some things last night. Curious if you're seeing anything on your consumer?","Richard Galanti","No. We really haven't.","Chuck Grom","No? Okay, great. And just thinking on Ed\u2019s question about operating margins, they are much stronger than a decade ago. And frankly not many in retail can say that. I\u2019m just curious when you look ahead, you think bigger picture about some of the puts and takes what do you think about operating margin dollar growth in the future?","Richard Galanti","I guess, more, more. The slides that has been shown at our international managers meeting every year for that three or four-day event from the beginning of time and through Craig Jelinek's tenure over the last eight years, we're a top line company. And as long as we can keep driving sales all those other things fall into place.","The fact that we have been successful longer than I thought and continuing to get more people to convert to Executive Membership, the benefit that we have with great value on a credit card, all those things drive loyalty and will drive sales and everything else will take care of itself. And we feel pretty comfortable right now with the recognizing the value is not just price, the price is still the biggest piece of value on what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Mandeville from Jefferies. Christopher, you are now live.","Christopher Mandeville","Hi, good evening. Can I just ask in terms of competition on the consumable side, are you seeing anything notable in terms of change on pricing, whether it be greater aggression or maybe a greater willingness to pass on overall cost inflation? And I guess I am definitely curious about categories like eggs and pork where we've seen some significant deviations on pricing?","Richard Galanti","I mean, pork has been over the board as I understand. But overall \u2013 the answer to your overall question is not really. If anything, I mean using gasoline as an extreme example, I think the fact that our -- most gasoline retailers have been willing to make more on gas and has enabled us to have a bigger value GAAP and make a little more. And so that suited us well.","Again I think we're fortunate that many of the price wars are out there, the traditional retailers at any given category are impacting a lot more than we are on those things. So that's -- I think we've been fortunate. And on basics, what I call the supermarket ads of yesteryears, we've been watching those every week since the beginning of time and continue to do so.","And where we helped ourselves is in areas of private label and areas of organic and specialty items. I mean you go into even something as basic as cheeses. We're not just selling to basics cheeses anymore. We're selling premium cheeses. And I think in everything we do and packaged food items, we stepped up the quality and whether it's organic or antibiotic free or you name it. And those things we're able to show a to show a great savings and still maintain a decent margin. ","Christopher Mandeville","Okay. And you brought up fuel. I guess I'm curious that the comments on being able to capture maybe a little bit more margin all while expanding the gap relative to competition. Is that broad-based across the country? Or is it more so confined to areas like state of California? And then can you just speak to growth on gallons in the quarter? ","Richard Galanti","As I understand it the only geographic region in the U.S. where that's not the case is parts of the Midwest and it ebbs and flows there. Everywhere else it's been pretty healthy for us. And I think the gas -- the value gas when you look at some of these third-party websites that collect from millions of people across the country on pricing, we continue to be shown as the best value out there. ","Christopher Mandeville","And anything on the comps for gallon growth?","Richard Galanti","They continue to be in the -- I believe they're still in the high single digits in gallons. Yes, they continue in this quarter to be in the high single digits, whereas I think U.S. gallon consumption is in the low single digits. We're driving people into the parking lot. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Karen you are now live.","Karen Short","I'm wondering -- on core growth margin is there any benefit to core-on-core maybe from timing in terms of accelerating delivery of items that may be passing on some price increases because -- I mean it sounds like it could be a little more structural in nature although, I know you don't really want to commit to that? And then I had another question. ","Richard Galanti","Not really because in our mobility we kept of the cost down. Even as costs went up and we had it sooner we held it off. We held off raising price until we were into a higher cost unit or product.","Karen Short","Okay. And then I guess then that would lead us to think that there may be something more structural in terms of what we saw on core-on-core? Or are you reluctant to go down that path? ","Richard Galanti","Look. Again I guess, I choose to use the world that we try to be pragmatic about it. We didn't look back two quarters ago and say core-on-core was down five or six basis points year-over-year and then last quarter it was up seven or eight or whatever we reported and now it's up 20. We didn't strategically plan to do with like that. It's our buying power.","I think in some of these weak times in certain categories, apparel is an example. We can go in and buy huge quantities of something where the manufacturer's volumes have been cut by other merchants and really drive great value and people love it and even give even a greater value to the customer. The private label is a little bit -- product mix is a little bit. Certainly private label is a little of it.","Karen Short","Okay. And then if we get -- if list four does get implemented, what percent is actually imported from China in totality? Or what will be the increase on what's imported directly from China? Or do you just have no way of calculating that really?","Richard Galanti","There's really not an easy way to calculate it. First of all, list four is somewhat titled everything else, but who knows what everything else is once it goes through that few months' process of exceptions and people appealing the process.","And look it's more significant in the sense that there's some categories that are arguably discretionary in nature. Apparel to some extent, electronics certainly, and more people put that off. Again getting back to patio furniture, we didn't see it, although, we believe part of that is related to just the season starting a little later this year.","Karen Short","Okay. And then just last question from me. I think testing self-check-out in some stores, maybe can you just give an update on how many stores that's been? And then any color on what you're seeing with respect to traffic in those stores where that's been rolled out?","Richard Galanti","Of the 540-ish locations in the U. S. it's in about 125, we're going to move to 250 in rapid order over the next several months. It works -- by the way for us it works best in high-volume locations where it's got a lot easier, particularly if you have a credit card now where you can just contactless.","And it's very fast and customers are using it. Our members are using it. And it's saving some labor at the front end. As important, on the highest volume units, it's getting people through the front end faster which we recognize when you get -- if our average unit is in the 180, 190 range they get a lot of units in the 250 to 350 range that helps.","Karen Short","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich from Evercore ISI. Gregory, you're now live.","Gregory Melich","Hi thanks. Richard can you give us a little more on the e-commerce front? Specifically, is it still more profitable from a margin standpoint than retail globally? And how could that change as you know roll out into Japan and Australia, how should we think about that?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind U.S. doors everybody else Canada doors everybody else to some extent portion to the size of our company. Overall, it's more profitable recognizing we don't charge back every item. There's a charge that the warehouse gets for accepting merchandise and things like that.","At the end of the day, it's -- we think it's slightly more profitable at a lower gross margin. And there's certain categories like -- I mean the most notable one is white goods. Four years ago in the U.S., we did maybe 50 million in limited amount of white good sales, meaning refrigerators, washers, and dryers and the like. Now, we display a few items in-store in three \u2013 go out three fiscal years, which was last year's fiscal 2018, we did 50 something, 500-plus, a little over $500 million, and that should be \u2013 we should be able to double that to go over $700 million this year.","So double that in a few years. So that's a category that by necessity nobody was going to go pick it up buy in and pick it up anywhere else anymore. And this has enabled us to have \u2013 so there is those kinds of things that have helped as well, where we would have lost some of that business, I think over time in the warehouse anyway.","Patio Furniture or -- Patio Furniture during the 12 weeks to 16 weeks in the January through April period, predominantly and regular furniture during the kind of after Memorial Day and before back-to-school during the 10 or so weeks in the middle of summer, that's when we sold that stuff. Now, we sell some of that stuff year-round online most notably Patio Furniture that we sell year-round in decent amount in geographies where the sun actually shines more often.","Gregory Melich","Got it. And so is it fair to say that still that e-commerce business is very general merchandise-heavy? And can you update us on what vendor direct is as a percentage of that business or just \u2013 and how big it is as a percent of sales?","Richard Galanti","Well, vendor direct, yeah. When we first started years ago, it was mostly all vendor direct, because it was big ticket. It was solely big-ticket items being shipped \u2013 drop shipped. That's a lot of smaller percentage today than it's ever been. First of all, in addition over the last few years, where we have gone as to, one, improve the site greatly itself, whether its search, returns, you name it. But we've added categories to create more velocity and more reasons for you some of you to think about the going to costco.com, whether its health and beauty aids or food and sundries and things like that.","And so I think you'll see that continue, one of the reasons that we're doing some of these automation fulfillment for small packages. If you will and that's the natural progression of how we do things. And I was reading an article just this morning about \u2013 the writer was suggesting a small percentage of our members shop online at Costco. That's in this small relative to others, but it's increased each year and has increasing at a greater level now. And we're getting better at it. But again, we still want to use the Internet to get to the end of the store as well, and we think we done a pretty good job of both of those.","Gregory Melich","Great. And just a clarification on the tariffs, it sounds like \u2013 if just pick a number let's say 15% a year COGS came from China. List three would be less than half of that and list four theoretically would be bigger if it went on everything it. Is that fair?","Richard Galanti","List four would be -- yes absolutely.","Gregory Melich","Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Richard Galanti","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John, you are now live.","John Heinbockel","So Richard, let me start with the sequential improvement in core-on-core, I'll beat that horse again. Is that fairly broad based right the 8 to the 21? And then secondly, I don't think you guys don't spend a lot of time thinking about item-by-item elasticity or do you? And a real good sense where \u2013 where the \u2013 where some of that can be given back productively?","Richard Galanti","Right. It is broad-based and we certainly do not think a lot about price elasticity. Are there \u2013 well, we think about price elasticity in one direction, if we lower the price where we sell more, and you know, if you think back John a couple \u2013 two or three years ago when we restructured the MVM, which had worked well in group sequentially over 15 years -- plus years and it was a little stale. And so we changed it up a few items of greater values each. And what we found is on some cases it worked, and on some cases it didn't. But I don't think we ever think about what if we raised the price and sell 2% less units.","John Heinbockel","Yeah, I'm thinking more on the -- if we cut the price, if we were invest some of our core-on-core benefit, can we get more share or we're just pushing on the strengths?","Richard Galanti","We do that. And I think we tried the most extreme example of saying can we drive more value out of more volume. And if we can't, we don't stubbornly push on a string in every case.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then secondly, where do you think we stand gross and net openings for next year right? So I know you probably have wanted to get up both of those right. Gross openings probably in the high 20s and maybe a you get a bit higher than it's been. And obviously you open Shanghai, but what's going on with China? Does that give you any pause for additional openings beyond Shanghai? Or no you're still looking for real estate?","Richard Galanti","Well, at this juncture we have two locations, one we're opening this late summer, and one that we will -- if all things go well about a year almost two years from now. So I should say 1.5 years plus after the first one opens. That's not that different than what we've done in other countries.","I think in Australia we opened three over the first four years. I think in Japan we opened five. We opened actually six over five years, in Spain we open two over four years. So that's not inconsistent. We'll continue; when they're there, Craig and real estate guys and Jim Murphy, the Head of International and the local country managers, they're looking at other sites. But right now we want to get to -- look China's a little unique in many ways aside from any issues right now with tariffs. That's not hopefully a long-term issue. Each item has to be registered separately.","We're fortunate in the sense that we have a successful operation in Taiwan, which we were able to bring some key people. But we want to hire from within and like we do in other countries start with a very small core group of people that are expats but really growing internally. And if it's also -- what we said is if new country's very successful, we're perfectly happy to have a couple of units over the first two or three years and four or five total units, four or five years after we opened our first, we'll go from there.","John Heinbockel","And your thoughts on opening this coming year?","Richard Galanti","Excuse me?","John Heinbockel","This coming year, 2019 or August of 2020, early thoughts on gross and net? Where would that goes to this year?","Richard Galanti","Yeah, I think the next year we\u2019ll look about the same amount as this year. ","John Heinbockel","All right. So like mid-20s growth and low 20s net?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","John Heinbockel","Okay. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott. You are now live.","Scott Mushkin","Hey, guys thanks for taking my question. I got two questions. Richard, you talked about driving top line sales and that's the key \u2013 the company everything else takes care of itself. And if you look back over the last I guess five years did a huge expansion, even blew out a number of centers to add to the fresh, so I think that helped a lot. The credit card helped a lot. When you look out over the next year or two or three, what do you see pretty substantial? What do you see as similar type of sales drivers potential?","Richard Galanti","Well I think we continue to see - first of all I think fresh foods is -- continues to evolve and grow. Specialty items within both food and nonfood; organic, both fresh and shelf stable one of the think that's again -- the good news in my view is a lot of these -- there's lots of different things not one giant thing.","We continue to add gas stations in other countries besides U.S. and Canada. It works. E-commerce as I mentioned, we added to two more countries this year. All those things add on each other. One of the things that we historically have not done a lot and again this is not a game changer overnight in terms of our performance is, we're very -- we've been very good at taking items in the U.S. and bringing them elsewhere and maybe to a small extent some Canadian items because of the size that were up there.","We've been bringing and continuing to test items that we find in other countries that are high end specialty unique items and we're getting some success with that. It's a small thing right now, but we're very good at figuring out how to do that and taking it to the next step.","So I think you and I continue to -- we're merchants and we're the best price. And I think that's more than anything what you'll see with us. I think we're doing a better job on the membership site in terms of converting people to executive. We're still seeing good sign-ups with the credit card. And as those rewards get bigger we believe that number becomes even more loyal.","So I think we continue to see -- the good news is that concerns that many of you have had over the years and we haven't moved fast enough in certain areas whether it's internet or e-commerce there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out there and we're benefiting from some of that.","So I got to tell you I come to every -- I go to every budget meeting and you hear the merchants or the merchants from some of the other countries talk about some of the things that we're doing. I think that's exciting. We're now in a size from a value proposition, there's certain both high-volume Kirkland items and paper goods and the like order where we're now in the size where we can produce them in another country at the same quality level and dramatically lower in freight cost.","Now this is not across the board on everything, but there's lots of those types of opportunities that we continue to do. There's not a shortage of things to stay busy trying to drive our business around here that we feel pretty good about.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. And then my follow-up question really goes to the competitive climate. And we're seeing that may be one of your competitors -- biggest competitors is kind of tacked a little bit differently. Maybe they were investing a lot in price a year ago and not so much now. Is that part of what's going on with the core-on-core gross margins? Is it the competitive climate is just a little bit easier? ","Richard Galanti","It's really across the board with traditional retailer as well. One of the things that I mentioned on the last few quarters because on this side -- on the fresh side they become and continue to be more competitive than they have been historically. That's the nature of the beast. But I think again we're not competing with just one direct competitor. We're competing with traditional merchandise retailers and supermarkets. And on an overall basis, we haven't seen any dramatic change. ","Scott Mushkin","So you see the competitive climate is stable, not worsening not getting better?","Richard Galanti","I think that's fair.","Scott Mushkin","All right. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh, you are now live.","Erica Eiler","Good afternoon. This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Thanks for taking our question. So, I was actually hoping to dive a little bit deeper into your online grocery efforts. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about how the Instacart and dry grocery ramps are going so far and what you're seeing with these offerings? And then any metrics you can provide such as type of basket you're seeing into how you're viewing the incrementality of the purchase, et cetera, would be helpful.","Richard Galanti","Yes. Look today -- first of all the 2-day drive which we do with UPS primarily is now the entire Continental United States. Much of it arrives in one day, but we guarantee two-day. And it's expanding and we're obviously getting small number of sign-ups where that member is signing up just to receive online because they're too far away from driving.","On Instacart they to ask you I'm sure you know have dramatically increased and their geographic footprint over the last two or three years. I think the thing that's most notable is that the value proposition to someone buying either directly from Instacart going into their site or go into our same-day grocery site -- one-day -- one day, sorry one-day grocery site which is the Instacart engine for fresh, we dramatically improve the value proposition over the last two years.","And I think that's reflective of the fact that they've grown and have their own structure in place. And if we believe we can do that anchor tag customer anchor-type tenant in terms of driving value. And so we have sequentially I think now four times brought down pricing over the last two years of what the ultimate markup on goods is above what you can walk into a customer --. And so we're doing more business. It's growing at big numbers high double-digit numbers, but it's on a small base.","Erica Eiler","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Simeon Siegel from Nomura. Simeon, your line is now live.","Conference Call Participant","Hey guys, this is Steve [ph] on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. So, apparel has obviously been a huge call out for you guys, but it looks like the soft line comps have been trending a little bit lower over the last couple of months kind of towards the mid-single-digit range. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing within the category, any notable call out there?","Richard Galanti","Hold on. Within soft lines and jewelry, that's been a little soft. Household furniture although some of that had to do with -- I don't know it's been a little soft.","Conference Call Participant","All right. If I can sneak a little more in. On the MSI growth, did you guys call out what exactly was the fee high contribution for the quarter?","Richard Galanti","$10 million.","Conference Call Participant","$10 million. All right, great. Thanks guys.","Richard Galanti","Thank you very much. Have a great afternoon everyone.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes Costco's third quarter earnings conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"5967":["Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) F3Q 2013 Results Earnings Call May 30, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - CFO","","Analysts","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Paul [Trestle]","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","Mark Miller - William Blair ","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer ","Jason DeRise - UBS","Bob Drbul - Barclays ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","Operator","At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter FY13 operating results conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, operator. Good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our third quarter operating results for the 12 weeks ended May 12.","As with every call, let me start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. ","To begin with, our 12-week third quarter. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.04 per share, up 18% from last year\u2019s third quarter earnings per share of $0.88. For the third quarter, total sales were up 8%, and our reported comparable sales figure was up 5%.","During the quarter, sales were impacted by both gasoline price deflation and by weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year over year such that the 6% U.S. comp sales increase in Q3, excluding gas deflation, would have been 7%. Our reported international comp figure, assuming flat year over year FX rates, would have been plus 7%. And total company comps, again reported for the quarter, at 5%, excluding both gas deflation and FX impact, would have come in at 7% as well for the quarter. ","In terms of new openings, after opening 14 new locations during the first half of the fiscal year, we opened 5 additional Costcos in the third quarter, two in Japan in Kitakyushu and Hiroshima, and one each in Chihuahua, Mexico; Wheaton, Maryland; and Southampton, U.K.","All told, that puts our fiscal year 2013 openings through the third quarter at 19 new locations, and we now operate 627 Costco warehouses around the world. Between now and September 1, the end of our fiscal year, we expect to open an additional 9 locations, 3 in the U.S., 3 in Japan, and one each in the U.K., Taiwan, and Australia, such that we\u2019ll most likely end the fiscal year with 28 new openings for the year. That\u2019s up from 16 net openings in fiscal \u201912.","Also this morning I\u2019ll review our membership trends, our ecommerce activity, and of course additional discussion about margins and SG&A. For our third quarter, again, sales were up 8% from $21.85 billion last year in the third quarter to $23.55 billion. Again, comps on a reported bases were plus 5. ","Five percent reported comp sales results were a combination of a flat average transaction for the quarter. Of course that included the detriment from both the FX and gasoline, which together represented about 1.5 percentage points and an average shopping frequency increase of about 5.5%. That compares to a fiscal year to date shopping frequency number up about 4.5%. So a pretty strong frequency there.","Cannibalization for the quarter was pretty similar to what it was the prior quarter. That negatively impacted sales by approximately 60 basis points. And given our expansion, I don\u2019t anticipate much change in that.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic regions, all U.S. regions were in the mid to high single digit comp increases, with Texas and the Southeast being the strongest. Internationally, expressed in local currencies, Korea and Taiwan were on the weak end of that range, with Canada and Mexico being the strongest in terms of comp sales increases.","In terms of merchandise categories, in terms of sales by merchandise category for the quarter, for the third quarter, within food and sundries, mostly in the mid single digit range, with deli, beer and wine, and candy being the relative standouts. ","Within hardlines, overall in the high single-digit range. And departments with the strongest results were hardware, lawn and garden, and consumer electronics. Consumer electronics, sales were in the mid to high single digit range for the quarter.","For softlines, up about 10%. Small electrics, housewares, jewelry, and apparel were standouts, with media, as expected, continuing to be on the relatively weak side. And within fresh foods, where comp sales were in the high single-digit range, deli and produce showed a little better results than the other areas.","Moving to the line items of the income statement, membership fees came in at $531 million, up 12%, or $56 million, from last year\u2019s $475 million, also representing about an 8 basis point increase year over year. ","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy the strong renewal rates, and I\u2019ll go through that, continued increasing penetration of the executive membership, and of course, as I\u2019ve mentioned for several quarters now, we\u2019re still benefitting from the $5 and $10 membership fee increases that began in November 2011 in the U.S. and Canada for new signups and in January 2012 for renewals.","Due to deferred accounting treatment for membership fees, of that $56 million increase during Q3, a little over half of it was due to that annual fee increase and how that rolls into the book P&L over about just under a two year period.","And as previously mentioned, membership fee income will continue to benefit from this deferred accounting for that fee increase throughout the fourth quarter of 2013 and to a lesser extent into the first fiscal quarter of 2014 this fall.","New membership signups in Q3, company-wide, were very strong, up 19% year over year. That strong performance is mostly reflective of the very strong signups we\u2019ve had in our Asia openings this past March in Japan.","In terms of number of members at Q3 end, at Q2 end we had 27.8 million gold star members. At Q3 end, 12 weeks later, that was 28.2 million. Primary business went from 6.5 million a quarter ago to 6.6 million. Add ons remained at 3.5 million, and you add those numbers up, at Q2 end we had 37.9 million member households and 38.3 million at the end of the quarter. With the extra spouse card, 69.1 million at Q2 end and 69.9 million at Q3 end.","At May 12, the third quarter end, paid executive memberships were 13.3 million. The vast majority of that, of course, is in the U.S. and Canada. We also offer it now in the U.K. and Mexico. That 13.3 million, by the way, during the 12-week quarter, represented an increase of just under 250,000, or about 21,000 additional paid executive members per week increase.","Executive members are just over a third of our member base, and a little over two-thirds of our sales. On a year over year basis, the percentage of members being executive members was up about 1percentage point, which of course will translate into about a 2 basis point hit on margin with reward.","In terms of renewal rates, they continued strong. Again, going back a quarter ago, business renewal rates were 93.9. At the end of the quarter, they remained at 93.9. Gold star went from 88.8, tweaked up a little bit to 88.9. So total in the U.S. and Canada, these are United States and Canada numbers, was 89.8 at the beginning of the quarter, or at the end of last quarter, and tweaked up to 89.9 at the end of the third quarter.","Worldwide, at the end of the second quarter, I mentioned last quarter we were up at 86.5, and that tweaked down one tick to 86.4. Again, when you open new warehouses, you tend to start off with a lower renewal rate, particularly in countries outside the U.S. and Canada. And so that\u2019s to be expected.","Going down the gross margin line, our gross margin in the third quarter was higher year over year by 12 basis points, coming in at a 10.67 in Q3 versus last year\u2019s 10.55. As usually, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We\u2019ll just do the third quarter here. Two columns, reported and without gas deflation. And the line items would be core merchandising. The second line item would be ancillary businesses, the third line item would be 2% reward, the fourth item would be LIFO, the fifth item would be other, and then the total, of course.","So, the two columns, across, the reported core merchandise margin was down 5 basis points, and without gas deflation, down 11. Ancillary businesses were plus 6 and plus 5. Two percent reward was minus 2 in both columns. LIFO was a credit of plus 6 in both columns. And other, which is a nonrecurring lawsuit recovery, which benefited margins this quarter by 7 basis points, so plus 7 and plus 7. ","If you add the two columns up, the first column, of course reported, comes up to the plus 12 basis points that we reported. And without gas deflation, plus 5. The core merchandise component, again, was minus 5 on a reported basis and a minus 11, excluding the benefit of gas deflation. ","The four core categories, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods, each showed lower year over year gross margin percents as we continue to invest in price, both in our domestic and in our international operations. And as I\u2019ve stated before, this is Costco playing offense. It\u2019s driving sales, member shopping frequency, member signups and renewals, and market share.","Ancillary business gross margin, as I mentioned, was up 6 or 5 without gas deflation, basis points. Margins were stronger in the one-hour photo mini labs, the optical, and the hearing aids. Slightly lower in pharmacy and gas was slightly positive.","The impact, as I mentioned earlier, on the executive membership increased penetration was minus 2 basis points. And as I mentioned, LIFO, the year over year is a 6 basis point swing. Basically we recorded an 8 million or 3 basis point pretax credit during this quarter. And lastly, other, as I mentioned, that\u2019s a nonrecurring legal settlement that we received in Q3.","Moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q3 over Q3 were lower or better by a reported 3 basis points, coming in at a 982 this year versus the 985. And again, the two columns, reported and then without the gas deflation, and five line items: core operations, central, RSUs, quarterly adjustment, and total.","In terms of core operations, the reported piece was plus 2 basis points. Without gas, it would have been plus 7. And plus means lower or better. And so we had 7 basis points of positive there. Central was plus 2 and plus 2. RSUs was minus 1 and 0. ","Quarterly adjustments, actually, was 0 and 0, such that total, we reported a plus 3, SG&A lower by 3 basis points. Again, in our view, on a more normalized basis it would have been lower by 9 basis points if you exclude the fact of gas deflation.","And a little editorial on SG&A, again, the reported 3, excluding inflation, would have been better by 9. The core operations component was better or lower by 2 year over year, and again 7 excluding gas deflation. ","Within core, our payroll as a percent of sales improved year over year by 4 basis points. Total payroll dollars actually increased about 6.5% in the quarter compared to the 8% total sales increase. ","This is due to an improvement in payroll. We were able to leverage benefits, including healthcare and worker\u2019s comp. They were leveraged during the quarter by a few basis points. Actual healthcare costs in the U.S., which is the key driver of this area, eased a little bit, up around 6% in dollars during the quarter. That\u2019s down from low double-digits in the past couple of quarters.","Our central expenses, as I just mentioned, was better or lower by 2 basis points. That\u2019s, by the way, notwithstanding the fact that the ongoing IT modernization costs, which I talked about in the last few quarters. During the quarter that represented about a hit to SG&A, or higher SG&A, of about 5 basis points. So notwithstanding that impact of minus 5, in the central category, we still showed a lower by 2 there.","So overall, I think, pretty good expense control and certainly helped by strong sales results as well. Next on the income statement, pre-opening: $6 million last year, and $10 million this year. We opened four net openings last year in Q3 and five this year. All told, operating income in the third quarter was up $100 million, or 16%, from $623 million last year to $722 million this year.","Below the operating income income line, reported interest expense was $6 million higher year over year in the quarter, coming in at $25 million versus $19 million a year ago. If you recall, last year on March 15, until a little over a month into the fiscal quarter, we paid off a $900 million fixed rate 5.4% interest debt. This represented about a $4 million reduction in interest expense year over year in the quarter.","Offsetting that $4 million reduction, of course, was our December offering of a $3.5 billion debt offering in late November, of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of just under 1.25%. For the 12 weeks, that\u2019s about a $10 million increase, of course, in interest expense. The [full] reduction and the 10 increases [unintelligible] net increase that we\u2019re talking about here.","Interest income and other was lower year over year by $3 million, coming in at $15 million this year versus $18 million a year ago. About two-thirds of that $3 million delta is actual interest income being lower this year, coming in at $9 million this year compared to $11 million last year. And other rounded to the last million, both relatively similar numbers within the interest income and other line.","Overall, pretax earnings were up $90 million, or 14% from $622 million last year in the quarter to $712 million this year. In terms of our income tax rate, very close to being the same in both third fiscal quarters, 34.81% this year, down just a tick from 34.84% last year. So essentially the same year over year.","Overall net income was up 19% from $386 million last year to $459 million last year. While the balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, a couple of items I usually point out. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $221 million, and that brings year to date for the three quarters to $651 million.","If you look at the balance sheet, of course, if you look at accounts payable as a percentage of inventories, on a reported basis it was 104% a year ago and 102% at Q3 end. That includes payables for things other than merchandise, most particularly all the construction and expansion activity we\u2019ve got going on. So if you look at just merchandise payables to actual inventories, it was 92% last year and a tick down at 91% this year.","In terms of average inventory per warehouse, I think in the last several quarters on a year over year basis, we\u2019ve generally shown numbers in the $600,000 to $700,000 increase range, or 5-7%. This quarter, on a year over year basis, it was up $400,000 or 3%, coming on an average $12.2 million versus $11.8 million a year ago.","Just over half of the $400,000 increase related to higher levels of merchandise in food and sundries, scattered among various subdepartments. About $100,000 was consumer electronics, with the balance spread over a variety of other non-foods departments. Overall, inventory is in good shape. As well, our mid-year physical inventories, which were taken back in January and February, were our best ever, so we continue to do well, in our view, in terms of inventory control and how that relates to operations safety as well.","In terms of capex, in Q1 we spent $488 million. In Q2, $455 million. And the quarter just ended, $435 million. So to date, at just under $1.4 billion. Our estimate for the year is right at $2 billion, and that of course compares to fiscal \u201912 expenditures and capex of $1.5 billion, and of course reflects the fact that we\u2019re opening quite a few more units than we did a year ago. ","In terms of Costco Online, we currently operate Costco ecommerce activities in the U.S., Canada, and more recently in the U.K. For the third quarter, sales and profits were up nicely over the last year. Q3 ecommerce sales were up over 20%, both in the U.S. and Canada and, as I mentioned, Costco U.K., which started less than a year ago.","In terms of expansion, as you\u2019ll recall, in the last two full fiscal years, in \u201911 we opened 20 net new units. In \u201912, 16. To date, for the first three quarters this year, 19, and our plans are to open 9 in the quarter. That would put us at 28 for the year. So, as compared to fiscal \u201912\u2019s expansion of about 3% in square footage growth, this year\u2019s 28 units, on a beginning base of 608 would be about 4.5%.","New locations by country, for the year, of the 28. Assuming the 28, it would be 13 in the U.S. and 3 in Canada, 3 in the U.K., 7 in Asia, one in Taiwan and Korea each, and 5 in Japan. And then as well, one additional unit in Australia and one in Mexico. As of Q3 end, our total square footage was 89.709 billion square feet, so again an increase of about 4.5% year over year. ","In terms of common stock repurchases, as you know we purchased a small amount in Q1, about $34 million worth, and that\u2019s all the activity we\u2019ve done so far. We did no additional repurchases in the second and third quarter. ","In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.31 a share. That was recently increased about a month ago. Up 13% from the previous $0.275 a share. This annualized number of $1.24 per share represents a total cost to the company of about $550 million a year.","These quarterly dividends, of course, are in addition to the $7 per share special dividend, which totaled just over $3 billion that we paid out to shareholders back in December of 2012 or in the second quarter. ","The usual supplemental information will be posted on the Costco investor relations site later this morning. Lastly, our scheduled earnings for Q4, which is the 16-week quarter that ends September 1, is currently planned for Wednesday, October 9. And again, that will be for the 16-week fourth quarter ending September 1. Mind you, last year was a 53-week year, and therefore a 17-week fiscal fourth quarter. So that was about 6% more days in the quarter, if you will.","With that, I will turn it back to the operator and be happy to answer any questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] You have a question from Deborah Weinswig.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","Can you talk about your frequency, which was obviously very strong in the quarter, on an absolute and relative basis? Can you talk about any unique drivers behind that?","Richard Galanti ","Not really. We\u2019re not doing anything different other than continuing to be aggressive on pricing. And if you haven\u2019t tried our rotisserie chicken, that\u2019s the new hot dog in terms of $4.99 chickens. There\u2019s not been a lot of difference year over year in any of the [MVM] mailers, the coupon mailers. So not really.","We certainly are getting our share of free press out there, whether it\u2019s the late night talk shows or the morning business shows. But that\u2019s all anecdotal, of course. There\u2019s nothing specific that we have done different of late.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And then can you also discuss your [unintelligible] network as it stands right now?","Richard Galanti ","You know, in talking to the buyers, there\u2019s not a lot of anticipatory inflation with the exception of some aspects of protein. They continue to see inflation in some of those items, beef, poultry, and pork. Some of what we call limited resource commodities like nuts, because of increased world demand, with the increasing middle class, if you will, those have spiked up. With those few exceptions, there\u2019s not a lot. ","I think to date, if you used as your benchmark the LIFO calculation, which uses what our U.S. inventories, by item at cost, were and how those costs have changed from the beginning of the year to now, again, an ever so slight credit in each of this quarter and last quarter. I think together, if 100.00% was the base as of the beginning of the fiscal year, as of Q3 end, it was 99.41%, so 0.06 of a percent lower cost inflation. Now, again, that\u2019s one measurement that\u2019s easy to look at, because it\u2019s basically our U.S. LIFO inventory counts. ","But that wasn\u2019t that discernibly different than a quarter ago. But we don\u2019t really see a whole lot of trend upward beyond those small areas that I mentioned. I think gas is always, who the heck knows.","Deborah Weinswig - Citigroup ","And then on the executive membership side, which has obviously been incredibly successful in the U.S., beyond Canada, the U.K., and Mexico, how should we think about the growth there?","Richard Galanti ","Well, we continue to look at it in all countries. I think we seem to like it, it works for us. Generally speaking, we like to have a core number of locations there and start off with some small number, but more than one of two, of services that we can provide under the executive member format. So the number of services where the executive members, in some cases, get a better deal on some of those services. ","So, you know, I would guess over time we\u2019ll continue to roll it out to other countries. I mean, again, the 13.3 million, all but about 400,000 of that are in the U.S. and Canada, which of course is roughly 80% of our company in terms of sales or locations or what have you, and well over 95% of the executive member base. But that\u2019s because it started here. ","Operator","Your next question comes from John Heinbockel.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","The price investments, is there more of a skew toward consumables, or no, it\u2019s more broad-based than that?","Richard Galanti ","It\u2019s more broad-based than that. Given just the sheer volume of items, what we need to make sure is we don\u2019t want to spread it out. You\u2019ve got to be \u201cwow\u201d if you will, on items, and not just spread it across all categories and all items. And so we try to do a pretty good job of that. But it\u2019s spread among categories. I, a little tongue in cheek, talked about the chicken. I mean, as protein prices go up, our costs go up, and we\u2019ve been very successful, we think, in driving sales and if we can get you to go to the back of the location and get that great chicken for $4.99, you\u2019re going to shop doing other things. So it\u2019s across the board.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","So no matter what department you\u2019re talking about, the idea here is not so much where you can get your costs down, but where you can make a clear impression on the customer perception-wise?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Ultimately, it\u2019s an art form, and it\u2019s merchandising, and it\u2019s just across the board. Sometimes we work with vendors, and sometimes we rotate items in and out. It\u2019s not unlike what we do, historically, on the fence or endcaps. You\u2019re always going to see us try to create some excitement as you walk down those larger aisles, down the main aisles.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Do you think the price gap has changed, or widened, versus your various competitors, or no, it\u2019s about what it was?","Richard Galanti ","I think it\u2019s been pretty similar over the last few years. We don\u2019t see any dramatic change in it. If anything, we tend to sincerely play offense and irrespective of what\u2019s going on out there. I mean, you\u2019re always going to see, be it our direct competitors such as Sam\u2019s and BJ\u2019s, or other category dominant retailers, items and departments. But for the most part, when we do our weekly by location market baskets on key competitive items, those ranges, in our view, of our competitiveness, is pretty similar to what it has been, if not a little higher, a little better.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","More favorable to you? ","Richard Galanti ","Yeah.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Then just two last things. Is there about $30 million left of incremental benefit on the membership fee increase? Is that about the residual number?","Richard Galanti ","It had a 3 in it. It\u2019s a little higher than 30. It starts with a 3.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","And then lastly, when you look at Kirkland, where are you roughly now with SKU count? And do you think, as a percent club SKU count, that inevitably goes higher? And I know you don\u2019t want to force it on people, but obviously you continue to find value-added items. Does that just go higher over time as a percent of total SKU count?","Richard Galanti ","Yes, absolutely. I think it\u2019s still in the low to lower mid 20s, but it keeps going up incrementally. Part of that is the increased penetration of some of those items overseas, where whatever extreme value we are, it\u2019s even more extreme on those kinds of things. We have items that do $2,000 and $4,000 a pallet position in the U.S. that do 5 and 10 times that in some of the Asian countries, simply because it\u2019s a great value on great stuff. And we can be even more extreme over there versus brands. ","So yeah, we continue to look at different areas, and in this past year, I know we\u2019ve put it on some women\u2019s exercise apparel, active wear, which has been very successful. I know we have several men\u2019s summer items, whether it\u2019s shorts, performance polo shirts. And so it\u2019s food and non-food. I don\u2019t see any discussion of putting it on a television or anything anytime soon. But certainly there\u2019s a lot of categories. You know, all the low-lying fruit, paper goods, water, those are all done. But probably the lowest lying fruit in the last few years was probably the disposable diapers. ","But there\u2019s lots of things, it always amazes me when individual food items, the cashew clusters or something innocuous like that, is a $15 million item and $25 million and $30 million a year later. All of a sudden you\u2019ve got those types of things out there. So, you know, I think it will scale slowly through the 20s and upward, but it\u2019s not like we have a concerted effort to try to get to a number by next year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul [Trestle].","Paul [Trestle]","","Just with the price investments, you\u2019ve had a very consistent message over the past few years in terms of Costco being on the offensive in terms of making consistent pricing investments. So should we look at the core being down this period compared to being more flattish the past two quarters as a signal that this is incremental, that this is, you know, in addition to what you\u2019ve kind of done over the past few periods? Did you go deeper or wider? And how should we think about the next few quarters?","Richard Galanti ","In all honesty, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re that smart about it, strategic about it. I think our strategy is to constantly drive it downward, and the more we can do that, the bigger gap we have with our competitors and the more our traffic grows, and the more our sales grow, and good things happen.","I remember somebody a few years back asking what happens if a month into a fiscal quarter you\u2019re not doing well, what do you do? And we say, we don\u2019t change what we\u2019re doing. I think that given our strength of late, we look at it and say this is a good time. When we look at certain countries where we\u2019re very profitable bottom line, as a percentage of sales, relative to the U.S. and Canada, and Canada a little more than the U.S., we\u2019re our own toughest competitor when things get too good. ","And so again, I can\u2019t suggest that it\u2019s a trend. I think there were three or four quarters prior to the last three quarters, so all of last fiscal year, comparing those quarters to their respective comparable quarters a year earlier, it was down, and we were talking about investing in price. And then the last quarter or two was relatively flat, so does that suggest it\u2019s going to continue to be flat? Well, Q3 says no, it doesn\u2019t. But I don\u2019t think you could use that as a trend line either way. ","We\u2019re going to continue to do things to drive our business, and we\u2019re fortunately in a positive way. We\u2019d rather be aggressive on pricing and see the benefits of SG&A, which always has been a challenge for us. But margins are not a problem. ","Paul [Trestle]","And international is becoming a bigger penetration of your business overall, and currently that segment has a few hundred basis points higher margins than the U.S. Is that sustainable? Or is there any changing dynamics that you see that might alter that?","Richard Galanti ","Meaningfully higher, yes. Is it sustainable at this rate? Probably not. We know ourselves that as we take a $300 million unit in Taiwan or Korea or Japan and put a new unit 10 miles away, we\u2019ll do $450 the next year between the two, but it\u2019s going to hit the P&L for a couple three years. So part of this ramp up overseas is going to impact that a little bit, and as we\u2019ve constantly been reminded, originally by Jim and now you can be assured by Craig, is let\u2019s not have the illusion that we can just continue to be strong numbers. ","Again, I think some of what you saw was a little bit of margin reduction year over year this quarter. There was a little more so internationally, and part of that is the things I mentioned, a little bit of the increased expansion and sitting in the meetings, saying guys, these numbers are growing pretty fast, let\u2019s make sure we\u2019re giving back price, in terms of price. So it\u2019s our doing. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Sandra Barker.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","I just wanted to clarify, on the price investment internationally, don\u2019t you have less competition there? I\u2019m just wondering, I would imagine as you talk about the extreme value on some of the private label, I would think you already had a very large price gap versus the competition. And I had another question also.","Richard Galanti ","We do, but again, if you look at a company that has a pretax return on sales in the three-ish range, very high twos or three, or whatever it is now, and then you look at that U.S. column and extrapolate from the operating percentages, that it\u2019s in the low to mid twos in the U.S., better in Canada, and a lot better in other countries, we\u2019re very good at looking at something and saying, guys, we\u2019re making too much here. And so we want to keep driving it in the right direction.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","And then also, just some illumination on buyback and how you think about that in the future, since it seems to have dwindled away this year.","Richard Galanti ","We look at it as between the regular dividend and the special dividend, and even assuming just the $34 million in stock buyback this year, we\u2019ve still essentially, between the two, given back a lot of $3.5 billion to shareholders this year, virtually almost all in the form of dividends. But we look at both, and over a longer period of time we would expect to continue to buy back stock as well. But, again, we don\u2019t suggest it\u2019s going to be a certain number. Clearly, given the relative strength and, importantly, the fact that we did the special dividend, we don\u2019t feel any exterior pressure to just do it on a regular basis. We\u2019ll continue to do that over a period of time, though","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","And any commentary on any impact from Target in Canada?","Richard Galanti ","Really, no. And without disrespect, there\u2019s really not been, in our view\u2026 Now, our margins in Canada have come down, and again, that\u2019s more us than that. Certainly, as I\u2019ve mentioned over the last year and a half, we\u2019ve been preemptive knowing that they\u2019re coming in. But we also have had very strong numbers. Our local currency comps up there are in the very low double digits in local currency. So it\u2019s a strong economy. ","We\u2019re doing very well, and again, it\u2019s one of those things where Craig in the budget meeting says guys, let\u2019s not close our eyes and turn around one day and find out that we\u2019re not special, and let\u2019s get pricing back where it needs to be. And what that means is we\u2019re making good money up here, it\u2019s growing well, so let\u2019s make our competitive posture stronger. But a lot of it has to do with us, not really a lot of promotional pricing issues from what\u2019s going on with them. Keep in mind that they haven\u2019t opened a lot of units yet either. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Feldman. ","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","So just wanted to drill down on inventory again. I know you had mentioned you feel like you\u2019re in pretty decrease shape with inventory, but are there areas where you could be adding more or maybe where you\u2019re actually missing a sale because of not having the right product? Or just the opportunities within inventory management, I guess, and assortment planning? ","Richard Galanti ","Well, again it\u2019s part science and a lot of art form. As you probably know, over the last 10 years, we have consciously reduced our active SKU count in our warehouses from 4,100-4,200 down to 3, 700-3,800. And that\u2019s, in our view, driven sales because we could double [mass out] something versus taking out an item and replacing it with more of the other item. In that double space you will do more than you would have done with two items. So it\u2019s always that intelligent loss of sales. ","I can only tell you that in the 26 days a year that we spend in a budget meeting, a third of which is merchandising discussions, and part of the operations discussions are also merchandising discussions, I hear many more comments from Craig and others when we have too many of something. You know, five varieties of cordless phones, or whatever it might be. So if anything, we continue to look to see how we can reduce our selection a little bit.","Now, we\u2019re also mindful it\u2019s the buyer\u2019s and the operator\u2019s responsibility, as they\u2019re visiting competition, to identify what they perceive as hot items. Not only at Sam\u2019s, but at other forms of retail, be it Home Depot or category dominant retailers or specialty retailers. And so we\u2019re constantly trying to figure out what we\u2019re missing. Generally, it\u2019s more the opposite though. What do we have too much of, too much selection of? ","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group ","About the traffic trend, which has just been so strong for so long, I guess I\u2019m curious, how do you sustain it? Because people are coming in, it seems, at a pretty frequent pace, 4-5% every month, and it\u2019s better than grocery, it\u2019s better than most anybody else out there right now. And is it just the fact that you have a membership fee, so people feel like, well, I may as well get my money\u2019s worth and go to Costco? How you sustain it? I know it\u2019s a tougher, bigger-picture question, but just any thoughts on that?","Richard Galanti ","Well, first of all, this is one person\u2019s view here, but I certainly believe that two big things that have occurred over the last four or five years in this bad economy is gas prices and the fact that 10-11% of our sales are gas, and that clearly drives people into the parking lot. And 30 or so of every 100 that pump gas go to shop. Clearly, even if one of those 30 is incremental, that\u2019s good, aside from having a profitable gas operation.","The other is fresh foods. All the statistics I\u2019ve read is that when the economy got hammered, people ate out less, not just the steak houses for business travel, but families with neighborhood restaurants. While it\u2019s come back, it\u2019s not back to where it originally was, and clearly our strength in fresh foods, I think, has helped a lot. That, again, is a driver, in my view, of more frequency.","But I get back to the mission of constantly coming up with wow items and getting brands that refuse to sell us to sell us, and diverting more of stuff when they won\u2019t want to sell us if we can get it. All those things are what we\u2019re about, and again, I\u2019m probably a little biased, and my antennae are a little stronger in looking, but it seems like every day there\u2019s something on television about us, whether it\u2019s a national talk show or a news item or a late night talk show, you name it. All that stuff, I think, is reinforcing.","The last thing, of course, is the ramp up and expansion outside the U.S. and Canada, our most mature markets. Clearly you have higher frequency numbers in newer markets. So that\u2019s got to help a little bit too. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s as big a factor, because it\u2019s still a small percentage of how many total units we have. I think the bigger factors are that constant lowering of price, and the gas and the fresh foods.","And look, we\u2019ve all seen what\u2019s happened of late with some of the relative strength in companies like Home Depot and Lowes and the housing market. I think I mentioned some of the category areas where we\u2019ve been strong. So we get a little benefit there as well. But that frequency has got to be more that. ","I have no illusions that it can sustain itself. Seemingly for 20 years prior to late \u201908, on average the number was in the 1-1.5% range, and ranged generally from minus 1 to plus 2, with the exception of a couple of outliers based how Easter or July 4 or something falls year over year. So we\u2019re in uncharted territories. ","I remember a year and a half into this recession, after having maybe a 4 for all of calendar \u201909, reminding people that if we\u2019re zero in 2010, that\u2019s still a 2 and a 2 for 2 years, and not ever thinking we could accomplish what we have. And so we\u2019ve certainly benefited by our model and perhaps by the demographic of our member and by the other things I just mentioned.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Horvers.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan "," ","Wanted to follow up on the international margin side. The ramp in expansion, understanding that your investing in price internationally because you\u2019re more profitable there, and you\u2019re not resting on laurels, and also densifying the base. And that brings down existing profitability, but what\u2019s the other side of it? Does opening up new stores that are inherently more profitable relative to domestic, is that a net positive to margins for the company?","Richard Galanti ","I\u2019d have to honestly pencil it out. Probably a little, but I\u2019m shooting from the hip on that one.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","Okay, I can follow up. And then also, a lot of retailers have talked about pressures from the weather and variability to the weather. You had a great quarter on the traffic side and on the comp side. But did you see much variation around weather? You saw strength in lawn and garden. Do you think it would have been better ex the weather impact, suggesting that maybe there\u2019s some pent up demand here that could flow through?","Richard Galanti","Fortunately, we\u2019re in, I think 41 or 42 states and Puerto Rico in the U.S., if you will, and so when the weather was bad in one part of the country, it wasn\u2019t bad in the other part of the country. I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but I know over the last few months, when the regions got up and spoke, some of the regions had incredible strength when expected in seasonal items like seasonal clothing and seasonal patio furniture and what have you, whereas other regions it came a little later. I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me, but if there\u2019s a little pent up demand, it\u2019s in a few of the regions, and some of it\u2019s already happened in the third quarter. So maybe there\u2019s a little bit there, but I don\u2019t see a whole lot of that.","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","Is that, in a similar vein, that the high exposure to California buffered your weather sensitivity?","Richard Galanti ","Again, all the eight regions in the U.S. were pretty good. But they were actually at the low end of that range of I think I said mid to high single. It was still positive, but no. ","Chris Horvers - JPMorgan ","You mentioned about healthcare costs up 6% year over year versus low double-digit in the past quarters. What\u2019s changing there? Are you doing something? Is this in anticipation of Obamacare next year and that\u2019s blowing through early? And what\u2019s the outlook there?","Richard Galanti ","You know, I wish I knew. For the 12-week quarters, when I looked each week at what we pay out in U.S. healthcare costs, which is the thing that drives that line item, it, generally speaking, was pretty consistent, in the mid, little higher, single digits. And so we didn\u2019t have any outliers. Sometimes when you see a week or two that\u2019s a 3% or 5% increase year over year, the next week\u2019s 12% or 14%. And so the average was still 10% or whatever ex is. ","And there\u2019s not a lot of new things we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re doing a couple of little things, but nothing that would have driven this. We\u2019re hopeful that it will continue, but we still budgeted up a little higher than Q3.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Binder.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","First, any early view on how real estate is lining up for next fiscal year? Secondly, you commented on the seasonal business being lumpy. Was there any kind of gross margin hit related to seasonal businesses in the quarter?","Richard Galanti ","Nothing out of the ordinary, on the latter question. And what was the first question? Real estate, yeah. Our forecast right now is right at that 30 number, with half or probably a little over half of it outside the U.S.","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","And of that 30 number, how many re secured or definitely going to fall into the year versus what might still be at risk?","Richard Galanti ","I think there\u2019s more than 30 on the list, and you kind of just use a little guestimate by location, and we come up with a number that\u2019s close to 30. So it\u2019s a little too early to tell. If you asked me for a range, I\u2019d probably say three less and five more than 30, so 27 to 35, but I\u2019m guessing here. But 30\u2019s probably a good number. ","Dan Binder - Jefferies & Company ","And on membership fee growth, recognizing, due to the accrual accounting the tail end of benefit that you\u2019re getting from the membership fee increase, when we take that into account and the one less week in the quarter, any color you can provide from the impact of those two things versus the 11.8% growth rate that you were at here in Q3?","Richard Galanti ","I think you can say, yeah the deferred accounting over the last three quarters, the number\u2019s in the 6-7% range probably in dollars. And when we look at Q4 last year, 17 weeks versus 16, one seventeenth is about 6 percentage points. So I don\u2019t have any Q4 estimates in front of me, but just those two simple math items would tell me that anything at or slightly above zero would be expected. But I haven\u2019t looked at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Miller.","Mark Miller - William Blair ","I think you said payroll was up 6-plus percent in the quarter, and so if your dollar per hour wage increase is I think around 3%, that\u2019s implying your hours worked per club would be flattish. Is that correct? And if so, how are you managing that with the mid single digit traffic increase? I know you\u2019ve got a signature change you put in with Amex, but what are the other key initiatives that are helping here?","Richard Galanti ","Cutting overtime I think has helped a little bit. I\u2019ve used the word focus before. I\u2019ve also talked about, when people asked me a year ago, what\u2019s different about Craig? I mean, it\u2019s not a question of what\u2019s different about Craig versus Jim, but Craig would say himself his strength is he grew up in operations. So I think there\u2019s focus on that. SKU count management, going from X to a lower number means you\u2019re [unintelligible] out more stuff. I think it\u2019s all the little things. You commented on the signatures being captured. Certainly yes, can that shave of seconds in a transaction? All those things help. But a lot of it is the pallet presentations and what we do.","Mark Miller - William Blair ","And then can you give us some perspective on your efforts to get global pricing terms with suppliers? Are you getting traction on this? In the numbers it doesn\u2019t necessarily look like we\u2019re seeing it yet.","Richard Galanti ","Yes, we are getting traction. It\u2019s still not material to the size of our company. But again, every month, when the country heads from each country are here for two days, part of their presentation, and part of their offsite additional meetings with our merchants here, is getting, on a global basis, our buyers here to work with multinational vendors to make sure we\u2019re getting better pricing. And in some cases, better availability of certain items. It\u2019s a process.","Mark Miller - William Blair ","What was the one-time legal settlement?","Richard Galanti ","I can\u2019t say what it is, but it\u2019s a few year period of time where we picked up money that totaled about 7 basis points in the quarter. It was good, but it\u2019s nonrecurring.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nagel.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer ","I wanted to focus on unit growth. A couple of questions. Someone asked you about the number for next year, and it sounds like you\u2019re intending to open new units at a pace next year that\u2019s consistent with this year. The question I have is what\u2019s allowing you now to more rapidly open units? Has something changed in the marketplace? Or was it a decision internally to do it? And as we look at beyond just this year and next year, is the company committed to continuing to open new units at a kind of longer term pace consistent with what we\u2019ve seen this year?","Richard Galanti ","To answer the last question first, yes. We\u2019ve got literally more real estate people on the ground in more countries. The pipeline has taken time to fill up, but it\u2019s filled up. If you look back a few years ago when we had, just as an example in Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, 6 or 7 units in each of Korea, Taiwan, and maybe 8 or 9 in Japan, we\u2019ve ramped that up. ","And so we\u2019re going from opening, between those three countries a few years ago opening up a couple of units a year between the three countries, to opening up 5-8 between those three countries a year. But again, that\u2019s partly that conscious effort, both in the real estate area under Jeff [Bratman] and his people and Craig also pushing that. Yesterday and today, they\u2019re both out looking at sites in different parts of the country. "," ","Our goal over the next five years, I think I\u2019ve said, is about 150 buildings. And if we get a little better than that, great. But that\u2019s certainly a good starting point given where we\u2019ve come over the last few years.","Brian Nagel - Oppenheimer ","The unit growth numbers didn\u2019t hit your targets, or maybe what investors were thinking, and now you\u2019re showing a faster growth. So it sounds to me like you\u2019ve kind of made the internal decision to grow faster. To any extent is it a competitive response? Are you seeing a need to jump out in front of a competitor? Or is it just internal decisions?","Richard Galanti ","Sometimes it\u2019s competitive only from the standpoint that as we look at our success in other countries. We have a competitor in Korea. We recognize that. We\u2019re successful in several countries where we\u2019re the only one, and we want to do more of that. ","We think that if you look back at the history of Canada, there was a competitor there that chose to not stay there. And I can remember the time when we had probably 55 or 60 units in Canada, thought one day we might have 75. Now we have in the high 80s, and we think we can get to a little over 100. So we\u2019ll keep doing that to drive our business. ","So mostly it\u2019s not a reaction to others, it\u2019s a reaction that we\u2019re doing well and we want to keep ramping it up a little bit. And yeah, the decision to ramp up, as an example, internationally, given there is a longer timeline to get a unit open many times, was really made two or three years ago, and it\u2019s now coming to fruition this year. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Jason DeRise.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Wanted to ask a bit more about the membership fees. Could you maybe share about how the membership grew without FX for this quarter, an organic number? And then if you could talk about how membership grew internationally versus U.S., that would be helpful. ","Richard Galanti ","Again, I think of the $56 million or whatever number increase, a little over half of it was the deferred accounting. And I think it was a 12% dollar increase, so that would imply about a 6% rounded dollar increase ex that deferred accounting. Overseas, I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me. My guess is that it\u2019s higher in local currency, but it was a little lower because of the fact that on average, on a weighted average, foreign currencies weaken relative to the dollar, so when you convert everything to report in U.S. dollars, it was actually a slight negative. ","So you just made a light bulb go off. Actually, the underlying number, ex deferred accounting, in local currency probably would have been a little better, but again, the numbers we speak about when we show the membership income was including the detriment of weaker FX.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","Right, the FX would be similar to the FX you see on your net sales, is that right?","Richard Galanti ","Yeah.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","And then I guess understanding the members from another point of view in terms of the traffic, obviously you give an all-in number. Do you have how international traffic is actually doing versus the U.S.? I know you alluded to that it\u2019s been good.","Richard Galanti ","It\u2019s actually very similar to the U.S. But we\u2019re not going to go down the road of detailing it, because I always find as I try to put more out there then I\u2019ve got to give it for the rest of my life.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","Obviously, U.S. fee increases are very invisible to most of the investor base, but what\u2019s happening elsewhere in the world in terms of fee increases? And anything in the pipeline there?","Richard Galanti ","We\u2019re driving the business. Historically, we\u2019ve shown that we\u2019re prepared, and we will increase fees, but we\u2019ll take that one step at a time. Again, I don\u2019t want to suggest that we have a plan to do it tomorrow or a year from tomorrow, but I would guess over time you would start to see fees continue to go up. But then recognize what we do. When we have increased fees we get more competitive. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Bob Drbul.","Bob Drbul - Barclays ","Over the next several years, I know you talked about like 150 clubs. How many do you think you can have in the U.S. and how many of those clubs would you expect to be in the U.S. of the 150?","Richard Galanti ","I think on our cheat sheet from last year it was 55 out of 150 were in the U.S. And my guess is it will be a little bit more than that. And if we open what we say we\u2019re going to open this quarter, we will end the fiscal year with 636 units, of which 452 would be in the U.S. And if you add 50 or 55 to that, you\u2019re at 505 or 510. And my guess is the five years after that, it\u2019s not 50 more, but it\u2019s 20 to 30 more, who knows?","So I think what we have found over almost 30 years, and what I assume we\u2019ll continue to find, is we\u2019ll always end up opening a few more than we thought were possible.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sean.","Sean","I guess on the international front, you talked about Mexico a little bit, and that does sound like one of the strengths in the international business. Can you just give us a little bit of an update on that business and how that market is performing? And is there an opportunity to grow a little bit more aggressively in this market, and how the productivity is doing in those boxes?","Richard Galanti ","For the five years up to when we acquired the remaining 50%, last July, I think in the five years we opened a total of three units, so less than one a year. I think this year we\u2019re opening one. And my guess is that will quickly go to two to four, who knows? But we\u2019ll wrap it up. Keep in mind, we have 32 or 33 units there. Sam\u2019s has well over 100, and we think there\u2019s plenty of opportunity there. It\u2019s very profitable. And expressed in dollars, its average unit does about half the dollar volume because of just the relative currencies. ","But it\u2019s growing nicely. Its bottom line is much stronger than the company as a whole. But so are a few other countries, in terms of the bottom line with a much stronger top line. So Mexico\u2019s great. It\u2019s been a healthy growth for us, and if anything, for unrelated reasons we hadn\u2019t grown a lot for those four or five years, and we\u2019re starting to invest more now.","Sean","And I guess from a category perspective, consumer electronics has been an area of strength. I think it inflected about maybe 12 months ago. And it sounds like the inventory is up a little bit on a per-warehouse basis. I guess can you talk about the strength, kind of what\u2019s driving that in this category? And then is the opportunity still there moving forward? And then is this an increase in the SKU, or is this more ASP related?","Richard Galanti ","Yes, and yes, and yes. There\u2019s a little bit more presence out there. We have done very well not only within TVs, but higher end TVs, the 60 and 80-inch TVs and the smart TVs. We\u2019ve also done well on a much smaller scale dollar-wise, on cellphones. And doing much better in things like tablets, because we\u2019re selling some. We\u2019ve got all but one of the main brands names out there, and those are really starting to pick up for us. But you know, TVs dwarf everything else, just in sheer dollar volume. And again, they were up low double-digits this month. And I think in the last year have probably been up on average in the mid to high single-digits in dollars.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Benedict.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird "," ","Just back to the traffic question, can you give us a sense of maybe which member group is driving more of that traffic, if there is a difference? Is it the business member or the gold star member? Is there anything discernible there?","Richard Galanti ","It\u2019s executive. If you put it in simple sequence order, you\u2019ve got your regular gold star, you\u2019ve got your regular business, you\u2019ve got your executive of either of those categories, and then the triple play, if you will, would be you\u2019ve got the executive business member with the cobranded Amex card. All those things lend itself toward higher frequency and higher total purchases. But executive members clearly a driver.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","And then onto the SG&A, the 5 basis point headwind that you called out from the IT modernization efforts. How does that compare to the last few quarters? I don\u2019t know if you can quantify the impact, but just wondering if that\u2019s kind of typical, if that\u2019s what it\u2019s been running. And how long do you think it will persist, and when do you think we start to see some payback from those investments.","Richard Galanti ","I think it\u2019s been probably a range of 4 to 6, but it\u2019s been pretty similar over the last few quarters. I think that will still be incrementally up over the next four quarters, but probably not 5, lower than that. And then hopefully it will subside a little bit. And hopefully then you get some benefit from it as well from more efficient operations, whatever we\u2019re putting out from it. But for those of you who have known us for a long time, we pride ourselves on keeping things simple. ","And we are basically a legacy shop. We wrote our own GL years ago. And so this is new for us, and it\u2019s taking a lot of effort, and for us, a lot of money. Fortunately it\u2019s divided by a lot of sales of dollars. So 5 basis points is still a lot this year. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 2 or 3 next year, but it\u2019s going to be lower than 5 is my guess. And that will then not be a discussion topic in terms of SG&A basis points.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","And then just on the clubs left in the U.S., what do the markets look like that you\u2019re going to, the next 50 or 80 or so Costcos in the United States? How are they different than your existing footprint? Is there certain regions where you\u2019re going? Or is it different types formats, malls, etc.?","Richard Galanti ","Quick back of the envelope guess would be half of it\u2019s in strong, existing markets and then half of it\u2019s in newer markets. I\u2019m just looking at the opening schedule this past year. It\u2019s been everything from another unit in Washington, DC and Maryland in the U.S., to one last fall in Huntington Beach, California, which is clearly in-fill, to several units in the Dallas and other Texas markets, which I would say have gone from new markets to very clearly good in-fill markets. In Chicago as well, in-fill. To markets like Knoxville, Tennessee, New Orleans, Louisiana. So a combination of both. Baxter, Minnesota. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s an in-fill or an extension of Minneapolis. Just off the top of my head. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Melich.","Greg Melich - ISI Group "," ","Wanted to follow up on the inflation in the quarter, or lack thereof. If I\u2019ve got it right, gas and FX was 100-150 basis points, so ex those, ticket was up 1-1.5. How does that break down? Was there any inflation? Or was it all just items in the basket and mix that actually got some basket growth?","Richard Galanti ","Very little inflation. ","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","I\u2019m saying with LIFO gain, there might have been a little deflation, and maybe items in the basket or mix helped a couple hundred basis points.","Richard Galanti ","[unintelligible] LIFO deflation, just from as of the beginning or the end of last fiscal year, not just this quarter. But yeah, literally it\u2019s a couple of basis points on our LIFO inventories in the U.S. So very little deflation, other than gas.","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","What behavior have you seen with the dotcom sales up 20%? Who\u2019s driving that? Is it a small group of members that are using it a lot more? Or do you find that a lot of your members are trying the online site?","Richard Galanti ","I think it\u2019s a little of both. We\u2019re still doing it the old fashioned way, and some would say the stubborn way. We are doing a few more things. Clearly replatforming, the dotcom people feel that\u2019s helped. Mobile has helped a little. The apps are driving people to it. I forget what percentage of the total sales are coming on apps. It\u2019s small, but it\u2019s growing. And again, we don\u2019t do a lot of stuff. Our MVMs probably, in our view, have had as much effect as anything, when we have some of those exclusive online-only MVM coupons in the physical mailers. Social network is up. We\u2019re getting the name out there a little more. It\u2019s nice to see some increases that didn\u2019t have one digit or a one in front of it, two digit. ","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","And then lastly, on the cash flow, even with the capex up, do we still expect free cash flow to be around $1.5 billion, even with capex up this year? Can payables actually get to inventory? And then also, is it still the plan to buy back enough stock to make sure that there\u2019s no option dilution. Now that you did the big special dividend, how are you thinking about that?","Richard Galanti ","Clearly the special dividend had some impact on that. Clearly the very ramp up in strength in our valuation. But our view is we\u2019re still, on average, a stock buyer over time. We don\u2019t feel pressure that we\u2019ve got to do a certain amount by a certain date. In terms of cash flow, you take your estimates for net income, take depreciation up, the 9% or 10% it\u2019s up. Regular dividends, pretty close to what our 8-year average is, about 13%, or whatever. Your regular dividend is about 550 a year. ","And assuming capex went from the $1.5 billion to the $2.0 billion, you\u2019re going to cash flow a little higher than you suggested. But that assumes no stock buyback. And we\u2019ll see. I would hope, and I can\u2019t say expect, because we don\u2019t look at it that formally every day, but over a period of time, we clearly want to cover our issue dilution, but we don\u2019t feel compelled that we have to do it by year-end for this year. ","Getting to 100 is tough. Seasonally, it gets over 100, sure, but I think on average it\u2019s probably 94-95 during the year. Maybe 93-94. And one of the things that happens, particularly in this low interest rate environment, and particularly since we have a lot of cash, we\u2019ll offer vendors, particularly medium sized vendors that might need to clean up a balance sheet at quarter end for certain covenants, we\u2019re being pretty aggressive on what will you give us if we pay you a little early on something? Outside the regular terms. These are not big numbers, but you turn around and its hundreds of millions of dollars. ","I\u2019m not sure if it ever gets to 100 unless the turn goes from the 12-13 up to 15 or something, and that\u2019s going to be tough. But we\u2019ll keep working at it. ","Greg Melich - ISI Group ","And how does international affect that payables? Maybe look at merchandise payables inventory? Does that sort of force it down a little bit? ","Richard Galanti ","I think it\u2019s higher volumes, but I think the payables percentage is a little lower in some of the countries. But part of that is timing, you know. Of a bunch that you ship to Asia, if 25-35% of our sales over there are U.S. sourced goods, and with the exception of probably fresh food items that have to be airfreighted, a lot of that stuff could be on two-week plus containers. Sometimes you\u2019re able to negotiate with a vendor to socialize that, and sometimes you\u2019re not. ","I think I mentioned it was 91 for the quarter, merchandise payables, and that 91 there were two countries that were over 100 outside the U.S., and there were two countries that were below 80, and one in the 80s and a couple in the 90s. Of course, the U.S. and Canada are on average a shade above the 91 average. And us is right on it, so it\u2019s a little bit all over the board. I would guess Australia would be near the lower end, and that\u2019s because it\u2019s the longest place to ship goods by sea. ","Operator","You have a follow up question from Sandra Barker.","Sandra Barker - Montag & Caldwell ","I don\u2019t want to beat a dead horse about the price investment, but I just wanted to clarify, can you explain the mix of the price investment and how much of it is going toward international versus the U.S.? Because I know in the U.S. you had a fee increase, and that would be sort of a logical assumption that you\u2019d be offsetting that there, but if it\u2019s more skewed toward international, is this a different philosophy than you\u2019ve had in the past? And how are you sure that you get back more than you\u2019re giving up if you are the only club in a country, or if you\u2019re still sort of new and you have a ton of traffic already? I\u2019m just trying to understand the philosophy there.","Richard Galanti ","You know, every action has a different reason. Sometimes it\u2019s emotional, and it\u2019s what we do for a living. Sometimes it\u2019s, certainly as you just suggested, given our membership fee strength in the U.S. and Canada, that allows us to be more competitive in other areas, and certainly that\u2019s part of it. Given our strength and profitability in some countries, that gives us an opportunity to be more aggressive on certain things. ","So I do want to emphasize, it\u2019s not as scientific or as analytically thoughtful, but we know when sales are going in the right direction, we can be more aggressive, and we choose to be. And it has worked for us. ","And so I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t shed more light on it. If I look at the core businesses, I think probably the one that was least impacted was the U.S. this last quarter. But if you look at all the other countries, every country has a different reason. And it\u2019s not every country, it\u2019s all over the board. And sometimes it\u2019s on hot items, sometimes we\u2019re trying to build something. ","Okay, well thank you very much, and happy to take any calls. Bob, Jeff, and I. "],"5969":["Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) F1Q 2014 Results Earnings Call December 11, 2013 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - CFO","","Analysts","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital ","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Jason DeRise - UBS ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research ","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee ","Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse ","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James ","Operator","Good morning. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead sir. ","Richard Galanti","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter earnings results for the 12 weeks ended November 24.","As with every conference call, I\u2019ll start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. ","To begin with, for the quarter our reported earnings came in at $0.96 a share, compared to last year\u2019s earnings per share of $0.95. Several items of note that impacted the year over year comparison. I\u2019ll go through six items. ","Membership fee increase, as I\u2019ve been mentioning for the last many quarters, the fee increase that we did in the U.S. and Canada in late 2011 and early 2012, that benefited this first quarter earnings by about $8 million pretax, or $0.01 a share. That will be the tail end of the benefit of that increase showing in our numbers.","Interest expense was higher year over year in the first quarter by $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share. This of course related to last December\u2019s $3.5 billion debt offering in conjunction with the $7 per share special dividend.","FX, in the first quarter the foreign currencies we operate in weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan. This resulted in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars, being lower by about $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share than those earnings would have been, had FX exchange rates been flat year over year. ","Gasoline profits, gas is a very good business for us. It drives frequency, we feel, and year over year it\u2019s always profitable, although it tends to be volatile. And the first quarter that impacted earnings by a little over $0.02 a share.","Stock expense, that\u2019s a line item that we have in our SG&A, it was higher year over year in the first quarter by a little over $0.02 a share as well. We have over 4,000 people, generally managers and buyers and above, who receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation. ","Such grants are made annually each October, or in our first fiscal quarter. These RSU grants then typically vest over a five-year period, with accelerated vesting when a recipient reaches 25, 30, and 35 years of employment with the company.","Now, factors driving this increase included a 24% increase year over year in our stock price on the dates in which the RSUs are granted each year, additional levels of accelerated vesting given many employees\u2019 long tenure with the company, and a large number of employees in the plan. ","I should note that this past October, our RSU grants were reduced by an average of around 15%. That is, the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. The increased expense occurred, of course, notwithstanding that reduction.","IT modernization, talk again about that. We\u2019re in our probably second full year of a major modernization effort. And as discussed in the past several quarters, these efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages throughout fiscal 2014 and probably a little beyond that, especially as the new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year over year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by about $12 million or about 3 basis points. ","Turning to our sales for the first quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figures for the first quarter showed a 3% increase, 3% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding a gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 3% reported U.S. comp would have been 4% for the quarter. The 1% international would have been up 6%, and the over 3% for the company would have been plus 5% on a basis excluding gas deflation and FX.","Other topics of interest, opening activities and plans, we opened 13 locations during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, 9 throughout the U.S., 1 in Alberta, Canada, 1 in Monterey, Mexico, our third in that city, and 2 new units in Australia, bringing Australia now to 5 total units in operation. ","During the fiscal quarter, one location was closed, in Acapulco, Mexico. This was due to the extensive damage that resulted from the severe flooding down there from Tropical Storm Manuel. That may or may not reopen this fiscal year, but most likely certainly in calendar \u201914. ","Since the end of the first quarter, we have opened in Q2 two new locations, one in Illinois and one in Canada, in Ontario. That gives us 15 new openings thus far in fiscal 2014. For the entire fiscal year, we have a current plan of 30 new locations, 16 of which are planned for the U.S., 4 in Australia, including the two we recently opened, 3 in Canada, 2 each in Korea, Japan, and Spain - and of course those would be our first two units in Spain - and one additional location in Mexico.","I\u2019ll also discuss later in the call ecommerce activities, membership trends, and of course a discussion on the components of margin and SG&A.","Again, quarterly results, total sales were up 5% to $24.5 billion. On a comp basis, a reported 3, which again, excluding gas deflation and FX, was a 5 on a normalized basis. In terms of the 3% reported comp, that was a combination of an average transaction decrease of 2%, actually up almost 1% excluding deflation and FX, and an average frequency increase of just under 4.5% for the quarter.","In terms of sales comparisons geographically, for the first quarter, the better performing regions in the U.S. were in the Southeast, Midwest, and Texas. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing countries were Canada, Mexico, and Australia.","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, within food and sundries, candy, deli, and refrigerated were the relative standouts. Hardlines was probably the most challenging category. Majors came in negative for the quarter, challenging of course in televisions and in cameras. And better-performing departments within the hardlines were office and automotive, but slightly negative overall for the department.","Within the low double digit softlines positive comps, small electrics, apparel, and jewelry were the relative standouts. And within fresh foods, comps in the mid singles. Better performing departments included produce, meat, and deli.","Moving down the line items of the income statement, in the first quarter, membership fee income came in at $549 million or 2.24% of sales. That\u2019s 7.3% or a $38 million increase versus the first quarter of last year, and as a percentage of sales, up 4 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, that did include the extra $8 million, the first time that incremental benefit from the fee increase we did almost two years ago. ","In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates. A little over 90% in Canada and the U.S., and just under 87% worldwide, continued increased penetration of the executive members, and of course the benefit I just mentioned, from the fee increase.","Our new membership signups in the first quarter companywide were up 17%. That\u2019s of course due to the fact that we opened 13 units this year in the first quarter versus 9 a year ago, and this year\u2019s first quarter included three international openings, which tend to have higher signups at opening.","In terms of number of members at Q1 end, Gold Star members came in at the end of the first quarter at 29.6 million, up from 28.9 million 12 weeks earlier, at the end of the fiscal year; Primary Business at 6.7 million, up from 6.6 million 12 weeks ago; Business Add On at 3.5 million each. ","So, total total member households, which, at the end of the fiscal year had been at 39 million even, came in at the end of the first quarter at 39.8 million. So, all told, we have 72.5 million card holders out there at the end of the first quarter, from 71.2 million at fiscal year-end.","In terms of paid Executive members, they stood at 13.9 million of those totals, an increase of about 330,000 during the quarter, or a little over 27,000 new Executive members per week increase. They represent about 35% of our member base now, and over two-thirds of our sales.","In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they\u2019ve continued to be strong. Our total membership eked up a little bit from 90.0 at the end of fiscal year to 90.2 worldwide, and worldwide from an 86.3 to an 86.5.","Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margins were up 13 basis points, up to 10.81%. As usual, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down four columns and six line items. Basically, the first two columns would be reported for the entire fiscal year of \u201913, and then the second column would be also for the entire year fiscal \u201913, but without gas. And then for the first quarter, columns three and four would be reported and then without gas deflation.","Going down the lines, the core merchandise year over year, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, other, and total. So again, going across, core merchandising for the fiscal year, fiscal \u201913 versus fiscal \u201912 was lower by 4 basis points in both of those columns. Ancillary businesses was better in the fiscal \u201913, plus 6, in both of those columns. 2% Reward, minus 2 in both columns. LIFO, plus 5 basis points in both columns. Other, plus 2 in both columns. That was a nonrecurring legal settlement, which benefited our margins last year. And the total fiscal \u201913 over fiscal \u201912 was up 7 basis points, both on a reported basis and without gas.","For the first quarter, merchandise core reported was up 12, but without gas deflation up 3. Ancillary, up 5, but without gas, plus 2. 2% Reward, minus 3 and minus 2. LIFO, minus 1 and minus 1. Other, zero and zero. So again, total reported for the first quarter year over year and the first quarter was 13 basis points up, but taking out gas, deflation was up 2 basis points.","Now, the core margin, in terms of core merchandising the component gross margin being up again 12, but 3 excluding gas. Both food and sundries and hardline subcategories were up in basis points year over year, while softlines was down slightly year over year and fresh foods had lower year over year gross margins as well.","Ancillary business gross margins were up, as I mentioned, 2 basis points without gas. Ecommerce, business centers, and pharmacy also showed higher margins year over year, offsetting slightly lower gas margins. ","Our 2% Reward, again increasing sales penetration in that, and therefore increasing Executive member rewards, caused a 2 basis point year over year reduction in margin, due to the reward program. And LIFO, last year in the quarter we had a $2 million LIFO credit. This year, there was a very small LIFO charge of about $1 million, so about a 1 basis point swing year over year. ","Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the first quarter was higher or worse by 17 basis points, coming in at 10.22% this year in the first quarter, compared to 10.05% last year in the first quarter. Again, we\u2019ll do the same four columns, reported for all of fiscal \u201913 and then without gas, and then columns three and four reported for the first quarter year over year and then without gas for the first quarter year over year. ","In terms of operations, in the fiscal year both columns are the same, columns one and two, zero and zero for operations; central, zero and zero; RSUs, or stock compensation, minus 3 and minus 3; quarterly adjustment, plus 2 and plus 2, for a total in fiscal \u201913 SG&A was higher by 1 basis point or minus 1 year over year.","Columns three and four, operations on a reported basis was 9 basis points of that 17, minus 9. Without gas, zero. Central, minus 3 and minus 2. Stock or RSU compensation, minus 5 and minus 5. No quarterly adjustments. And then again total minus 17 or 17 basis points higher year over year in the first quarter. And again, without gas, minus 7.","Now, core operations, again, was flat, excluding the impact of gas deflation. Within operations, our payroll SG&A percentage was actually 2 basis points better year over year, while benefits, workers comp, and related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year over year. So those are the two big factors within SG&A [unintelligible].","Central expense was higher year over year, 2 basis points without gas, again primarily related to the increased IT spending as we continue our modernization efforts. This, as I said, will continue to be a drag on SG&A, especially as the new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins.","And finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation, as I mentioned earlier, I won\u2019t go through the detail again, was 5 basis points year over year.","In terms of preopening, $6 million higher, coming in at $24 million in the first quarter. Last year, in the first quarter, we had nine openings. As I mentioned, we had 13 opening this year, so no real surprises there.","All told, reported operating income in the first quarter totaled $639 million last year and was up to $668 million this year, an increase of $29 million. And I won\u2019t go through the items I mentioned earlier.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher versus last year, coming in at $27 million, up $14 million from last year\u2019s $13 million in the quarter. That\u2019s essentially the $3.5 billion debt offering we did and the interest expense associated with that. We did that, I believe, in mid-December, so there will be a little bit of a year over year negative impact in Q2, and then there will be no delta year over year.","Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter, coming in last year at $20 million, and this year at $18 million. Actual interest income component was slightly up, while the other component was slightly down, nothing of size to mention.","Overall, pretax income was up from $646 million last year in the first quarter to $659 this year. Below pretax, our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 34.6%, or about 0.2% better or lower than last year\u2019s rate of 34.8%. I think most of it relates to the various discrete items that impact each year, and so a little bit of an improvement there.","Overall, net income was up $416 million last year to $425 million this year in the first quarter.","Quick rundown of other topics. Our balance sheet, of course, is included in today\u2019s press release. In terms of depreciation and amortization for the first quarter, it was $231 million. One of the metrics we always talk about is our accounts payable as a percent of inventory. On a reported basis, last year it was 108%. This year, in the first quarter, it was 99%. ","Now, both of those numbers include quite a bit of non-merchandise payables, particularly as we ramp up expansion, so construction payables, if you will. If you just look at merchandise accounts payable to inventories, last year\u2019s 108 was a 94, and this year\u2019s 99 was an 89. I\u2019ll talk about that in a moment, why that came down a little.","Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter was $13.2 million. This year, in the first quarter, it was up $1.2 million to $14.5 million, or up about 9%. Both of those AP ratios and the higher inventories is, for the most part, because of how Thanksgiving fell one week later in the calendar this year. So the first week of Q2 versus last year it was the last week of Q1. Much of that excess has since been burned off, and talking to the senior merchants, their view is no issues with inventory levels going into the last few weeks, before calendar year end.","In terms of capex, for the quarter it was $572 million. Capex is estimated to be about $2.4 billion this year, compared to $2.1 billion last year, the higher year over year spend, of course, due to the increased level of planned openings. ","In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend remained at $0.31 a share or $1.24 on an annualized basis. Based on shares outstanding, that\u2019s about a $540 million annual expenditure. ","Costco Online, we\u2019re now in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K., and most recently Mexico. Mexico ecommerce commenced operations in late October. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 ecommerce sales were up 24%. And excluding, again, the relative recent smaller startups in the U.K. and Mexico, U.S. and Canada, the quarter was up 22%.","And ecommerce still is a relatively small part of our company, running about 2.5% of our total sales. We\u2019ve got a variety of initiatives in that area. We\u2019re always asked those questions, so I\u2019ll point out a couple of things. Of course, a year and a half ago, we replatformed the site, and shortly thereafter, added mobile apps. ","We\u2019ve combined, in the last year, some ecommerce merchandising efforts, within line efforts. We think that\u2019s given us a better merchandise capability there. We\u2019ve added a few categories, most particularly apparel, some apparel items. And we\u2019ve done, I think, a better job of improving the timing of shipments by expanding the various shipping points, getting merchandise more quickly to our members.","In terms of expansion, last year we opened 26 units and started fiscal \u201913 a quarter ago at 608 units and ended at 634. So it was up a lot of 4% square footage growth. This year, assuming we get to the 30 net units, on a base of 634 that would round up to about 5% square footage growth. Now, again, if we get to 30, and we expect to, 16 in the U.S., 4 in Australia, 3 in Canada, 2 each in Korea, Japan, and Spain, and one in Mexico.","Square footage at Q1 end totaled 92,654,000 square feet.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for Q&A, and I\u2019ll put myself on speaker phone here. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","On gross margin by category, can you give a little color? Two were up, two were down. I know mix might be some of the explanation, say hardline\u2019s up maybe because majors and TVs down. But a little more color on that, and are there clear areas where you\u2019re making some price investments in that grouping of four?","Richard Galanti ","Clearly fresh foods is the one I\u2019ve talked about in the past. Fresh food margins year over year in the quarter were down. Frankly, they were down, I think, less. In Q4 it was a bigger down year over year. There are a lot of moving parts, of course, but when I go to the budget meeting each month and hear the merchants talk, certainly fresh foods is an important part. As we go into the seasonal period of September through December, you\u2019re trying to do some hot prices on exciting nonfood items as well, bigger ticket items.","TVs, in my view, has a little bit more to do with SG&A. When you sell a few less thousand dollar price point items, that probably impacts your SG&A a little bit. But I don\u2019t even know how much it moves the needle. It helps, but it\u2019s one of many things.","So we keep doing what we\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big surprises to us in these numbers. If anything, one of the things I mentioned last quarter, when I pointed out fresh foods were, I think, 80 or so basis points lower year over year, and it\u2019s quite a bit less than that delta in the first quarter, part of that was, as we\u2019d maintained some key prices on some very high volume key items like the rotisserie chickens, as some of the underlying costs come down a little from their peak, that helps margin a little bit. ","So I think we haven\u2019t changed what we do necessarily to try to reduce that delta or prove a positive delta, it\u2019s just where it came out. We\u2019re ever diligent in being competitive out there.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","Do you think longer term, over a five to ten year time horizon, that as Kirkland penetration goes up, do you think that gives you much room to get sharper on branded pricing? Or not really excited about, that\u2019s an independent decision?","Richard Galanti ","Honestly, there\u2019s a hundred different independent decisions. That\u2019s part of it, certainly. When we expand Kirkland Signature, it does a lot of things. In many cases, as you suggested, we can get a little bit more margin and provide even greater value to our member. ","As important, in some cases it drives a lower price on the branded item as the branded item loses market share to the private label, which again serves us and our member well. So overall, on an overall basis, probably increasing penetration of KS helps you. I think increasing penetration of our total sales in locations that don\u2019t have a direct warehouse club competitor helps you a little bit in some of these other countries.","As you can see from our segment analysis, certainly it would imply that in Canada, which again has been a very strong economy and good growth for us locally as well, not having a direct warehouse club probably works a little higher margin. Not a lot. I mean, we don\u2019t take great advantage of that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities ","And in terms of expansion, I know every country will have different levels of capacity peoplewise, but when you sort of aggregate it, is there a level - you know, as you do 30 this year, maybe a couple more next year - is there a level where you simply, for people reasons, cannot go beyond that without fearing execution might slip?","Richard Galanti ","For us, long term is two or three years sometimes. I think five years ago, when we were averaging something in the low 20s, our goal was to see, you know, can we get it up to 30. And we feel pretty comfortable, as I indicated in the last few calls, that both this year and over the next three or four years some number in the low to mid 30s we feel pretty good about, hopefully starting at 30 and ending at 35 in a few years.","Beyond that, one would think that we could expand that a little bit if the opportunities still present themselves out there. I don\u2019t think that will be a people issue. We\u2019ve done, as you know, a lot of ramp up in several countries. We\u2019ve gone from 8 to 18, or 9 to 18 units in Japan in the last couple of years. We\u2019re going to go from 3 to 7 or 8 in Australia this year. And we\u2019re adding as fast as we can, it\u2019s harder to do in Taiwan and Korea getting sites, but we\u2019ve got the pipeline full, so hopefully we\u2019ll get a little more there.","And so that strains you a little bit, because you don\u2019t want to move some of those people. If anything, we\u2019ve devoted more people to those areas. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a constraint. I mean, if we did 25 a year four or five years ago, and we\u2019re doing 30-ish plus a year now, and five years from now certainly something north of that, assuming the opportunities out there present themselves is certainly a likelihood.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank","If we kind of strip out the impact of gas, could you just speak more to operating margin performance this quarter in the various segments between U.S. versus Canada and international?","Richard Galanti ","I think the detail will be in the Q. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any big trend changes from most recent year and quarters. In terms of operating profitability as a percentage of sales, Canada is stronger than the U.S. It has had a great economy, it\u2019s been a great business for us. It has no direct warehouse operator. Its healthcare costs, on average, are a little lower. So all those things worked in our favor.","The other column, it generally is more profitable, but again we\u2019re opening a lot of new units, and we\u2019re cannibalizing. Going into Spain, we\u2019ll certainly have not only a little extra preopening, but once we get open, $0.5 a million or $1 million a month just in central over there, with one partial unit for a few months.","So I think those things tend to make that column a little harder to understand, and generally speaking, many of those countries in that other column tend to be higher pretax percent of sales than the U.S.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank ","And then just moving to the U.S., can you just give us an update on the top line trends that you\u2019re seeing in California?","Richard Galanti ","No big differences. The big differences in California were way back when the economy first got hit. Not only California, but Arizona, Las Vegas, and Florida, if I recall correctly. Those were the ones that were hit hardest.","I think California overall is probably a shade lower than the rest of the U.S. But the rest of the U.S. includes, you know, Midwest, Texas, where we\u2019re opening new units, and we\u2019ve been pretty successful in seeing more robust top line sales growth.","Paul Trussell - Deutsche Bank ","And just my last question, can you just remind us and give us, on the expense side, how should we think about some of these investments that you\u2019re making and the impact over the next few quarters?","Richard Galanti ","The one that I pointed out now, for probably the last five fiscal quarters, all the quarters last year plus this first quarter, is IT modernization. We have finally had the courage, I think, a few years ago, to recognize that we had great home-grown systems that were kept together and allowed us to do what we wanted to do, but as we\u2019re becoming more global, and bigger, and getting to a platform and a whole IT infrastructure, that will serve us as we go from hopefully $100 billion to $200 billion in the next many years. ","That\u2019s several hundreds of millions of dollars over three or four years. We\u2019re halfway into it, maybe a little under halfway into it, and so my guess is I\u2019ll be talking to you about a few basis points each quarter year over year and incrementally probably into \u201915, before it starts flattening out and coming down. ","But not only is a lot of that expenditure necessary, there\u2019s dividends, we believe, that will come from it too. In a way, one of the first modernization things we did, even before we called it modernization, was replatforming dotcom a year and a half ago. Again, we had a website, the search engines couldn\u2019t even crawl on it, to give you a simple example. We see the potential there. Still relatively small business to our company, but a very profitable business, so we think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity as we replatform and we rewrite the membership system, the basic buying systems, the [unintelligible] systems. But it\u2019s necessary as well. ","Beyond that, it doesn\u2019t seem like healthcare costs are going to change dramatically in the U.S. As a higher percentage of our total company is from overseas, outside the U.S., for the most part every other country that we operate in, the healthcare related costs are lower as a percentage of sales. I might be wrong on one country, but for the most part that\u2019s correct.","So those are the kinds of things that, again, there\u2019s probably a few structural things that, as non-U.S. sales become a higher percentage of the total company, whether it\u2019s a lack of direct warehouse competition in many of these countries, whether it\u2019s lower healthcare costs as a percentage of sales, in some cases a little higher membership fee percentages as a percentage of sales, maybe in some cases occupancy as a percentage of sales is a little higher, but more than offset by the other things I mentioned. So generally speaking, I think that will tend to help us a little bit, and I try to point that out as we go along here. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital ","You\u2019re talking about international, and you\u2019re going to be opening up a couple of clubs in Spain. Can you talk a little bit about what your strategy is about Europe, and the reason for Spain, and not for France or Italy? Just wondering how you think about that. ","Richard Galanti ","We\u2019ve talked about Spain and France with Spain coming first and France hopefully the following year. So we have a few people on the ground in France, or less than a few. But we\u2019re working towards that. And you know, when we looked at where are we going to go before we decided on those two, there\u2019s various different parts of the world, we felt that we\u2019ve had a place of operations in the U.K. for many years, under a little different format, in terms of how we market to our Gold Star members in the U.K. ","But we always looked at Western Europe as a good opportunity for us. Frankly, the economies over there we feel have allowed us the opportunity to get in and to be welcome. We provide good, high-paying jobs, we\u2019re great competitors, and frankly we see the economy a little better than some of the numbers you just read about unemployment. So we think it was an opportunity for us to get in when historically it was a little harder, and we\u2019ll see where we go from there. But to start with, it will be Spain first, France second, and then we\u2019ll let you know when we do.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital ","And is it fair to say that you are looking at places where people are looking for those unique values? So Germany, where the economy has been stronger, they would be something that would come lower on the list of priorities?","Richard Galanti ","Well, we do better in stronger economies, frankly. I think each country has its own set of challenges compared to the United States. And again, I\u2019m not prepared to talk a lot about some of those other countries at this point, since we\u2019re focused right now on really ramping up the newer countries, like Asia and Australia, as well as what we\u2019re doing in these new two countries over in Europe.","Meredith Adler - Barclays Capital ","And then I have a question about ecommerce. First, I was just wondering, I\u2019m sure you do talk to your members, what kind of feedback do you get from them about how much they want ecommerce to be part of what they get from Costco? And is it discussions with them that have a big influence on what you actually sell online? Or are you trying to test new things or sort of branch out in any way through ecommerce?","Richard Galanti ","We take member comments all the time, both online and in warehouse. Ecommerce is certainly an important component of what\u2019s out there, what\u2019s growing. We recognize we\u2019re a retail competitor. It\u2019s part of the landscape. We\u2019re very much a brick and mortar. You know, 97% plus of our business is in store, not online. What we have done is we looked at it as not trying to offer a million different items for our members. Arguably, we don\u2019t offer a million different items to them in store. We offer less than 4,000. ","And we view it as an extension of that, in some categories, as well as some overlap. We\u2019ve been successful in bigger ticket items, hard to handle items like furniture and televisions. But I think the example I mentioned earlier about apparel, we tried some apparel items several years ago in online, and underwhelmed us and our members. We\u2019re trying some different things now, and it seems to be working. ","But again, ecommerce is a small percent, and a given department like that is a small percent. But we are getting some traction. We want our members to buy everything at Costco, whether it\u2019s in-store or online, and we\u2019ll keep trying some new things.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani from ISI Group. "," ","Michael Montani - ISI Group","Wanted to ask about inflation. It looks like maybe with gasoline in total it could have been slightly down for this quarter. Is that right? And also, what are your buyers seeing out there six, nine months out?","Richard Galanti ","Again, we had a very small LIFO charge. Given the volatility in gas, it was deflationary, although I don\u2019t think we took any of that in the first quarter. We tend to wait into the year. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the past many years. So probably, including gas, yes, it was slightly deflationary, but not reflected in our small LIFO charge.","In terms of outlook, the only thing that I can recall from the budget meetings has to do with some fresh food items or commodities. You know, three months ago, the outlook was three to six months hence, so that would now be three months. Generally speaking, I think that\u2019s still the case, with the exception of some produce items which are more a function of what\u2019s going on with weather in different places. I know there\u2019s been shortages in berries and each of these items are big volumes for us, and that drives the price and availability of these things up.","But overall, I haven\u2019t heard about, from the general nonfood areas, anything big. If I look at the last month, just strolling down the 30 biggest inflationary items, there\u2019s a few on the beef side, there\u2019s several produce, like strawberries is up 25% plus, blueberries up more than that on a cost basis. Then I look on the deflationary side, you have the usual suspects of electronics and gas, of course, as I mentioned earlier. And a few other items that generally are some commodity items that peaked a year ago and come down some. So again, no big inflation raiser this time. ","Michael Montani - ISI Group ","And just a quick follow up on Kirkland. Can you just remind us where the penetration is today, and is it still kind of 50-75 type penetration increases that you\u2019re seeing?","Richard Galanti ","It\u2019s in the 23 plus range. My guess is it\u2019s half a percent. Part of that is that as we roll out gas in Canada, aside from gas deflation right now, as gas from the company has gone from 9 to 10 to 11 to 12 percent, everything else, KS, is increasing relative to that other 87 or 88 percent.","Michael Montani - ISI Group","And then just an ecommerce question, actually, that has somewhat of two parts. If you bear with me, the first part is can you just talk about some of the efforts that you have to sort of integrate your work online with the in store experience, and how there\u2019s interplay there? And then the second one is the AP to inventory ration this quarter obviously came down a little bit. When we look at one of your larger competitors in Amazon, it\u2019s north of 200. So I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s opportunity for initiatives there to really increase that, and if we\u2019ll hear about you guys cohabitating, so to speak, on warehouses with some vendors or anything like that.","Richard Galanti ","First of all, as it relates to Amazon\u2019s enviable 200 basis point, I think a lot of that, as I understand it, for every dollar of reported sales they\u2019ve got close to $0.50 of other throughput, which is not a sale. It doesn\u2019t report on their GAAP income statement, because they\u2019re handling merchandise for others, where they charge service fees for doing that.","In many instances, when that merchandise is sold, it\u2019s sold through Amazon and Amazon gets the money and doesn\u2019t pay those third-party sellers, if you will, until after. And so my understanding is, and I could be wrong, a big chunk of it is that. I would assume, as they handle more inventory that are their sales, that will pressure that number a little bit, but that\u2019s a very enviable number to have. ","In our case, on the other hand, we\u2019ve always kind of looked and said, how can we get to 100%? Can we get no cash required for our inventories? It\u2019s going to fluctuate. This one downturn here has more to do with Thanksgiving than anything. That one week, burning a couple of extra days of sales or incremental equivalents of a day of sales, we get that back in order pretty quickly.","I think that as we\u2019re ramping up expansion, that will tend to reduce the number a little bit. But we\u2019ve always been in the high 80s to very low 100s, depending on which fiscal quarter and timing it is. And I don\u2019t see a lot of change there. Ultimately, if we can turn our inventory faster, it\u2019s going to help that. Gas has helped it in a perverse way. We turn our gas many times a week, many, many times a year. So we\u2019ve got a lot of payables there relative to inventory.","So I think that it\u2019s going to fluctuate a little bit. The only think I wanted to point out in this quarter was Thanksgiving had more to do with the reduction there. I think our inventory turns, our goal is to continue to turn it faster. Ecommerce turns it faster for sure for us, but it\u2019s 2.5% of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","We were hoping you could comment on the buybacks. Specifically, did you guys do any this quarter? And if so, how many shares did you repurchase?","Richard Galanti ","We did not do any this quarter, but stay tuned.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs ","And then just a clarifying item on the stock expense. I guess you mentioned that some of the increase year on year was related to, basically, it was more [tenure]. Is that a trend that continues here going forward? And would you expect additional pressure on that line because of it?","Richard Galanti ","That will continue to have some pressure, recognizing every time a given person hits 25, 30, or in a very few examples 35, that\u2019s going to hit it, although that reduces that amount because it\u2019s the same charge over five years, it just comes sooner. And so it will be bumpy sometimes. When I looked at the four quarters this coming fiscal year, the big hit is in Q1. It dips a little bit in Q2. It dips back up in Q3, and dips a lot in Q4, relative to the increase we saw in Q1. Some of that has to do with the timing of acceleration.","In addition, we\u2019ve always put a lot of compensation focus in most of those people\u2019s cases, or in many of the managers and above, if you will, over half of their annual compensation relates to stock, and hopefully stock price performance.","But we\u2019ve tended to try to keep the number of grants each year to a given person at a given responsibility level the same. This is the first time in many years that we\u2019ve reduced it, recognizing the stock has been very strong, not only this year but several years. ","Now, again, by reducing the grant by an average of around 15% per recipient - and it ranged from zero for lower grants to 20% for our CEO and chairman and board - that will continue to impact us for a few years year, but I think this was a little bit more of an anomaly this quarter and it will be an anomaly in the third quarter and sometimes there will be a little less. But overall, I think it will be a slight increase of the SG&A in each of the next couple of years.","Now, one thing that will reduce it if the stock, next October, is at a price lower than the $117 or $118, but we hope that goes the other way and it\u2019s a little higher expense, so we\u2019ll see. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise from UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","I always get a lot of questions about why you do so well internationally. And so I was wondering if we could get some color on a few specific markets, particularly in Canada and Mexico. And I guess I\u2019m talking about just top line success, and if you can comment at all about how you\u2019re doing with members there?","Richard Galanti ","Canada, first of all, has had a great local economy. It didn\u2019t get hit with the financial crisis that we in the U.S. did. Some of its economy is natural resource based, which has been on a boom for the last couple of years.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","But there\u2019s more competition in Canada too, and when I look at some of your competitors there, it doesn\u2019t sound so rosy, so it\u2019s got to be something else. ","Richard Galanti ","Well, there\u2019s no direct competition, there\u2019s no other warehouse club operator. Mind you, our warehouse club business is roughly at 11% gross margin. Other forms of big box discount ranges everywhere from the very high teens to, in the case of home improvement, to the low to mid 30s. But call it the high teens and low 20s for general merchandise big box discount. And supermarkets, of course, are in the mid-20s and up.","So at 10 or 11, that\u2019s a pretty compelling value proposition, when you don\u2019t have another warehouse operator. So I think that helps us a little bit. We don\u2019t take a lot of advantage of that. We have a little extra margins. In some countries, while our labor cost in every country we view our labor wage rates are at a significant premium to comparable big box hourly retail, they frankly are lower in terms of dollars in some countries. And sometimes the top line purchasing power is not as low. So that helps your percentages there.","And some countries, like Asia, we have a lot more members per warehouse when we start up, so we have a little higher percentage of membership fees as a percentage of sales. Again, on a macro basis, the one thing internationally in some of these countries that stands out a little higher might be occupancy, but we own 80% of our units, so you don\u2019t see that in SG&A, frankly, a lot. You see a little more depreciation perhaps, but you don\u2019t see rent charges.","And so all those things have tended to help, but by and large, in my view the big factor is going to be no direct warehouse competitor.","Jason DeRise - UBS ","And then in Mexico, I guess that\u2019s one that\u2019s every monthly sales call it\u2019s been called out as one of the strengths, and we haven\u2019t seen that many openings from you. You do have a direct competitor there, so maybe talk about what\u2019s working in Mexico.","Richard Galanti ","Well, it\u2019s working very well for us. We have, I think, 33 or 34 units. Sam\u2019s has over 100. They have been much more aggressive over the years. We know saleswise that our units, like the U.S., do more volume per warehouse. ","Until July of 2012, we owned 50% of a venture, and operated it, with a very good partner, Comercial Mexicana, down there. They had some financial issues, and so for I think five years, leading up to July 12, over five years we opened a total of two units down there. We have ramped up our activities and efforts down there. We opened, I think, one this year, but we\u2019ve got plans for more. ","And you\u2019ll see that come up a little bit. We\u2019re not going to go crazy. We\u2019re not going to go from 30 to 40 in a year, but you\u2019ll see that 0.4 number, if you will, two units over five years, increase quite a bit and continue in that direction. ","Jason DeRise - UBS ","And just one more question about some of the new markets. As you thought about Australia, and I guess now Spain, do you think it\u2019s more like a Canadian market, where if you keep your margin structure, in terms of your markups, the same as the U.S. or any other market you compete in, that you think you just come in at a wider gap, and that\u2019s why you picked it, those markets, as the next of the evolution? Or is there something else about where you can source product that you\u2019re bringing back to the U.S.? I guess there\u2019s some less known synergy about shipping to Asia crates of American product and bringing product back that you\u2019re selling in the U.S. ","Richard Galanti","I like to think we\u2019re that smart sometimes. But again, we look at all countries around the world, and where we\u2019re going to go. Australia we viewed, much like we did Alaska and Hawaii 25 years ago, where the margins, and the markups, in those two states were dramatically different than the mainland. And Australia also has a very high price structure. ","As I understand, two retail competitors have upwards of two-thirds of the market share over there. So we came in with our margins, which were even more dramatic over there. But we also look at it as what is the potential. ","Part of our due diligence, if you will, in addition to looking at various metrics like population and small business and average household income, is really shopping the towns, and going over and visiting these places, you know, feet on the ground, all the way from our chairman and CEO to key merchants and operators, and see how vibrant the retail business, and how competitive it is. We think that as we\u2019ve gone into these countries, clearly we are the extreme value proposition in terms of markup. ","Again, when we look at Spain, we think the economy is a little better than some of the numbers would portray in terms of unemployment. But we\u2019re there for the long term also, and the economy should get better over time. But it\u2019s less to do with what products come from there. ","Part of our success, as an example, in Asia and these other countries, is bringing not only Kirkland Signature items but in some cases U.S. sourced goods that aren\u2019t there. And we all think of ourselves sometimes as liking things like Italian leather and cashmere from Europe, and guess what, some of these other countries like big American stuff at great value and prices. So that\u2019s helped us as well. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. ","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","I\u2019d like to focus on the second quarter to date, and how has the sales cadence been trending by week, and how do you feel about the mix thus far as the second quarter has progressed towards Christmas?","Richard Galanti ","Of course, we don\u2019t provide any guidance. Nice try. The only thing we did say, certainly for everybody, not just us, in the U.S., the switch of Thanksgiving a week later certainly impacted November reported sales and the November-ish month of our first quarter. The fact that there\u2019s five less days between Thanksgiving and Christmas, less selling days, that\u2019s certainly going to be an impact for everybody out there. But you know, we plan for it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Just following up on Chuck\u2019s question, and kind of getting your take on the sales climate, aside from the one less week that you talked about, a number of companies have seen their sales slow post-Labor Day, and you guys have been somewhat immune to the slowdown, although that did change a little in November. Was that due in part to the one less week, as you just mentioned, or is there anything else going on that you could comment on?","Richard Galanti ","There\u2019s not a whole lot we see. Not really. We\u2019ve commented on the slower TV sales. It was very strong a year ago. I think there\u2019s a little less promotion out there. But there\u2019s really not a whole lot beyond that. Frequency continues to be strong.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research ","And then just following up on that, it sounded like last quarter, if my memory serves correctly, that you\u2019d be willing to keep some margin if prices fell more quickly, as you maintain your competitive pricing in areas such as food. Has anything changed in the competitive landscape over the last couple of months, or what you see over the next few months that could mitigate your ability to capture some of that margin if it\u2019s available?","Richard Galanti ","First of all, separate sales and margin. We don\u2019t really see a whole lot of change in the landscape, other than a few retailers opened earlier into Thanksgiving this year. We don\u2019t really see a whole lot out there different. There\u2019s certainly more promotional stuff that we all read about each day that some of the power retailers are doing, and [onto the] merchants.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee ","Just a quick follow up on an earlier question. You guys mentioned no buybacks in the quarter, and haven\u2019t had any since Q1 \u201913 it looks like. Could you just maybe talk a little bit about the strategy to return cash to shareholders with regard to the various vehicles that are available to you, whether it be another special dividend or increasing the ongoing dividend, or starting to buy back more shares aggressively going forward?","Richard Galanti ","Well, again, it\u2019s more art form than science here. We still view our outlook and our opportunities going forward positively. First and foremost is to ramp up expansion, which we have done, although we\u2019re generating more cash than that. We have historically, for now eight or nine years, raised our dividend every spring, I believe. We of course did a big special cash dividend, a little over $3 billion, last December. ","And I think you\u2019ll see all of the above. We haven\u2019t looked beyond where we are now. We\u2019re not sitting around looking at special dividends as an example. I\u2019m sure next spring the board will consider what they want to do with the regular dividend, and again, I don\u2019t want to be coy, but we\u2019ll continue to look at stock buybacks and let you know next quarter what we did or didn\u2019t do. But we view all those vehicles as logical vehicles for us going forward.  ","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee ","And then just wondering if you could perhaps provide some perspective on the U.S. consumer right now. The general retail environment seems to be more promotional this holiday season, while your approach has always kind of been more in terms of offering everyday value. So I\u2019m just wondering what you\u2019re seeing out of the consumer in terms of his or her appetite for even more competitive pricing, and do you think the generally more promotional environment is affecting your business at all materially?","Richard Galanti ","We do not think it\u2019s affecting us materially. I mean, the fact is that when there\u2019s a lot of promotions, they work. If some traditional merchants are backed up in inventory, they\u2019re going to be very much more promotional. I think as evidenced by our frequency, we still have them coming in, and we have them coming in a surprisingly continued increase year over year. ","Now, that being said, if they stopped at these promotions first, that\u2019s one less thing they may buy at Costco. But we feel very good about our merchandising and our own merchandise marketing activities as it relates to the MBM, some hot buys. We think that we\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on. Again, in talking to the senior merchants, we feel quite good about coming out of the season with nothing unusual in terms of markdowns and having clean inventory. So I think that\u2019s, in my view, good evidence that we\u2019re not seeing a big impact out there. ","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee ","And then just one more, if I may. Can you provide an update, and maybe some flavor, on the progress of some of your newer merchandising initiatives, whether it be in organics or upscaling of fresh foods and cosmetics, or improved assortment in apparel? Any color there would be appreciated. ","Richard Galanti ","I think you mentioned two or three of the ones that would be at the top of the list. Certainly we\u2019ve talked about apparel now for a year, year and a half, and having still double digit increases year over year, two years out. Part of that is our own commitment to expanded apparel. Part of that is from brands. Part of that is the Kirkland Signature. We\u2019ve got a great Italian wool men\u2019s pant that\u2019s $49, actually $39 right now, and we\u2019ve gone from 100,000 to 1 million pair in the last few years. We\u2019re massing that up better. ","Cosmetics, we\u2019ve got a couple of units in the L.A. market where we\u2019re testing some expanded cosmetics. We still would like to get more brands to sell us, but we\u2019re pretty scrappy, we\u2019re getting a few things in ourselves. But it\u2019s still a small business for us.","The ticket programs, whether it\u2019s for movies or for ski vacations or local restaurants, those continue to grow. So again, probably one good thing over the last year or so is some of these nonfood categories, from apparel to domestics to housewares. Those have had some good legs for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Exstein from Credit Suisse.","Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse","Thank you for the update on ecommerce. Could we sort of shift to another part of ecommerce? Amazon announced today that they\u2019re going to start home delivery of grocery in the Bay Area. Where are you in sort of thinking about what you do with the grocery business as new threats come into it, and how do you look at that new form of competition?","Richard Galanti ","We\u2019ll keep looking at it. We have no plans currently to deliver to homes anything other than through ecommerce, which tends to be nonfood items, and very limited foodstuffs, and surely not fresh foods. We enjoy watching the landscape as others are getting into those types of businesses. Some of the supermarket chains, Walmart. ","You know, Google is doing something in the Bay Area as a test with a number of brick and mortar retailers, including us, where they\u2019ll deliver through the Google Mall. They come in and buy it. We do some help in store at just a couple of locations, as a test, but it\u2019s small, and it\u2019s a test. ","So I think there\u2019s going to be a lot of changes over time. You know, getting overnight delivery or same-day delivery is great, but ultimately you\u2019ve got to pay for it, and we\u2019ll see. I think there\u2019s probably a market for it, but we\u2019ll see how big that market is. We keep doing what we\u2019re doing in terms of value. If things change dramatically out there, we\u2019ll figure it out, but there\u2019s a long way to go there first. ","Michael Exstein - Credit Suisse ","Has your business in grocery in Seattle, where Amazon has been most established, been any different overall than elsewhere in the country?","Richard Galanti ","No.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","Just wanted to follow up on Michael\u2019s question there, on the online business. Clearly you guys have a lot of good momentum here. In terms of just fulfillment as it relates to online orders, it sounds like you guys aren\u2019t interested in delivering to homes. But just curious where you stand in terms of developing capabilities such as buy online, pick up in store. Is that something we should expect within the next few years? Or are these types of flexibility fulfillment capabilities just not really important to your core customer?","Richard Galanti ","Well, a lot of what online is is delivering to home, but it\u2019s delivering televisions and swing sets and furniture and some apparel, again, a very limited amount of shelf stable, if you will, food items. And then we also do office products and things online to small business. ","But you know, look, 97.5% of our business is in store. It\u2019s continuing to grow nicely. People actually do like to go out and shop. And when I\u2019ve been asked the question before, on Amazon Fresh, up here in Seattle, or some other type of fresh delivery in other parts of the country, in New York, what have you, my sense is that probably that\u2019s taking some market share more from what are the other daily or every other day alternatives when you\u2019re stopping at the supermarket two and a half, three times a week? Again, on an incremental basis, is there something you\u2019re going to get that way that you didn\u2019t get at Costco? ","But if we can keep you coming in, you\u2019re still getting a lot of key bulk items at our place on the fresh food side as well. And our most loyal members are still getting some of those things at supermarkets and other forms of convenience. And Amazon will be just one of those, or other forms of overnight or other delivery. ","You know, it\u2019s different value. Again, we recognize convenience is a value. I think both Amazon and some of these others out there, the quality tends to be good, the availability sometimes is good or not, but you\u2019re paying for that convenience, and there\u2019s a lot of things that people are still going to buy at our place, and if we can keep you coming in, then we\u2019ll get our share of that.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird ","And just a question on traffic. I think you said up 4.5% in the quarter. It\u2019s been pretty consistently healthy. Is there any material difference you guys are seeing between U.S. frequency versus the trend internationally?","Richard Galanti ","It\u2019s pretty much the same. It\u2019s a little higher in new markets. If you asked me what\u2019s the most surprising, it\u2019s that the U.S. is pretty darn close to the rest of the world. Canada is a little higher than that, and again, as evidenced by a local currency comp in the mid to high singles.","And by the way, some of the frequency numbers change. Like, as we cannibalize, as we go in two years from roughly 9 to 18 units in Japan and add 2 or 3 more units in Tokyo, that\u2019s going to cannibalize and reduce the frequency of that existing unit.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James and Associates.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James ","My questions kind of go back to international, and I\u2019m curious if you could shed some light on what other countries similar to Spain exhibit attractive characteristics that you may look to get into in the future?","Richard Galanti ","It will be a while, and if I knew, I wouldn\u2019t tell you. [laughter] ","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James ","So moving on to my follow up, where do you see the international business going as a percentage of total sales eventually, and the exposure to currency fluctuations as a result?","Richard Galanti ","Well, I think it\u2019s going to continue to increase. Five years ago, 80% of our unit openings were in the U.S., or 75%. This year 50-55% will be U.S. Over the next three or four years, probably a shade under 50, maybe 40-45% perhaps. So I think over time it will continue to increase. ","I think the U.S. will still be above 50%. It\u2019s now around 70%, low 70s. But that will change over time, and again, the relative profitability of these other countries tends to be a little higher than the U.S., so the profitability penetration will probably get there a little earlier. ","And in terms of currencies, arguably we tend to have a currency in the U.S. that on average tends to be stronger over long periods of time than others. So that will impact us, but we\u2019ll let you know what that impact is. That will be part of our makeup.","Operator","There are no further audio questions.","Richard Galanti ","Thank you, everyone. Have a good day. "],"5965":["Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) Q1 2013 Earnings Call December 12, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard A.

Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Trey Schorgl","Operator","Good morning. My name is Felicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Operating Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you, Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.","Richard A. Galanti","Thank you, Felicia. Good morning. Today, of course, is our first quarter earnings report for the 12 weeks ended November 25. As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that these discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, our 12-week first quarter operating results for the quarter. Our reported earnings per share came in at $0.95 compared to last year's first quarter of $0.73. As was noted in this morning's release, there were 2 onetime items that hit last year's Q1 results. The first of these was the settlement of an income tax audit at Costco Mexico last year in the first quarter. During that quarter, Costco Mexico recorded an after-tax charge of $24 million. The impact to Costco's net income, as a then 50% owner of Costco Mexico, was $12 million or $0.03 a share.","The second item that hit last year's earnings results was a $17 million or $0.04 per share charge to SG&A line for our contributions to the Washington State I-1183 Liquor Initiative. Excluding these 2 onetime items from last year's results, last year\u2019s $0.73 reported figure would have been $0.79, making this year's $0.95 figure a 20% year-over-year increase. In terms of sales for the first quarter, our 12-week reported comparable sales figures in Q1 showed a 7% increase, 7% in the U.S. and reported; and 9%, internationally.","Excluding gas price inflation and the impact of FX, the 7% U.S. comp reported number would have been 6%. The 9% reported international comp would have been 7%, and the 7% overall would have been a 6%.","Other topics of interest, I'll talk about our opening schedule first. We opened 9 locations during the first fiscal quarter of 2013, 8 in the U.S. and 1 in Alberta, Canada. By the end of this week, we will have opened in the second quarter 5 additional locations: one in Washington, D.C.; one additional one in Canada; one in the U.K. and one in Korea, which is later this week, giving us 14 new openings thus far in fiscal 2013.","For all of '13, we have a current plan of 30 new locations: 14 of which are planned for the U.S.; 3 each in Canada and the U.K.; one in Australia, which will be our fourth in that country; a new one in Mexico, our 33rd location and the first new opening in Mexico in a little over 3 years; and 8 in Asia, including 5 in Japan, 2 in Korea and 1 in Taiwan.","Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margins and SG&A in the first quarter, stock repurchase activities, which were relatively small, and of course the 2 subsequent events, the announcement of a $7 per share special dividend, which will be payable on December 18 and the sale of $3.5 billion of senior notes.","Okay, on to the discussion of the quarter. Again very briefly, the sales for the year or the 12 weeks ended November 25 were $23.2 billion, up 9.6% from last year's first quarter of $21.2 billion. On a reported comp basis, first quarter comps were up 7% for the quarter; and excluding gas and FX, up 6%. Again comprised of a 6% U.S. without gas and 7% international in local currencies. For the quarter, our 7% reported comp result was a combination of an average transaction increase of about 2.5% and an average frequency increase of just under 5%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geography, geographically, all the regions have been fairly consistent for the past few fiscal quarters, generally in the mid to high-single digit positive range. One outlier was due to Hurricane Sandy hitting the Northeast. Comps for the Northeast region in November were lower than it had been running by a couple of percentage points.","California has been in the mid singles positive range. Southeast and midwest in the mid to high singles. Internationally in local currencies during the quarter, Costco Canada continued strong coming in, in the low double digits for Q1 and in the mid to high singles in November. Where international sales results are being hit as in Asia, in a word, cannibalization. Since Q1 ended a year ago, we've opened one unit in Korea. We now have 8 there; one unit in Taiwan, which brings us to 9; and 4 new locations in Japan, so we now have 13 in Japan. So 6 new openings in the past year on a base a year ago of 24. And additionally in Korea, a few months ago we, like other big-box retailers in Korea, are now required to be closed 2 Sundays a month.","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, September, October, November essentially, within food and sundries overall in the 4 to 6 range; with candy, deli and refrigerated being the relative standouts.","Our hardline sales were quite a bit stronger as compared to recent quarters. Majors electronics came in, in the high teens and hardware in the mid-teens. Overall, in the low double digits for hardlines. Within the low double-digit softlines comps, small electrics and women's apparel were the standouts, with media being the area of continued weakness. And within Fresh Foods, its comps had been in the mid to high-single digit range; also categories, pretty good results.","Moving down the income statement. In the first quarter, membership fees $511 million or 2.20%. That's up 14% or 9 basis points from the $447 million a year ago or $64 million increase. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from several things. Certainly, we're still benefiting from the $5 and $10 membership fee increases that began last November in the U.S. and Canada for new sign-ups and this past January for renewals. Of the $64 million increase year-over-year in membership fee income, about $28 million we estimate was due to these increases based on how deferred accounting works.","The income statement benefit to the membership income line, as I mentioned before, will continue to show year-over-year -- incremental year-over-year increases throughout the 4 fiscal quarters of 2013 and to a partial extent, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. In addition, we've got new openings that have helped, as well as strong renewal rates rounding up to 90% in the U.S. and Canada and 86% worldwide and continued increasing penetration of the $110 year executive membership in the U.S. and Canada.","Our new membership sign-ups in first quarter, company-wide, kept pace year-over-year with last year's sign-ups. While we did have more locations opened in the quarter, 9 versus a year ago of 4, we figure it's a pretty good outcome given that there were very strong international openings last year, which contributed to very large sign-ups in Q1 a year ago.","In terms of new members for Q1 end, at fiscal year end, we had 26.7 million gold star members. That's up to 27.3 million at Q1 end. Some of that, of course, is the conversion of some of our business add-ons as they converted to executive member to become their own separate membership.","So again, 26.7 million became 27.3 million. Primary business, 6.4 million at year end and 6.5 million at Q1 end. Business add-on, 3.8 and down to 3.6. Again, that's related to that conversion. And so all told, 36.9 million and now 37.4 million. Including add-on spouse cards, 67.4 million cardholders at the end of Q4 and 68.2 million cardholders 12 weeks later at Q1 end. At Q1 end, paid Executive Members were 12.9 million, an increase of 280,000 or about 23,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive Members account for a little over 1\/3 of our membership and a little over 2\/3 of our sales. That trend continues as well.","In terms of renewal rates, they continued strong at 89.7% at Q1 end in U.S. and Canada; and 86.4% worldwide. Business was a 93.6 at Q4 end and picked up to a 93.8 at Q1 end. Gold Star remained constant at 88.7 and total 89.7. And again worldwide, 86.4, so continuing strong in all categories. Overall, it certainly appears that the year ago's membership fee increase had a little or no impact on our renewal rates.","Going down the gross margin line. Margins were up 6 basis points year-over-year in the quarter from a 10 62 last year to a 10 68. And as usual, we'll just jot down a few numbers, give you a few less this time. We'll make 4 columns, and the line items are as follows -- 4 columns, by the way, would be reported fiscal year '12 and then fiscal year '12 without gasoline inflation. And then for the quarter, the same thing reported in Q1 '13 and then without gas inflation. So those will be the 4 columns.","Going across, core merchandising. For the year, it was minus 21 basis points. Without gas inflation, it was minus 13. For Q1, reported was minus 7 and without gas, minus 1. Ancillary, plus 1 and plus 2 for fiscal '12, reported and without gas. And in Q1, plus 14 and plus 15. 2% reward, minus 2 and minus 2; and in the quarter, minus 2 and minus 3. LIFO, plus 8 and plus 8 for last year; and plus 1 and plus 1 in the first quarter. All told, we reported for all of last year a 14% year-over-year decline in gross margins. But without gas inflation, it was minus 5. In the first quarter, we reported plus 6 but without gas inflation, it was plus 12.","So with that chart in front of you, you can see that our overall gross margin was higher year-over-year by 6, but again up 12 without gas inflation. In the first quarter, our core merchandising gross margin, again, was a minus 7, but only 1 basis point lower year-over-year, excluding gas inflation. This 1 basis point negative result compares favorably to the previous 4 fiscal quarter figures where the year-over-year core merchandising gross margin variances had ranged from minus 10 to minus 16 basis points. And again, as you can see in the chart, we just wrote down for all of last year range -- average of minus 13 basis points.","Ancillary business gross margins contributed 14, higher year-over-year gas sales both in dollars and gallons. And higher year-over-year gross margin in the business -- gasoline business represented about 2\/3 of this positive year-over-year gross margin variance. Margins in our food and sundries department, which is a little over half of our core merchandise were up slightly year-over-year in the quarter. While in non-foods, hardlines was flat year-over-year; and softlines margins were down slightly as were Fresh Foods.","The 2% reward feature, again, just a little extra sales penetration there for a minus 2 basis point reward. That, of course, would imply about a percentage point increase in sales penetration to those numbers.","In LIFO, LIFO there was no charge or credit last year, and there was a very small credit this year of $2 million or 1 basis point, implying some minor amount of deflation during the fiscal quarter.","Moving on to SG&A. Our SG&A percentages in the first quarter were lower or better by 7 basis points coming in at 10.05% compared to 10.12% as a percent of sales last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same little chart with the 4 columns, 2 columns for '12, fiscal '12 reported and without gas; and 2 columns for Q1, reported and without gas.","First line item is core operations in fiscal '12 plus 18, and then without gas inflation, plus 12 meaning lower, better or lower by that much. In Q1, plus 10 and plus 5. Central was a small improvement last -- for the whole fiscal year of '12, plus 2; and then without gas, plus 1. And in Q1, SG&A was higher at central, minus 7 and minus 8 without gas inflation.","Equity compensation was minus 1 and minus 2 for all of last year and minus 4 and minus 4 in the first quarter, certainly a reflection of both the higher stock price, as well as every -- there are certain recipients that get them every other year, and we're trading off a year versus that when that doesn't happen. All told, plus 17 and plus 9 for last year. So reported SG&A -- I'm sorry, excluding quarterly adjustments.","Quarterly adjustments was basically that $17 million charge to SG&A last year in the first quarter for I-1183. For all of the year, that was a minus 2 in the reported fiscal '12 column and a minus 2 without the gas inflation. In Q1, it was plus 8 and plus 8. So lower year-over-year, of course. So a total of plus 7 and plus 1, meaning we reported 7 basis points of improvement and -- without gas inflation plus 1 -- 1 basis point improvement.","In terms of a little editorial, operations were lower again and you can see the chart by 10 basis points, but 5 excluding gas. Within core operations, our payroll as a percentage of sales improved year-over-year by 7 basis points. And I think for the first time in the few, past few quarters, we benefited slightly by 2 basis point improvement in health care cost line item.","Our central expenses were higher year-over-year in Q1 by 7 basis points, as you can see, 8 without gas. The big culprit there is something I mentioned in the past few quarters that has continued to increase as the IP modernization costs. We are now in full swing, and that represented year-over-year 7 basis point hit to SG&A.","Next on the income statement line is preopening expenses, $10 million last year. And of course with the ramp up in expansion, that's $8 million higher this year or that was 3 basis points to the company, but $18 million this year versus $10 million last year. Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings. And this year, of course, we had 9, with 5 more just after Q1 end.","All told, reported operating income was $543 million compared to -- last year compared to $639 million this year or an 18% increase. Excluding the $17 million charge for I-1183, operating income last year would have been $560 million or up about 14%.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was much lower this year versus last year with Q '13 -- Q1 '13 coming in at $13 million versus $27 million in last year's Q1. Virtually, all of this is the paydown -- represents the paydown of $900 million of debt back in March, which we did on an annual basis beginning this past March, the annual pretax interest savings to Costco, even though we paid off 5.3% debt and were then foregoing interest at a much lower rate. And that's about $44 million pretax a year.","Now interest income and other in Q1 was much lower year-over-year as well by $17 million, coming in $20 million this year interest income and other and $37 million last year. Actual interest income within net interest income and other, it was only lower by $1 million coming in at $10 million versus $11 million.","The other component of the interest income and other amounted to $10 million this year versus $26 million last year or lower by $16 million. Now, $12 million of that negative variance related to a gain last year in the first quarter on U.S. dollars held in our Mexico joint venture, because the Mexico venture held U.S. dollars and the -- during that quarter, the peso declined relative to the value of the dollar. It's holdings of the U.S. dollar, which is a foreign currency to them required marketing not to market again. That $12 million, of course, half of that gain was ours ultimately since we own 50% of Costco Mexico at the time. So half of the gain was -- so all of the gain was in the interest income and other line a year ago, and half of it was down below in noncontrolling interest as an offset. Most of the remaining year-over-year decrease of approximately $4 million is just a normal swing, plus or minus, where buyers managing the cost of foreign denominated inventory purchases in our foreign operations, which required at the quarter end to mark those to market.","Overall, pretax income was up 17% last year from $553 million to $646 million this year. And again excluding I-1183, that would have been last year's -- $553 million would have been $570 million, so the increase would have been 13%.","In terms of tax rates, our company tax rate this quarter came in at 34.8%, much lower, of course, than last year's reported rate of 40.8%. But excluding the 2 items mentioned in the press release, our effective tax rate last year was a 35.3%, which I think is a more appropriate comparison. Still about a half a point higher last year than this year. And again, that reflects mostly the fact of increasing penetration of earnings outside the U.S. where our federal tax rates generally are lower.","Overall, net income was up 30%, as you know, in the press release. Excluding those 2 items in the press release, that would have been up 19%. Now for a quick rundown of other usual topics, the balance sheet is included in today's press release. Depreciation, amortization, $213 million for the quarter. Accounts payable as a percent of inventories reported, of course, it showed 108% year-over-year and up 5 percentage points from 103% last year. If you just looked at the merchandise inventory accounts payable compared to merchandise inventories, last year was 92% and again improved up to 94%. So most of our inventory's trade payable financed.","Average inventory per last year in the first quarter was $12,871,000. This year in the first quarter was $13,213,000. So up $432,000 or 3%. About $100,000 of that, just under $100,000 of that is that FX strengthening foreign currencies versus the dollar. Another $130,000 is in majors, principally televisions and cameras. We've done very well, as you know, in the monthly sales reports about our comps and the major areas it's been. And the rest is pretty much spread among many departments.","In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter, we spent $488 million. Our fiscal '13 CapEx is estimated to be approximately $2 billion. This compares to CapEx last year of just under $1.5 billion. Some of this higher annual year-over-year estimated expenditures are due to both the higher penetration of the number units planned in Asia, as well as anticipated higher ramp of total openings schedule for Q1 and beyond.","Also I want to mention our dividends, regular dividend. Our quarterly dividend of $0.275 per share quarterly is 110 -- $1.10 per share annualized dividend represents cost of the company just about $480 million. In terms of expansion, as you know, last year we opened 16 units, 17 openings and 1, including 1 relocation. So 16 net openings. For this year we've, as I mentioned, opened 9 new units with no relos. Actually, there's no relos all year. So in Q1, we opened 9. In Q2, we'll be opening later this week in Korea, we will open -- have opened 5 more, so 14 total. We planned 3 -- we planned 7 for Q3 and 9 for Q4, and that would give us our 30. Certainly we're going to get north of 25, and 1 or 2 of those slips will be it. But that's our current budget is 30.","So fiscal '12, the 16 units we added on a then beginning base of 592 represented 3% square footage growth. In '13, adding 30 on a base of the 608 that we began this fiscal year is about 5% square footage growth. And again, that includes 14 in the U.S., 3 each in Canada and the U.K., 2 in Korea, 1 in Taiwan, 5 planned for Japan, 1 in Australia and 1 in Mexico.","As of Q1, our total square footage ended at 88,259,000, which represents an average of just over 145,000 feet per Costco warehouse. In terms of stock repurchase during the quarter, for -- basically for -- as you recall, for all of fiscal '12, we repurchased 7.3 million shares for a total of a little over $600 million. This year in the first quarter, we repurchased 357,000 shares at an average price of $96.41. That represented about $35 million. Mind you that during the 12 weeks, there were only about 3 weeks that we actually purchased stock. For the first 5 or 6 weeks between the beginning of the fiscal quarter and through the day after of first quarter earnings announcement and I think the second week in December, we essentially were locked into a previous 10b5-1 filing, and the stock had moved above that matrix. So we weren't buying it, of course. Once we decided to do a special dividend, we held off on buying during the last few weeks of the quarter as well. So if I looked at the dates we actually bought on an annualized basis, it was in excess of 500 million on an annualized basis. But who knows what that brings for the future?","And lastly, the 2 subsequent events. 2 weeks ago on November 28, we announced the declaration of a $7 share special cash dividend. This dividend will be paid on December 18 to people who own the stock on the close of business on December 10. In total, the dividend represents return to our shareholders of just over $3 billion.","By the way, in connection with the Costco shares held by our employees in the 401(k) Plan, which totals approximately 22.6 million shares. These shares are held through Employee Stock Ownership Plan that had been established several years ago, and dividends paid on these shares are deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. So we will recognize a onetime income tax benefit of approximately $62 million in the second fiscal quarter of '13 in connection with the dividend payable in December 18.","Also on November 28, we announced the completion of a $3.5 billion public debt offering in the form of senior notes. The notes were issued amongst 3 tranches: 3 year, $1.2 billion worth; 5 year, $1.1 billion; and 7 year, $1.2 billion. Given the weighted average maturity of 5 years, our all-in annual rate of interest came in just under 1.25%. So we believe it's extremely attractive financing.","With that, I will turn it back over to Felicia. As you know, later this morning there'll be a supplemental information pack, which includes useful stats, and that will be posted to the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning. Felicia?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Richard, a couple of things. What are your merchants now saying about reflation in '13? I mean, it seems like it may be less than we originally thought, but there still would seem there's some price increases coming down the pike. What's their thought, and what's your thought in terms of what you put in the budget?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think the buyers are the ones that more put in the budget, but in polling the buyers just yesterday actually, the one -- the area that stands out would be components of Fresh Foods, notably protein, beef, poultry and pork. The view there is there's still additional mid to high-single digit inflation expected over the next 6 to 9 months. Beyond that, it's hit and miss. There's -- if I look at our LIFO statistics as an indication, apparel is down ever so slightly year-over-year, but that's probably because it was up a lot last year. So it's coming off of its peak. It's still probably higher than a few years ago. So I would say the overall view, aside from electronics being down slightly per like item, but actually our average price points are up a little, I believe, because we've tended to go towards higher end like 60 and 80-inch TVs and more SLR cameras, DSLR cameras and the like. But just looking down the list of some unusual items. Again, tuna looks like it's come up a little bit, canned tuna. As I mentioned, beef was up some. There's always going to be some ups and downs on produce just based on supplies. Grapes and blueberries are dramatic right now, higher year-over-year, but I'm sure it's weather related not anything else related. And on the downside when I scan the list of the top 20 or 30 items here, most of them are electronics with a few other things, I mean, just anecdotally, pecans and walnuts. But I know a year ago, again, they were way up. So if you put it all in, my guess is, is that gas, who the heck knows? Fresh Foods, inflationary. The rest of it kind of awash at this point. Nothing up or down a lot.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","But probably not enough to dampen demand, it sounds like, right?","Richard A. Galanti","Not on our part.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Now, your big competitor has talked about price investments and other than rotisserie chickens, I can't see a lot of big change in the competitive environment or the intensity of competition. What have you seen in the -- it doesn't look like you've had to do any reaction thus far. Yet likely, that's sort of the plan going forward based on what you're seeing today?","Richard A. Galanti","I can always speak of today and yesterday and prior, but we don't see any big changes there.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then I guess finally, when you look out into January, is there any, either with your individual customers or small business customer, do you think that -- as best you can tell, do you think the cliff hasn't created any change in behavior to date? Do you think it will, or it's pretty much a nonevent for you?","Richard A. Galanti","Well again, we're a little jaded here because our numbers, particularly, our frequencies and our comps have been pretty darn good. I think we, like everybody, have a little of cautious optimism that they're going to do, at least, a compromise and -- or they better. So we're not really focusing a lot on it right now. I think that we do a little better than others, at least, if history continues.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I want to ask a little bit about the core merchandising margin only down 1 basis point x gas. Is there any change there, or do you really point to what was going on there to keep that number muted?","Richard A. Galanti","Not really. I mean as we've always said for many quarters, margins are more us than anybody else. No, there -- it's pretty much as you see it. It's a little better. I don't think we started the quarter saying let's get a little better or let's get that trend back to 0. But that's where it ended up. We're trying to do both, drive business and make money.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And have you seen an uptick in your private label penetration or anything like that, that might be contributing?","Richard A. Galanti","Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean we continue to add products, everything from some wines and spirits to canned goods and all kinds of nuts and candy items. So I'd say it's nothing dramatic. The big dramatic number came in the first half of calendar '09 after the financial crisis where we saw an unusually large increase in sales penetration of private label. I think on the food and sundries side, over 6 months back then, it was like 300 basis points. But generally, we see 0.5% to 0.75% a year. I'm not aware of anything that is different than that right now.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly Black Friday. How did that go for you? It looked like there was a lot of activity in the electronics part of the store, especially with the manufacturing rebates that were being featured there. How does that look for you on that category?","Richard A. Galanti","It was fine. No surprises versus what we had expected. We've now done some of our own Black Friday coupon handouts and the like for the last few years, and we're pleased with it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ICI Group (sic) [ISI Group].","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","It's Greg with ISI. Richard, one question on SG&A and then CapEx. What really drove that central increase? Is that some of the modernization impacts or getting the website up and running in the new format or what should we call out there?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, when I look at IT costs as a percent of sales year-over-year, they were up 7 basis points. My guess is, is 0.5 or 1 -- 0.5 basis point might be re-platforming. Maybe another 0.5 basis point or a whole basis point is normal increase in IT, but clearly, 5 plus of it is modernization. And that's probably has trended up a little extra year-over-year over the last few quarters and will probably peak this year. And then it'll be anniversary-ing against itself each year over the next 3 or 4 years.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it...","Richard A. Galanti","That -- go ahead.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Does it anniversary, do you expect it to go back to 0, or do you actually cycle it becomes a year-over-year down or a good guy?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I don't think it's going to go down for 2 or 3 years. These things take on a life of their own, but it'll be a lot less than 5 to 7 basis points. I mean, I would hope -- again, we haven't budgeted that detail that far out, but I would hope it's 0 to 2, not 5 to 7 next year. And by the way, regarding the prior question as related to Black Friday, I just was looking. That week on a year-over-year basis, frequency was still darn close to 4%, just below 4%, so pretty consistent with what we've seen all over.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","If I could follow-up on the CapEx front. I know it's going up because we're having more club openings. Could you help us on the international openings, and how many of those you actually build and own the store as opposed to lease it, because I imagine it's less when you go overseas than the U.S.","Richard A. Galanti","I don't have that detail in front of me. I can tell you that when we look at the average location cost, which might be on average over the last couple of years, company-wide in the mid-30s, it's tended to be a shade lower than that in the U.S. and Canada and higher, it might be in the 40s on average over like, let's say in Asia. But we've done a couple that are in the low 50s, and I would assume we'll continue to do that. In Korea, we tend to do more ground leases. In Japan, we tend to own. In Taiwan, I think we tend -- it's a combination, some ground leases as well. Australia, I think we own. And Mexico, we own. And the U.K., we own. And in Canada and the U.S. we generally own 80% plus.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the ownership right doesn't seem to change dramatically if we're looking at international or...","Richard A. Galanti","No, particularly because we tend to -- right now we're, at least we're tending to open like in Asia, more in Japan than in Korea and Taiwan, where we tend to own more than lease.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, a follow-up on gross margin. I think you mentioned in hardlines, gross margins were flat. I'm just surprised with that, especially given the strength of electronics. Was there anything else going on in there that have impacted it?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, that's -- not really. I mean I think sales were strong, but in terms of the outright gross margin year-over-year -- look, there's a lot of hot deals over there. I don't -- I didn't really read anything into that. There's not a lot. We've certainly improved on our returns over the last few years as we changed our returns policy in electronics to 90 days instead of infinity. But I haven't, in terms of anecdotally in the last few budget meetings, there's not been nothing -- there hasn't been anything out of there in terms of any issues in electronics or hardline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG","It's actually Matt for Chuck. Most of my questions have been answered. I was just wondering if you could you kind of flesh out your comments about the cannibalization you're seeing in Asia and kind of where that is relative to what you expected? And what you think is going to happen kind of going forward as you continue to open up?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes. Well, I mean it's as we expected. I mean as an example, I think in Taiwan, we opened North Kaohsiung, which took a bunch of business from Kaohsiung. In Japan and earlier this year, we opened and reopened Tamasakai, which was the one unit that was, that had been closed for about 10 or 11 months from the tragedy of the earthquake. Essentially, all of that business went to 2 or 3 nearby -- 2 nearby Costco's. When I say nearby, half an hour away. And the day it reopened, that unit is not comping because it had done these sales over the last year, but it took on that business out of the other 2. So on top of regular cannibalization, we had extreme cannibalization in that one. So all that was, yes, in March. That had subsided this March. But nonetheless, I mean we're opening a bunch of units over there. So that will continue as we expect.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Great and then just a follow-up. In terms of the Northeast, you said it was obviously weak given Sandy, have you seen a recovery kind of take hold and are we back to normal in this area yet?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, we are.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on Asia cannibalization. It looks like the comps and international x currency were running kind of in the 10% range for all of fiscal '11, the first half of fiscal '12 and then the last 2 quarters in the 7% range. Is that entirely explainable by cannibalization, and can you quantify what that cannibalization impact is in total on the International business?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes. A big chunk of it is. I don't have all that detail in front of me, but if I look at Japan in local currency as an example, I mean it's easily from -- I don't have these, I don't have -- this morning, I'm sure it was running in the low-double digits and inflated in the high single-negative digits. And you look at it and we've opened 4 units in the last year. And what did that impact? Those units, those new units aren't in the calculation yet, and so half of the previous units or almost half of the previous units are being cannibalized and 1 extreme -- 2 of them extremely cannibalized because you had a high-volume Thomas [ph] unit existing location that have been closed for 11 months, and all those customers came back to their home base. So yes, we're -- and then again, there's the anomaly in Korea of having to close for 2 Sundays a month. If you just do simple math, that's 150. That's 6% or 7% of the days. You don't lose it all, but you certainly lose some or half of it or who knows?","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, and then back in the U.S., how many clubs that don't have a gasoline station can still be converted at this point? And where are you on that entire path?","Richard A. Galanti","I think the U.S., we have about 440 locations, I could be off 1 or 2, and I think about 70 of them don't have gas. My guess without looking at detail is, is that half of them ultimately can have gas and half of them will never have gas. We're never going to have a gas station at 11th and Harrison in San Francisco or in Brooklyn. Just they're landlocked and forget about it. And I'm sure there'll be some that we're working on. I don't have the list in front of me, and there'll be others that we'll relocate. So I probably a best guess is over the next 5 to 8 years, half of those 70. And my guess is that when we open new ones, virtually, all of them do. There's -- there always will be one outlier, but virtually all of them have gas stations, as is in Canada. Now in Canada, we have, In Canada, we have 83 locations, 38 of them have gas. So 45 of them don't, recognizing we've only been in gas in Canada for the last few years. So again, my guess is that 2\/3 of those that don't have it will have it over time.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. That's great, and then just very quickly. You went through the variance on other income relative to last year, but what's the $10 million of actual other income this year?","Richard A. Galanti","Bear with me. Oh, interest income.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Well, it's $20 million of other income, and there's $10 million of interest. So there's $10 million of other income.","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, there is. He's asking the $20 million that we had. Hold on, I got to look real quick. When I look at interest income and other, hold on a second. Okay, $10 million was investment income and $10 million -- it's mostly equity in earnings of -- hold on. Basically, it's about $8 million or $9 million of FX-related stuff. But by comparison, it's within $0.5 million of the year ago. So no change.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, I was just trying to figure how persistent it is for modeling purposes. I appreciate that, thanks.","Richard A. Galanti","Mind you, just because it's about the same year-over-year means nothing.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I understand.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with BMO Capital.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just on the SG&A leverage, you also pointed out about payroll and health care. Just wondering how sustainable you think that might be throughout the year?","Richard A. Galanti","We always -- certainly payroll depends -- I mean I think we've certainly shown that we've focused a little more on expenses and payroll. And that's we've gotten it down. But certainly sales are a big part of that as well. And increased penetration outside the U.S. where payroll percentages, as a percent of sale, were lower to start with. Our $20.5 average hourly wage in the U.S. is 1\/3 to 60% of that number in other countries and close to it in Canada, of course, and a couple of countries as well, so that helps increasing penetration. On the health care, I think if we've got a couple basis points, it's probably more related to sales being stronger and getting it down a little back to flat without it, so still hit and miss there. Several components of all the new health care legislation, which have kind of hit each year incrementally a little more. I think we're nearing the end of that. So a lot of that stuff, if you will, is in there by the end of this year and the end of next year rather. So I can't predict that it's a trend by any means yet.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, and then any color on the online sales growth in general with the website revamp and the rollout of the U.K. site?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, so far, so good. But I don't want to really give numbers out because it's only been a few -- 1.5 months and probably talk about that more on the second quarter call.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, and then just last question. Any comments on fuel profits in the quarter, comp gallons and total fuel sales?","Richard A. Galanti","Gallons, I think I have. We generally don't give that but I'm here, so we'll give it. Volume, you have it handy? I don't have it. I think in the last couple of budget meetings, it's been running in the mid single-digit range positive, mid to high-single digits.","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then anything on tax rate going forward that we should think about?","Richard A. Galanti","I'm sorry?","Karen F. Short - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Anything on the tax rate going forward that we should think about? I mean I know you've been commenting on the issue, the $60 million, I think, in the 2Q, but...","Richard A. Galanti","Other than that, I think the number in that 35 range.","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Richard A. Galanti","On an overall basis, somewhere in the 35, maybe a shade higher. But the trend line if International's penetration continues, which we would see that again trending down ever so slightly, certainly, all things being equal.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","One thing that really stands out for me with Costco versus other discounters is that the comp growth is very consistent for you across the product categories. So not just food and consumables, but also very strong in general merchandise. So can you expand on what you think you're doing differently or better, especially in hardlines and majors?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think I gave you a different reason for some different categories. From the beginning of time, we've always known we can be strong in foods and fresh foods. And the key is how do you -- and those are fast-turning areas. So how do you turn the bigger-ticket nonfood items because you don't have to have add more square footage for it? If you can get somebody that's turning 6x and 8x up to 9 and 10, that's good in the bigger-ticket item. So we've always focused on that. I think of late, if I think of electronics, certainly our strength in 60- and 80-inch TVs, the bigger, higher quality TVs, that's helped us, clearly people in the door via gas and fresh foods and having them walk by those types of things. I think in apparel, certainly we've made a conscious bigger commitment in several of those areas over the last 1 year, 1.5 years. I think I used the example the last quarter, something as simple as like the men's wool Kirkland Signature pants, which I think we tested a couple of years ago with 100,000 units and last year 200,000 units and this year 1 million units. That's $60 or so a pair, and they're doing well and so not only are we making a decent margin on the KS shirt, we've gone from just a standard one to a couple of different styles with a spread collar. And so we're up to 4-plus million KS shirts. So overall, making some bigger commitments. Jewelry is strong and not just because some of the prices of components have gone up, but jewelry has been pretty good of late.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. New member sign-ups, I'm assuming, benefited in the first quarter due to the rise in gas prices during the summer, especially in California. I mean to what degree did that, was that material? And then gas prices have come down, might that slow member sign-ups in the periods ahead?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't think a lot of it relates to that. I mean yes, a little bit of it when we get somebody, when a newscaster talks about it again in the market, certainly that helps. When I look at the numbers on a base of about 1.3 million new sign-ups in each of the fiscal prior 2 fiscal quarters. Again, when I talked about Australia, Japan last year, which opened near the end of very, very just before Q1 '12 a year ago and into Q2 '12 Japan a couple of units, just those 2 markets represented almost 90,000 fewer sign-ups year-over-year because of the huge sign-ups we have in those markets during these 6 or 8 weeks prior to opening and then they're booked as of opening day. So that again dwarfed anything else, and the fact that we were flat year-over-year given 90,000 less than those few locations is pretty good.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. My final question is previously, you indicated 27 to 30 new clubs as your plan for this year. This morning you said in your prepared remarks 30. Is there anything I should read into that? I mean do you have higher visibility now for this year, or is that -- should I perceive it to be the same?","Richard A. Galanti","I think probably a quarter ago, I talked about 25 to 27. Again if pushed, I'd probably say 27 to 29, but 30 is our budget, and they're all doable. There's always the chance that a couple will fall out, but I think we're getting more confident of those numbers. So if my single point estimate was 27 or 26, now it's 28 or 29.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Costco (sic) [Jefferies].","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's Dan Binder with Jefferies. I had a couple of questions. First on the membership growth. What do you think we should see given, I guess, the extraordinary sign-ups for club last year? What do you think average sign-ups per club should look like this year for the 30 or so stores that you're opening?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't have -- I haven't looked at it that way. And from a marketing -- our membership guy's not here, but it ranges. Again, somebody's locations overseas can be -- and again when I say opening day sign-ups, it's anything that was signed, any paid member sign-ups during the 6 or 8 weeks prior to opening when they got the tabling activities outside of the construction site through opening day. In the U.S. in very strong Southern California markets, but we're popping a unit in where we have a bunch of members already, it's just moving around where they shop or shopping more frequently because they're closer to a location. We might have 3,000 to 6,000 as of opening day and another 5,000 to 10,000 or 8,000 to 12,000 over the next 12 months for that first year. In a new market, a small new market, like Tennessee or a Carolina unit, we might have 4,000 to 7,000 or 8,000 new sign-ups in the first day as of that first day, which is more than a high volume L.A. unit when we opened it, but again it has somewhere to do that. Again over in Asia, we see numbers in the 25 to 50 range as of the opening -- through opening day, and so well over the company average for all members per warehouse, which is in the high 50s. I mean for all warehouses that have been opened, whether they have been opened a week or 29 years. So there's no right number there.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And if we look at existing clubs, how does the new member growth rate look like in existing or comp clubs?","Richard A. Galanti","At the end of the day, again, I don't have that level of detail right in front of me. But what I've looked at it in the past, if our renewal rate is just under 90, let's say, in the U.S. and Canada and just call it 90 for a moment for simplicity, we lost 10, and we gained 11. I mean it's always up a little bit more, just a little bit more than it was at the beginning of the year. And that, of course, is cannibalized a little bit when we opened in existing market a little bit. But then those new sign-ups and those new markets help us. So it's a lot of -- there's no major trend changes if you take out cannibalizing units and take out some of the crazy high numbers and some of the new Asia units or the like.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And my last question was on SG&A. 7% comp, impressive. You got sort of flattish SG&A year-over-year rate. As we look forward, do you think that because of the accelerated store openings this year that to get leverage on SG&A going forward this year we need to be at 6% or 7%, or do you think you can achieve it at somewhat lower levels?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think a couple of things. Again, I feel my guess will continue for these next few quarters. What I didn't mention is there's always 4, 5 miscellaneous line items that generally should add up to 0, some a little higher, some a little less. If I look in the quarter, I think if I added up those types of things, it hit us by 2 or 3 basis points in the quarter versus being 0 or helping us by a basis point. So there's always going to be those things I would think that on average 0, not minus 2 or 3 as it was this quarter. Again, when I look at, I was pleased at payroll, which is -- payroll benefits are 70% of SG&A. The fact that we have increasing penetration overseas that helps us a little bit just because it is, on average, lower SG&A, but again offset that probably for the next year in Japan as an example where we're cannibalizing the heck out of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So Richard, obviously with the 30 clubs that you're targeting at this point in the game, it's a very different from what was seen in the recent past. Can you talk about the difference in real estate process to get those 30 clubs open in 1 year?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, we've put a lot more people on the ground in countries. If I go -- we've been working a long time, and I know it was forever before we even got to perform in terms of how many we say we're going to do when we actually do. But if I look back 3 years ago, 2, 3 years ago as an example between Korea, Taiwan, Japan and Australia, all of that real estate activity was done with no real estate people on the ground. None of our real estate people on the ground in those countries. We now have 1 to 2 people in each of those countries. Same thing with Europe. We've always had pretty much in the U.S. and Canada. So and the pipeline is more full. So again, as the pipeline -- as the time to get to opening in some of these countries are more difficult, takes a little longer anyway, we've built up the pipeline. So I think there'll be more confidence in the next few years of how many we can open based on the pipeline.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of looking at the 5% increase in frequency in the quarter, most retailers have been talking about traffic as being a major issue. Can you provide some additional color around your strong traffic numbers?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, the 5 -- my guess is, by the way, these months are a little strange for a couple of reasons. One, we had a 53-week fiscal year. So it ended like on the September 2 instead of late August. So how did that affect Labor Day a little bit. Same thing at the other end of the quarter. I think Thanksgiving was a week off and in terms of dating. So all those things are in that number. My guess is, is that getting even just below 5, and I mean just below 5, is there 0.5 point in there or a little more that could have been just how all these things ramp? Possibly. So I'm not banking on a plus 5, but certainly, that gives me comfort that our high 3s to low 4s that we've seen 3.5 to 4.5, hopefully, that will continue. There's nothing that we see that changed that until it changes.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right and then...","Richard A. Galanti","Another point is as I've said over the years, the good news is it's a lot of little things. It's everything from the membership base and the demographics, and certainly, gas and fresh foods, certainly big screen TVs. I mean, there's lots of different things that we've been blessed by.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and you called out hardline sales as being quite a bit stronger as compared to recent quarters. Was that -- and you called out several specific categories. What -- was there any kind of key there or was it quite broad?","Richard A. Galanti","It was broad recognizing what we call majors is a big category within hardline, cameras and TVs and the like. Jewelry is not a big percentage category, but had these numbers. So again, that was across the board. I think also even in some of the little things when we bring in items within the furniture category, we've tended to do well with them. And certainly on the softline side, as I mentioned in apparel, that's been a help. So part of it is aggressiveness in some of these categories.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, just could you give some color on how new clubs are performing in markets?","Richard A. Galanti","I'm sorry, what was the last part of that?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","How new clubs are performing, both domestically and internationally?","Richard A. Galanti","Of the 13 openings this fiscal year that we've opened, we got the 14th coming in a couple of days. I think overall, they've done as good, if not a little better, than our overall plans. I mean Craig walks in happy from the opening trips.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Trey Schorgl","This is actually Trey Schorgl in for Michael. We were just wondering if you think there will be any impact from the retroactive income tax increase that was passed last month in California?","Richard A. Galanti","No.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no further questions at this time.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, thank you, everyone, and have a good holiday.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the third quarter and year-to-date operating results for FY '12 conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, you may begin your conference, sir.","Richard A. Galanti","Thank you, Dawn. Good morning to everybody. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter operating results for the 12 weeks ended this past May 6. As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainty include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, for the quarter, our earnings per share came in at $0.88, up a little over 20% from last year's third quarter earnings per share of $0.73 and $0.01 greater than the first call consensus of $0.87. As was mentioned in this morning's release, this year's third quarter included a pretax LIFO charge of $6.5 million or about $0.01 a share. Last year's Q3 had a pretax LIFO charge of $49 million pretax or about $0.07 a share.","A few other items of note when reviewing the year-over-year earnings comparison. Again, our sales results: an 8% overall sales increase and a 5% comp sales increase. The FX impact from earnings of our foreign operations year-over-year, assuming FX rates have been flat year-over-year, that was a hit to pretax earnings of about $8 million or also about $0.01 a share. Also, we had a 9% increase in membership fees that I'll talk about. This increase included a small benefit from last November's fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, also about $8 million pretax or about $0.01 a share. Lastly, we had a favorable year-over-year income tax rate comparison similar to what we saw in Q2.","In terms of sales for the quarter, our reported sales were up 8% total and on a comp basis, up 5%. For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were impacted by gasoline price inflation, which was largely offset by the weakening of foreign currencies on average relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year. On a comp sales basis, the 5% U.S. comp sales increase in Q3, excluding gas inflation would've been a 4% and the reported 5% international comp figure, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been a plus 8%. If you take those 2 together, they offset each other, and the reported 5%, excluding both gas inflation and FX, would have remained at a 5% for the total company on a comp basis.","Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans. After opening 4 new locations in Q1, which ended last November 20, we opened 2 locations in Q2, both in Japan. In the third quarter, we opened a location -- another location in Japan near Osaka, and we also reopened our Tamasakai warehouse in Japan, which had been closed since the tragic events of last March 11 in Japan. We also relocated a unit in Ontario, Canada and opened 2 new units in the third quarter as well in Pharr, Texas and in Huntington Beach, California.","At the end of Q3, our worldwide unit count was 602. All told, that would put our fiscal '12 expected opening schedule at 16 net new units: the 10 we have opened fiscal year-to-date and 6 more planned by fiscal year end here in the fourth quarter. These total 16 would include 10 in the U.S. and 6 in Asia: 1 in Korea, 1 in Taiwan and 4 in Japan. A quarter ago, I had indicated we expected the total number for the year to be 17; 1 has since slipped into early fiscal 2013.Also this morning, I'll review with you our E-commerce results, our membership results and also a little bit of a further discussion on margins and SG&A and repurchase activities.","Again, sales were $21.8 billion, up 8% from last year's $20.2 billion and 5% comp. For the quarter, the 5% reported comp figure was a result of a combination of average transaction increase of 1.7% for the quarter and average frequency increase of 3.6% for the quarter. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, in terms of -- in the U.S., the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast regions were the strongest. International and local currencies, Canada and Mexico were the strongest; with Taiwan and Japan being the weakest, mostly due to the small base of existing units in both of those countries and the cannibalization associated with recent openings over the last year, as well as a year ago the very strong post-earthquake business that we experienced in Japan in the third quarter.","In terms of merchandise categories, for the quarter, within Food and Sundries, we had a comp result in the mid single-digit range, a little below where it had been running in the each of the past couple of fiscal quarters. All subcategories are positive, ranging from 1% to 11% each among those 7 or 8 subcategories.","Within Hardlines, which was in the low single digits positive, the strongest subcategories were hardware and automotive, with electronics being slightly negative for the quarter.","Within the high single-digit Softlines' comp, small appliances, domestics and apparel were the strongest performers. In Fresh Foods, all subcategories were all centered around the mid single-digit range and -- as was the entire category.","Food and Sundries and Fresh Foods continue to experience inflation on a year-over-year basis at the low single-digit range, but we are seeing a little bit of inflation abatement, if you will, in the past few weeks; in fact, some price reductions on some food items like milk, cheese, bacon, butter, coffee, olive oil, flour, et cetera. Still, some inflation we see in beef and across many of the nuts categories.","On the nonfood side, not much inflation expected going forward right now, although probably a little bit of reduction on the apparel side. That being said, you never know until we get there.","Moving down to the line item of the income statement. Membership fees, we reported $479 million -- $475 million versus $435 million year a ago, so up 1 basis point or $40 million and then a year-over-year dollar increase, up 9%.","As I indicated at -- near the beginning of the call, the U.S. and Canada fee increases that went into effect last November benefited Q3 results by about $8 million. Excluding this fee increase benefit, if you will, as well as a slight negative impact of about $3 million from the FX that I mentioned earlier in terms of assuming flat FX year-over-year, the 9% dollar increase in new membership fees would've been up 8%.","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, which I'll talk about it a minute, and we continue to enjoy increasing sales penetration from -- and membership penetration from our executive members. Our new member sign-ups in Q3 were quite strong, up 9% on a year-over-year basis, largely due to the strong international openings this past year in Asia and Australia. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, Gold Star we had 26.4 million, up from 25.9 million 12 weeks earlier; Business Primary at 6.4 million, also at 6.4 million a quarter ago; Business Add-on, 3.6 million compared to 3.7 million a quarter ago. That a lot has to do with just people convert to executive member, and they go out of the add-on category and become their own member. All told, we ended the quarter with 36.4 million member households versus 36.0 million at the end of the second quarter. And including spouse cards, total cardholders, 66.5 million, up from 65.7 million 12 weeks earlier. At Q3 end, our Paid Executive members were a little over 12.3 million, an increase of almost 200,000 in the 12-week fiscal quarter, about 16,000 new executive members per week. That's a combination of new sign-ups, as well as conversions.","In terms of renewal rates, they continued strong. The trends in the U.S. and Canada have sequentially been up every quarter for the last several quarters. At Q3 end -- as of Q3 end, our Business renewal rates were at 93.6%, up from 93.5% a quarter ago and up from 93.3% at the end of the fiscal year; Gold Star, 88.6%, up from 88.4% and 88.1% at the quarter end year -- fiscal year-end. So total all told, in the U.S. and Canada, 89.6% versus 89.4% a quarter ago and an 89.1% at the beginning of the fiscal year.","On a worldwide basis, we're up -- we're at an 86.2%, up from an 85.6% a quarter ago and 85.7% at the end of the fiscal year. So all told, trending -- continuing to trend in good directions notwithstanding the fee increases that we began in November in the U.S. and Canada.","As most of you know, we -- the increases. We increased the annual fee for Gold Star in business and Business Add-on. They're all now at $55 in the U.S. and Canada. That was -- and for Executive member, it went from $100 to $110. As I mentioned, those were effective November 1. But in terms of size, it really was effective January 1. It was effective November 1 for new sign-ups in the warehouse. But in terms of the renewers, the renewers, that started in January and will continue through this December. In all, about 22 million members were impacted or will be impacted by this increase, about half of whom are Executive members and half of whom are the $55 member.","In terms of timing of these increases in the income statement, please recall that the fees are accounted for on a deferred basis, so really, the first big impact to the P&L of that membership fee income line will be in the upcoming fourth quarter and into Q1 into the next year. As I previously mentioned on the first and second quarter calls, there was essentially no impact in Q1 to the membership line; about a $1 million pretax impact to Q2 and as I mentioned earlier in this call, about $8 million pretax in Q3. And again, it\u2019ll be much more meaningful in Qs 4 -- in Qs 1 and 2 in the next fiscal year. It's essentially a 23-month timeline, as I\u2019ve talked about before, how we recognize the $5 and $10 increases, starting when they renew \u2013 with the receipt -- the increase is paid and then spread out over the next 12 months. With regard to Executive Membership, also in conjunction with the increases I mentioned earlier, we increased the 2% annual reward from a maximum of $500 year to a maximum of $750 a year based on eligible purchases. While it's still pretty early to see the complete impact of renewals -- renewal rates from the increase, so far, so good. And in our judgment, we don't expect any issue here.","Going down to the gross margin line. Margins were up, on a reported basis, 5 basis points, from a 10.50% to a 10.55%. I'll ask you to, as usual, jot down the following: 4 columns and 5 line items. The line items will be Merchandising Core; Ancillary; third line item would be 2% Reward; fourth line item will be LIFO; and then Total. And the 4 columns, there'll be 2 columns for each of Q2 and Q3; the Reported column for Q2; and then the second column would be Without Gas Inflation. We try to show you that to compare things on an apples-to-apples basis. The same thing for Q3, so columns 3 or 4 would be reported in column 4 without gas inflation.","So going across, core merchandise in Q2 as you recall, we reported core merchandise margin down 25 basis points. Without gas inflation, it was down 16. In Q3, it was down 21 reported and down 14 without gas inflation; ancillary, minus 5 and minus 4 in Q2 and in Q3, plus 7 and plus 8; 2% Reward, minus 2 and minus 3; and the same numbers for Q3, minus 2 and minus 3 again; LIFO, plus 2 and plus 2 in Q2; and in Q3, plus 21 and plus 21.","So all told, in Q2, we reported 30 basis point year-over-year lower margin; without gas inflation, 21 basis points to the negative. In Q3, as I just mentioned, plus 5 reported; and without gas inflation, a plus 12. Mind you, the big change there is still the LIFO effect of going from $49 million last year in Q3 to $7 million this year. As you can see, our core merchandise was down 21 on a reported basis, but the impact of gasoline sales now being almost 12% -- about 12% of our sales, up a little bit from last year. Net income -- increased penetration caused that number. Taking that out, it was 7 -- it was 14 basis points minus.","Within the 4 merchandising categories of Hardlines -- Food and Sundries, Hardlines, Softlines and Fresh Foods, Hardlines was up in margin year-over-year, where the other 3 categories, Food and Sundries, Softlines and Fresh Foods, down a little bit year-over-year. Ancillary businesses and gross margin, as I mentioned, were up 7 basis points or 8 excluding gas inflation, mostly a function of higher gasoline gross margins and the higher sales penetration as well. Looking at those 2 together, we did it a little better in Q3 versus Q2.","The impact from increasing Executive Membership is minus 2 basis points, implying another percentage point of sales penetration going to those executive members and their eligible purchases. And again, of course, the big delta here, I'm looking at these numbers this way, is the LIFO that I already mentioned.","Moving on to SG&A. Our reported SG&A percentage Q3 over Q2 were lower or better by 2 basis points, coming in at a 9.84% compared to last year's 9.86%. Again, I think the best way to look at this -- explain it is to do the same 4 columns: Reported and then Without Gas Inflation for both Q2 and Q3. The line items would be: Operations; second line item, Central; third line item, Stock Compensation; fourth -- actually just those 3 items and then the Total.","Going across. For operations plus 25, meaning that in Q2 last year our SG&A from operations was lower year-over-year by 25 basis points. Plus means good. And then without gas inflation, the plus 25 was plus 18. In Q3, it was plus 10 and plus 4; central, plus 5 and plus 4 a year -- in Q2 year-over-year. This year, in Q3, versus last year, minus 8 and minus 9; stock compensation, minus 1 and minus 1, and then 0 and 0.","So all told, in Q2, we reported an improvement of plus 29 basis points year-over-year or plus 21 without gas inflation. And this year, as I mentioned, plus 2 and then minus 5 without gas inflation.","So a little editorial here. Just like the gross margin percentage where increased gasoline sales penetration hurt us, it correspondingly helped the core operation\u2019s SG&A by about 6 basis points, such that excluding gas inflation, our core SG&A was lower or better by 4 basis points in the quarter. And this is despite increased health care and workers comp costs which, together, represented a Q3 year-over-year hit to SG&A in the high-single basis points level. In Q2, by the way, health care and workers' comp and benefits had actually helped the year-over-year comparison. Payroll, by the way, within the core business, was up about 7% in dollars compared to the 8.2% sales increase.","Our central expense was worse or higher year-over-year by 8 basis points or 9 basis points, excluding gas inflation. About half of this negative basis point increase is due to higher IT costs related to a combination of things going on, including the modernization of our systems and related activities that we've embarked on of late. This includes, among many other items, the replatforming of our E-commerce site, as well as our move to a new data center in central Washington. Central expenses also impacted a little bit, a couple of basis points, by health care and benefits, as well as 1 basis point on legal fees, which can go either way.","Next on the income statement is preopening expense, $8 million last year in the third quarter and $6 million this year, so $2 million lower. We actually opened 4 units in Q3 this year compared -- including Tamasakai compared to just 1 last year. No issues, simply the timing of these expenses related to the openings before, during and after the 12-week third quarter in question.","In terms of asset impairment closing costs, last year, we had a charge of $1 million. This year we had a similar charge of about $1 million. All told, operating income in Q3 was up by $67 million from $556 million last year to $623 million this year. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was lower year-over-year, with Q3 coming in at $19 million this year versus $27 million last year, so about $8 million lower year-over-year. This mainly reflects the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering and the fact that on March 15, we paid -- debt offering back in February of '07. On March 15, this last month --1.5 months ago, we paid off $900 million of debt. The anticipated annual pretax interest savings, given that we\u2019re paying off effectively 5.4% debt and foregoing interest income on our cash in the 20 to 50 basis point range, is about $46 million pretax per year, and that's net pretax savings to us.","For Q3, this represented a pretax savings from interest expense for about 7 weeks or about $7 million. For Q4, which, by the way, given this is a 53-week fiscal year and therefore, a 17-week fiscal fourth quarter, we had a pretax positive bump of about $15 million. So again, on an annualized basis, given where current cash interest rates are, it's about $46 million a year pretax savings to us.","In terms of interest income and other, that was $13 million better, $18 million this year versus $5 million a year ago. Actual interest income was higher year-over-year by $1 million. The biggest components of the $13 million year-over-year change was related to FX impacts on our business. As discussed with you in the past couple of quarters, internally, about $4 million of this benefit or this year-over-year positive change related to gains on FX contracts that we look at internally as efforts of our -- part of our merchandising efforts, but on a book basis, GAAP basis, it goes on this line. Also, about $7 million benefit of this change increase related to gains on nonfunctional currencies held in foreign operations, notably the fact that in Costco in Mexico, we held some of our cash in dollars given that we also procure significant goods from our U.S. operation on behalf of that operation. For example, so as the dollar strengthened these past couple of months, Costco Mexico generated a book gain, half of that is ours since we own half of the operation. But all of the $7 million goes on this line -- or is recorded in this income statement line, with the offset going down below in the noncontrolling interest line, near the bottom of our income statement. A little convoluted but that's how you report it.","In terms of income taxes, our company tax rate for the quarter came in at 34.8% versus 36.1% last year. Our lower effective tax rate is due both to a few discrete Q3 items year-over-year, some of which reduced our Q3 taxes versus last year and as well to a lower income tax rate in several of the foreign countries where we operate. For example, the statutory federal rate in Canada has come down in the last year by nearly 2 percentage points, and we've seen similar type of things in a couple of other countries. So not unlike Q2 where we saw the tax rate come down a little bit year-over-year, we've seen this as well. And to the extent that it's related to the changes in the tax rates in these countries, that's, at least for now, a little more permanent. Discrete can go either way.","Balance sheet. You\u2019ll -- was part of the press release, so I won't go into that detail other than the fact that the -- a couple of metrics that we always talk about and the accounts payable as a percent of inventories, how much of our inventories are being financed with trade payables. What's reported on the balance sheet is all types of payables, not just merchandising but construction payables and things like that. So on the balance sheet, last year, it showed the payables as a percent of inventories as 106%; and this year, 104%, so down a couple of percentage points. If you just look at merchandise payables and inventories, it was 91% last year versus 92% this year, so a little bit of a positive bump there in terms of trade payable financing.","Average inventory per warehouse last year in the quarter was $11.0 million; this year, $11.7 million, so up $700,000 on average per warehouse. This compares to higher year-over-year per warehouse inventory levels at the end of the second quarter of $1.1 million and at $1 million at the end of Q1, so a little bit reduced from those higher levels. The $700,000 increase per warehouse in Q3 is really spread among many merchandise categories, obviously includes also the impact of inflation year-over-year. Our inventories, we believe -- we feel, are in a very good shape.","CapEx. In Q3, we spent $278 million last year; almost the same this year, $268 million and year-to-date right at $900 million. Given the expansion we've got going on in Q3 -- in Q4 rather, as well as some ramped up expansion in the first 3 or 4 months of fiscal '13, starting in September, we'd expect CapEx during -- for the fiscal year '12 to be right in the $1.4 billion range.","In terms of costco.com. currently, that's -- or Costco Online, that's a combination of costco.com in the U.S. and costco.ca in Canada. Year-to-date sales and profits are up over last year. Our average ticket continues to be a little down, given the nature of the types of products that we sell. But our site traffic continues to grow and was up year-to-date versus last year and for the quarter. Lastly, we are -- as I mentioned, before, we're replatforming our dotcom site, which should be completed and then in operation by the end of the summer. Also, as I mentioned, I think briefly, last summer I was asked about, we are in the process of getting ready to launch our first 2 applications for mobile, both an Apple and an Android. Those are expected to be published and available within the next few weeks.","Let's see, next topic, expansion. Again, for the year, we expect to open a total of 17 units, 1 of which is a relo, so a net of 16 new units. On the basis that we've started with 592, that's a little under 3% unit growth and about 3% square footage growth. As of Q3 end, our total square footage stood at 85,885,000 square feet. As I mentioned earlier, in terms of our plans for CapEx for the year, that includes also a little bit of a ramp-up in the first part of next year. There's plenty in the pipeline next year. We currently have 13 openings planned for the September to December period versus 6 that were actually opened in the comparable 4-month period -- calendar 4-month period in calendar '11. There's always a possibility that a couple of those may slip, but those are all ongoing projects that are in different stages of site work or real estate planning or construction.","In terms of common stock repurchases, in Q1, we purchased $173 million worth of stock; Q2, $145 million; in Q3, $130 million. So -- and that would put us inception to date since the middle of '05 at 113 million shares at an average price of $57.12 a share or almost $6.5 billion we've spent on stock repurchases.  Lastly, our scheduled fourth quarter earnings release, believe it or not, will be on Thursday, October 11. Again, that's for the 17-week and 53-week quarter in the year ended -- ending this coming September 2. With that, I'll open it up to questions with Dawn. And I'm going to put you on the speakerphone here, Dawn.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Richard, couple of things. On the cost side, the incremental IT expense, I assume that has a finite timetable, and I'm not sure what that is, but what might that be? Or is there some ongoing piece of that, that'll be elevated?","Richard A. Galanti","I think you'll continue to see that. First of all, you'll certainly continue to see that over the next year in terms of we have a lot of things going on that have all started in the last year, in the last several months as well. And I don't -- it's hard to say exactly. We're in the process of putting our budget together for '13 in detail. But certainly, it's not going to go from up a few this quarter to nothing next quarter. It\u2019ll certainly be for the next few quarters. Whether it increases beyond there, we'll have to see.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. Then on...","Richard A. Galanti","We've got a lot -- most of those activities are now in place and ongoing.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. On the health care, is that a -- something strange in there in terms of something that hit or a change in trend because the trend had been going very much in the right direction? Or is it something temporary, and they're changing that trajectory?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, it's a little of both. It's a little bit of a change in trend. Pricing is the biggest issue -- mind you, in U.S. -- our U.S. operations are roughly 70 -- low 70% of our company in terms of sales and what have you. U.S. health care costs and other related health, medical, dental, vision are higher per employee than any other country. Overall, we have -- hold on one second; I\u2019m just looking at the numbers here. So a, as I mentioned, the trend\u2019s higher. The other thing is, is that this is -- it's just the U.S. health and benefit costs approaching $1 billion. And on this number, at the end of every quarter, you also actuarially look at what's called IBNR, incurred but not reported. In other words, you know based on actuarial history that even though if you -- as of that Sunday night of the quarter end close, for example, you have employees and their dependents, spouses and children, who have gone to the doctor or had a procedure done or a service done, performed, but it hasn't been reported yet to us or the claim hasn't come in. So I call that the big black box because it's an actuarial number. That actually benefited Qs 1 and 2 by a few million dollars and hurt Q3 by $4 million or $5 million. So again, getting a little more detailed, but that alone was a few basis points swing year-over-year. So I think it's a little of both, that claims have gone up. You have a combination of there is inflation in the mid to high single-digit range. You don't have a lot -- you don't have any kind of abnormal increase in participants. The fact that we have, in the last few years, opened fewer warehouses in the U.S. you don't have as many freebies, what I'll call, new employees that are starting. It's a tough economy; not a lot employees have left, and we're out opening a lot of new units. You don\u2019t have a lot of new employees that in the first 3 to 6 months -- they're not eligible for those first 3 to 6 months based on their hiring status. So it's a combination of all those things, but again, a lot of little things just went negative instead of positive in the quarter. I wouldn't read as much into it beyond that.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then finally, when you talk \u2013 when you think about disinflation or deflation, what's your sense of volume sensitivity to those changes in price, i.e. take dairy and produce as 2 obvious ones? As the pricing comes down, and I know it's going to vary by category -- big category and then subcategory, but maybe think about some of the bigger ones, what that does to volume purchases. How much more milk are people going to buy or certain produce items or apparel, for example?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think different categories are different. I don't know how much more milk people will drink. I think that on apparel and if you want apparel, it's -- and I'm shooting from the hip over here a little bit. If you want apparel, if we can -- if it's enough of a change to get the KS shirt down $1, that's real because you -- people notice that difference. Where it impacts us a little bit is on some things where we have always been known, as you guys know, to hold the price. And I've mentioned on several of the quarters over the last couple of years, when we had huge inflation in cheese, as an example, that impacted the profitability in our food court because we held the price on pizza. Well, good news, it's coming down. So that means we're still holding the price, but we're getting back to perhaps a better margin. And I'm giving you a single data point item but nonetheless, a high-volume item. So those types of things on some of those food commodity items help us in different ways other than driving traffic.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","So all-in, less inflation, do you think that's neutral to gross profit dollars? I mean, I know there\u2019s tons of different moving parts. But neutral to gross profit dollars, is that fair versus higher inflation?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, given that with higher inflation we tend to lag a little because of our nature. I guess, given a little less, that's good for us. But I'd be hesitant to know which way directly it's going to go if you add up all the pieces. Again, I guess it can't hurt and it might help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","It's been a good 2 to 3 years now that your traffic's been really strong, up over 4% in most months. And just wondering when you look ahead, how critical a metric is that for you guys internally when you guys look to balance your price investments over the next couple of years?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I mean, we -- it's hard to answer because we don't -- we kind of give you the aw-shucks answer here. We're just going to invest in price, but it's not something that we look to do forever. We have always felt that you're not -- we're not going to sustain 4% to 5% frequency increases. It's still fluctuating week-to-week, up and down a little bit. I mean, up, but how much up? And we're still feeling pretty good about the fact of where it is. I don't necessarily believe that those 2 things are linked. I would say that one of the things that, in my view, has happened as we've enjoyed 5-or-so percent, 4% to 5% frequency increases now compounding for 3 years running, in my view and taking gasoline out of it, that people -- that just the sure fact that they're coming a little more frequently in our view is, is Fresh Foods. And if they're doing that, there is still a limit to how many TVs they're going to buy, and that extra shop doesn't get the same percentage of extra nonfood discretionary items. So to the extent it comes down a little bit, you have a little bit of offset by the ticket. It may hopefully go on up a little bit. I'm talking of theory here. Who knows? But we feel pretty good about where we are and where we're continuing.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up on the gross profit margin question. With food costs beginning to fall and then holding retail, I mean, how much do you think that helped out you guys here in the second \u2013 sorry, in the third quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't know exactly, honestly. I still feel very strongly that the margins are the levers that we just -- we choose to control rather than what's going on third party in most instances.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my final question is just on store growth. When you take a multiyear view, the pace of openings has really begun to slow the past few years in the 15 to 20 per-year range. And it's clearly not a capital constraint given your balance sheet. I'm just wondering why you guys don't think you can open up more stores. Is it do you need to invest more in your real estate team? Is there site issues? And if you could just flush that out for us.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, one reason I went as far out to tell you, mention on the call, what we have planned for the fall is to tell you that next year is starting off stronger in terms of number of openings. And part of that is an investment in additional real estate. We had more people landed in different countries. And one of the comments, I've mentioned, I believe, on these calls, as well as when people have come out or called us, that Craig has indicated -- Craig Jelinek, has indicated a desire to ramp that up a little bit but do it within the controls that we have. So I think that part of it is, is the switch from international to domestic, having a higher percentage international. There's been a longer window to get those open. The pipeline has more in it, and we'll continue. But I think you'll -- this sounds like a broken record, but I can't go beyond talking about the first 4 months of -- or the last 4 months of calendar '12 because it gets a little less exact. But certainly and hopefully that's an indication that we'll see some improvement -- or increase in that number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First, on the gas business, the last couple months, you've had fairly high gas prices, but the comp gallons pumped, which we sort of think of as a proxy for traffic at the pumps, seems to have flattened out a little bit. I'm just kind of curious what your thoughts are on that. And then the second question was related to membership. I think you said your member growth was being, in part, largely driven by international. I was wondering if you could just give us what the U.S. comp member growth looked like.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, on the latter question, I don't have that detail in front of me. Clearly, it's a lot less. I mean, generally speaking, when we haven't opened -- over the last couple years, when we have not opened a lot of international locations, the number might be a couple of percentage points to the minus or 5 percentage points to the positive, depending on openings. Generally speaking, the fact that our renewal rates improved a little and we're still seeing net increases in our total membership base, you're still getting -- we're still maintaining that. But the big difference is, is when we open -- we opened Huntington Beach, California, and I don't have the specifics, just a week or 2 ago. And needless to say, we've got a lot of units in the greater L.A. market, so a lot of those members are existing members. We're not getting as many new sign-ups, and I don't have the exact number of how many sign-ups we had as of opening day. But it could be 3,000; it could be 8,000. But it's not 30,000 and 40,000 or 50,000, like we've had in the last -- in some of these international openings. When I say, as of opening day, it's the sign-ups that we have during these 6 or 8 or 10 weeks prior to opening when we've got the folding tables and the flags and the balloons out front so people can come by and sign up in advance. I mean, the numbers are just chart-popping in some of these Asian and Australian countries. In terms of gallons comp, our trends -- we again for -- gosh, 6, 8 months ago, we were enjoying some months where the gallons comps were in the 10% range, 8% to 10% range. I believe, of late, it's been in the 3% range, 4% range and again, it's how much -- for how long can we sustain that. The fact that gas prices have actually come down a little bit in most of the country, that swing does make some changes to that number. I think that again, I don't think we can sustain tens. I think I feel confident we can continue to sustain numbers better than the U.S. economy -- or the U.S. gasoline sales overall, which we've done handily, and we'll go from there.","Daniel T. Binder - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then do you have a number on dotcom sales growth for the quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't. We don't give out as much detail on some of the components that we used to.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Nathan Rich","Richard, this is actually Nathan Rich filling in for Deb today. If I could start, I wanted to get your thoughts on the macro environment and how you feel about the discretionary side of your business right now.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, you look at -- first of all, in terms of our discretionary business, as I think I mentioned, Softlines is up in high single digits. Hardlines is -- x electronics, is in the low single digits; with electronics is lower because majors is down a little bit. And again, this is one person's view with reading the same things, I mean, as you read. Our view is, is notwithstanding our relative sales strength and member sign-ups and renewal rates and all that stuff, we still think it's pretty fragile out there. We are gratified that we can get people in more frequently than we ever have. We believe fervently that, that's related not only to the extreme value proposition but to fresh foods and gas, and so those are things that have driven more people in more frequently. And if we got you walking by the TV or the batteries or the patio set or whatever it might be, there's a chance you might buy it. So we get a little jaded given our relative success out there, but we're not seeing any big risk of a big shoe dropping here, but we're also not seeing anything that's driving it in a big way that's sustainable right now. You look at the housing starts and you look at -- these things are improving slightly, but it's got a long way to go. So we are -- the good news for us, I think, is that notwithstanding -- and this is not a change from our position, we've felt this way for a few years now, that there's nothing that -- there's not a big engine underneath a lot of this. But it is, to our -- to the credit of the activities that with monetary policy and good fortune that we have in the U.S. that things are actually growing a little bit. That's a positive. But it's not like we're not concerned about what's going to happen tomorrow in the economy. That being said, given that we have extreme value proposition that we're in and out of seasons early, we are still -- throughout this last 3 years and continuing, we are aggressive on discretionary items, whether it's patio furniture, which we did well with; apparel, which we are doing well with; patio, we did well with the seasons behind us pretty much. But we can -- in our view, we can afford to be more aggressive even given those concerns in terms of merchandising.","Nathan Rich","Great. And then I also wanted to ask if you think that you've gotten a benefit in your pharmacies from Walgreens being out of the Express Scripts network and if that's driving traffic to the rest of the club as well.","Richard A. Galanti","A little bit, but I wouldn't say that's something that anybody's talked big around here in our budget meetings. I'd have to look at it in more detail. But I can tell you nobody\u2019s mentioned that as being a big reason why we're getting more frequency. I mean, what I hear and what we see is when you\u2019ve got Fresh Foods being whatever, 12%, 13%, 14% of sales and growing nicely. When you\u2019ve got gas driving more people into the parking lot and the percentage of those, that's a much bigger impact than some modest improvement in the pharmacy scripts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Richard, if we could just look at -- when we look at traffic and ticket, we've seen the ticket has been inching down sequentially the last few quarters. I'm just wondering is that a function of inflation abating and how we should think about ticket if we see continued abatement across the inflationary line. Would you expect that offset in volume?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, clearly, some of it's inflation abating; some of it's increased penetration of private label. I think that probably continues a little bit. But again, I use the silly example of cheese coming down. That doesn't affect the price of our pizza because we were, no pun intended, eating that increased cost and having a -- incurring a lower margin. And I think the same thing could be said for some of the raw material products in bakery. So it's not all -- it's a combination of some things that help you a little bit and some things that hurt you a little bit on that. And I guess the last thing is we're always trying to upscale the item and upsize the item.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. So a follow-on to that, as others are also seeing some of those costs coming down, what are you seeing competitively? Obviously, we just saw the quarter that Wal-Mart put out there; they seem very committed to the price investments. It finally seems to be working. What are you seeing competitively? As other's cheese prices are coming down, are they starting to come closer to you?","Richard A. Galanti","First of all, just following up on the last question and my response, the other thing that's impacted that number, at least not year-over-year but from the last quarter or 2, gas prices have come down. And that's in that average ticket, and also FX has impacted it a little bit. So year-over-year on the FX. And getting to the other question, again, I don't want to sound cavalier about it, but our view is, is we're always fiercely competitive. We haven't seen on a cross retail, every type of competitor basis, any big changes of how we have to react. We are always reacting strongly. Certainly, there's always going to be items where, whether it's Wal-Mart or a supermarket chain or Home Depot, for that -- and Lowe's for that matter, where we're going to respond and get down, but -- come down in price. But there's other things that are going the other way. Our -- one of the things that helps us a little bit is specialty items, whether it's high-end nuts or organic items. As we take some of our penetration in anything from ground beef to fresh turkeys to organic milk, our higher-end member, we can a, show a better savings on those items, and there's a little bit more margin protection on those items. So all those -- again, there's 100 different things that are affecting it up and down. I'm not terribly concerned about what you -- the question you asked about how that's going to impact us.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, just on the 53rd week, any help you could provide us on line items in terms of how the week impacts gross margin or SG&A.","Richard A. Galanti","It really doesn't impact it a lot. Most all things are spread over the extra week. So you have an extra 2% of weeks, if you will, 1 over 52, but it's not like you get a free week of rent. All that stuff -- there's a small amount of depreciation benefit, not enough to move the needle a lot, but the big things, like vacation -- payroll, vacation, health benefits, rental, though we don't have rent on all the 20% of our unit that we lease, utilities, all of those things are -- you have an extra week of those costs in that 53rd week. So if 1 over 52 is the incremental weeks, a shade better than that is what you'll see from that week.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin McGranahan with Bernstein.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up first on the competitive question a little bit. I think first quarter we've seen that Sam's, on an x gas basis, had a little better comp than you did on an x gas basis. So just kind of curious what you think they're doing right or is it just a matter of easier compares. And have you seen any change out of BJ's since they've exited the public realm?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think that they're doing a better job than they were before is what I hear from our operators, to their credit. I think they had a little easier comparison, but I'm not going to take that away from them. On BJ's side, we -- the only thing we've seen is they're still aggressive on openings. They tend to -- in my view, from, again, the last few months of budget meetings, there's not a lot of discussion in our budget meetings about pricing necessarily, but more about their opening new units, and they're intending to open these -- I forget if they're 75,000 or 85,000 square-foot units. So they're continuing to grow. Hold on one second.","Bob Nelson","[indiscernible]","Richard A. Galanti","When we do -- Bob has made a point -- good point. When we do our weekly competitive shops and we see those at our budget meeting by region every 4 weeks here, in terms of the delta of competitive like items, commodities, Bounty paper towels, Tide detergent, soda pop, Advil, you name it, from our own pricing versus our competition, we're not seeing any big change in those deltas.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then actually, a nice lead into my second question, which is if you look at the underlying merchandise margin, maybe that 3 quarters now, there\u2019s some moderate compression on the underlying merch margin. Next quarter, you begin to anniversary a much, much more moderate expansion. And then in the November quarter, you actually start hitting anniversary on compression. So how are you thinking about kind of price investment given that you're not seeing any deltas combined with traffic that has slowed down a little bit?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I mean, it's that -- I guess I don't want to be too assertive or aggressive here. When we anniversary that -- the next quarter, you're right, will be the fourth quarter of this anniversary-ing of year-over-year lower core merchandise margins. There's no desire here to drive that in one direction. I mean, we have always -- even during these last few quarters, we've stated that we feel good about our ability to generate margin when we need to and still be very competitive. So again, I can't predict what's going to happen in Q1, but certainly, your comment is a good one.","Colin McGranahan - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Final question. We obviously get this on a lag basis, but segment margins, you\u2019ve had now a couple of quarters in a row where the other international segment margins are down. Obviously, it's a quarter ago. But what's driving that?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think 2 things, the price investment that we've talked about. And also, in a couple of those countries, the cannibalization, that's impacted as well a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Richard, a couple questions. First, just on May, it looks like from your reported sales numbers, it may be that perhaps the month got off to a softer start. Just curious as to how you've seen this month flow so far, that's my first question.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, we can't -- I can't talk about May until we report May.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, shifting over to the accounting for the extra week, how does that impact the MFI? Will you get an extra week of MFI? Or is the accounting different on that?","Richard A. Galanti","\\","Yes, you'll get an extra week of -- it's daily. So that extra week, you'll get an extra week of membership fees.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly with Craig now in the CEO spot here for 5 months, just speak to maybe are there any strategic differences that you're hearing, seeing from him versus Jim, whether it be on day-to-day stuff or even capital allocation, when you've got 13% of the market cap, I think in net cash right now. Just trying to understand some nuances there with him in charge right now.","Richard A. Galanti","Sure. Well, I think, Craig is the best one to ask that question. He, by the way, is in Australia today just looking at new sites with Jim and with Jim Murphy, our Head of International. And the -- Craig said it best. He says his goal is a, not to screw things up. And also, he certainly appreciates the culture of what we do. The things that he's mentioned and that I've noticed as well is a desire to get a few more openings done more quickly. Clearly, his background of 30-plus years in operations, I think, I talked about the fact that certainly, he's focused on some efficiencies in the warehouse. The fact that -- the 8-or-so years, he spent in merchandising, but then handing that baton back to Doug Schutt, who's now in charge of all merchandising. And as Doug\u2019s -- most of his career was spent in merchandising. So I think those are positive things for us. Again, I don't expect to see big changes. I expect to -- again, growth being one of them. I think he's giving Doug and Jay Reighland [ph] under Doug, a little bit more leeway to see what they can do with dotcom. Although don't expect giant changes. I mean, the more significant changes to start with are replatforming and adding a couple of apps. But the focus is going to be on hot merchandise at great prices and making sure we're communicating that to our members.","Peter S. Benedict - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And anything on the capital allocation front, Richard.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, the biggest thing on the capital allocation front is going to be hopefully a ramp-up in expansion. And beyond that, we just announced another higher than earnings growth increase, if you will, and looking at history of dividend. And we continue to buy stock back. But the core issue of having a lot of cash, as you just said, isn't going to go away overnight nor do we feel compelled to do it for the wrong reasons. But clearly, we do feel compelled to ramp up expansion and certainly we're doing that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","A clarification on the renewal rates. I think you said that sequentially in the U.S. and Canada, you went up by 20 basis points. And then worldwide, you went up by 60 basis points. Did I take that down correctly? And I guess, if that is\u2026","Richard A. Galanti","That's true -- I think it was 50, 85.7% versus 86.2%, and it's worldwide. So that would imply a bigger increase in the 20% of our company or 18% of our company that's non-U.S. and Canada. Mind you that -- I mean if you go back to the beginning of time in the U.S., if we signed up 100 members in year 1, about 70 renewed in year 2,  renewed that first time. And in year 2, you also had another 100 sign-ups. In year 3, the 70 -- that new 100 was 70 in year 3, their first year of renewing. But the 70 from year 2 in their second year of renewing was a higher percentage than 70, let's call it, high 70s maybe. And then of course, over time, when you\u2019ve got a lot of mature members and mature locations, we're up to that 89 number in the U.S. and -- 89-plus number in the U.S. and Canada. Given that we've -- and when you're signing up so many more people in a new market, you also have an even lower than 60 -- 70% rate. I think it's close to the 60% in that first year overseas. But then we're still getting more. I mean, in Asia, I think the average number of members per location is almost double the company average. So we're still adding a lot of people over there, albeit at a -- not only a lower renewal rate. So that's why you see -- that number jumping implies that yes, you're having a bigger improvement overseas, but you started at a lower base overseas, a lower renewal rate.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Right, okay. I mean, just on the same maturity level then, would you be tracking similar to the U.S. and Canada to adjust for that mixed effect?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I'd say no because you're starting lower overseas. If we open a new unit here in the United States, it's not that new. I mean, certainly people know us even in a new state, which there aren't a lot of those anyway. Whereas over there, it's been a little bit of a positive frenzy, and so you're going to get a lot more people coming in to look see; and by definition, more of them not renewing in that first year. But relative to what we've seen over the last several years in those countries, I would say that new units are starting off -- units that are 2 and 3 years old are trending better than the units that we opened 8 or 9 years ago that were in their first, second or third year.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. Most of my other questions have been answered, but one back on the gross margin. As you have a moderation in input costs, should we think of that possibly flowing through to a little bit better margin? And then can you just highlight what extent markdowns played a role in this quarter, if it was significant?","Richard A. Galanti","Markdowns weren't an issue at all relative -- on a year-over-year basis. And the first question I can't answer, just, I\u2019d get shot.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Well, maybe in this period as you saw a moderation going through the quarter, did that help you as you progressed through the quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I'm sorry, repeat the first part of the question","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Some of the food costs are beginning to moderate. Take whole foods, they saw an increase in their gross margin partly from that. I guess, I would think that would start to help you on the food side. So I guess I'm curious if that's happening. And if it's not, why not?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, well, again, I think we were always the first to go down and we're not -- frankly, we're not really -- I don't think we even price shop whole foods. So I don't think that's been an impact to us. I think, again, where we're getting some margin improvement on lower commodity costs are those items where we held the price. And as I mentioned, in previous quarters, it's hurt us a little bit. The fact that we tend to lag when there's inflation, the fact that there's less inflation is an improvement on that. Again, I think those are \u2013 that\u2019s generally been a little better for us than not. But we're still investing in price, and again, it's not completely scientific. We do what we think we need to do, and we think we're driving our business in the right direction. And we're stronger today than we've ever been.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked, but I did want to just touch on the consumer electronics category. If you look at your stores, you, like others, have started, I think, really pushing into the bigger screen TVs. So I guess first question is, is that true? And with that, what type of consumer response are you seeing in these bigger TVs? And Richard, maybe just a comment on -- any thoughts on what we\u2019re seeing out of the manufacturers in the TV categories that are attempting to put a process in place to maybe keep pricing more firm.","Richard A. Galanti","Our TV sales actually improved throughout the quarter. We are driving bigger TVs; you\u2019re right there. So the average price point of our TVs, I'm looking just at the last 4 weeks of the quarter. I've got some -- a little detail. The sales -- the average selling price per TV was about the same year-over-year, which is even though, there's the inflation so it's all about driving the customer towards a little bit higher screens. I mean, we're doing 60s, 70s and even 80s now out there, as well as the smaller ones. And the second question; I'm sorry.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","With the -- just on the manufacturer efforts out there now. They're trying to limit promotional activity in their TV sets. Have you guys seen any impact of that or what are your thoughts going forward?","Richard A. Galanti","I haven't yet, and what I know is what you know based on what I think I even read yesterday talking about that. We haven't seen the big promotional stuff like $300 or $400 off on a TV in our MVMs for a few years, and that went to nothing for a while and then to something. And I'd say it's still something, but not as good as it was a few years ago and not as bad as 0. So not a big change yet. And part of that, I think, is that we've gone -- we've tried to drive the TV in towards the bigger sizes where there is perhaps a little better.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes. And then if I could, just a separate question, more of a, I guess, a longer-term type of question. We've talked for a while about the traffic-driving benefits of the Fresh Food category. I guess as you look at the Costco enterprise now, how much more is there still to come from the benefit of fresh foods? I mean, as far as maybe expanding the categories, putting into more centers, for how much longer will this be an incremental driver of traffic, you think?","Richard A. Galanti","I mean, that's a hard question to answer. I can tell you that, again, when we attend the monthly budget meetings and the merchants get up and talk, they still are coming up with new stuff. I mean, I look at something like bakery, which, a few years back, after years and years of great growth, was kind of slowing. Well, guess what, Sue McConnaha, our VP of bakery operations and longtime employee of Costco, and her staff, they came up with a lot of new items, and what we're doing now in that area is there's a lot of in and out items during the year, whether it's the red velvet cake or the cupcakes, not just having the same old great giant chocolate cake and apple pie. And it's specialty breads, artisan bread. So I think we've -- we do what -- we do well what we do in terms of being merchants and mixing it up a little bit. So I think there's still -- I still get -- I still feel pretty confident when I hear the presentations from the various merchandising categories, particularly on the Fresh Foods side, that we've got a lot of good things going on, whether it's specialty items, high-end commodity items from around the world, organic items, things that separate us from our competition and continue to drive our business in the right direction. The challenge is always going to be on the nonfood side. And I think, we've -- again, I look at things like apparel where we've driven more business, you see more presentation out there. So we've got good comps in that. We're always trying to drive the nonfood side because we know we got you in to get the chicken and the paper towels. And how can we get you to buy some more of those things? And so it\u2019s that ongoing focus for treasure hunt and that ongoing focus for those specialty items. And so I feel, again, it's a qualitative answer, but we feel pretty good that there's \u2013 we\u2019ve  still got a lot of runway but that's partly because Craig is -- and Doug are pushing that with the buyers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Question, most retailers saw some sort of lift from the weather in February and March and then some sort of moderation in April. It doesn't seem to be the case for you. So perhaps you can share your thoughts on whether there was any pull-forward. And if not, why don't you think that happened?","Bob Nelson","[indiscernible]","Richard A. Galanti","We -- Bob is helping me here with this answer. We don't -- it did happen, but we haven't really quantified it. It's probably not as big of an impact. Certainly, we're in 42 states so we\u2019re across the country. Certainly -- I mean, what always surprises me that it could be raining and we're bringing out patio furniture at the end of December, the 26th and all through January and it's selling like heck because -- it's selling well because people \u2013 it\u2019s a great deal and people know if they don't buy it, they may not get it. So I think we're a little bit of an unusual animal as it relates to some of the weather impacts. Even seasonal apparel, we're bringing it in a month or 2 earlier than typically a traditional retailer on those areas would be. So we don't see as much -- in my view, we don't see as much of an impact of weather even in a geographically discreet area.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","But you're saying there was a small one -- there was a small impact.","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, there was a small impact.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then as you think about last year, I think gas prices peaked in May last year and started out flat to start of the year and maybe up 35% year-over-year in May. I mean, in retrospect, do you think is there a number you could put out there and say, you know what, in these months, traffic maybe got 100 basis point lift because of the gas, but that seemed to be in the rearview mirror now?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, we know -- it's hard to say. We know that when gas spikes, it helps our frequency. And when gas subsides, it hurts -- or doesn't help it anymore, the frequency. We know that every person that comes in the gas station, about 30% of them do come into shop that same day. Whether they came to shop or to do gas, who knows? But it's got to be a positive. And again, I can't tell you more than that.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Fair enough. And then finally, West Coast. It's not been in the best category for some time. Can you talk about if weather actually had any negative impact there? Or is there something that you're seeing with the consumer maybe feeling better going out to eat more, so frequency going down, something like that?","Richard A. Galanti","I'd be hard pressed to know the exact reasons. I know one of the things was, is that California, as an example, was particularly strong top-wise if I go back when it was a stand-out for the first time. So it's coming off of some of very strong comparisons from a year earlier. I can't tell you that's the only reason, but certainly that was one of the reasons. Why don\u2019t we take 2 more calls?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Could you give us the number of Asian stores that are in your pipeline over the next 2 to 3 years? And when do you think you'll really start ticking up in the mix of international, in the store openings as you look out the 5-year period?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think if you look at this year, 16 of 10 in the U.S. and 6 elsewhere, I would've guessed it was 50-50. I don't have the original budget in front of me. Part of that is, is they do take longer and when they run into a little snag, it's more than a month, a little snag. But again, going forward, I would say the trend will go from 6 out of 16 this year, whatever percentage that is...","Unknown Executive","6 out of 16.","Richard A. Galanti","37%.  I think it'll be 50-50 or close to that next year and a little \u2013 or close to that and then higher than that in the year following. But -- and that's based on what's in the pipeline now and the fact that, certainly, these countries are less saturated than the U.S.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And how about the number of them that are going to be Asian stores in the next few years?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, our activity in those 3 countries started sooner, and so there's more in the pipeline, so sure. But again, I can't predict exactly how quickly, but yes. And as I mentioned, the guys are over in Australia for the last 2 days looking at a bunch of sites, so I'd throw that in the pipeline recognizing there's only 3 in there right now.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So you've got 3 Asian stores in the pipeline right now in total?","Richard A. Galanti","No, no, no. There's 3 Australian locations already open, and I'm sure that'll be ramped up given that we're looking at a lot of sites. The same thing with Asia. There's -- I was just trying to get to that page, hold on. We ended this fiscal year with, hold on, 30 locations between the 3 countries. And my guess is we'll have gone in those 3 countries from opening 2 or 3 a year, in the total, a couple of years ago to having opened 8 this fiscal year, if all goes as planned. And I would say, easily more than 8 over the next couple years. So the trend is in the right direction in that regard. But again, they take a little longer too. But we've -- as I mentioned earlier, we have ramped up our expansion, our real estate, personnel efforts and so we've got more in the pipeline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sean Naughton with Piper Jaffray.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So just following up on one of the economic questions on the consumer. Obviously, a lot of concern out there, a lot of negative headlines. Have you seen any more exaggerated kind of peaks and valleys in your traffic trends on a week-to-week basis in Q3 versus Q2? And then just secondly, following up on the international side. Can you comment on how the U.K. business did in the quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","I'm sorry, what was the second question?","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","The U.K. business.","Richard A. Galanti","Okay. Well, the first question, the biggest thing in the last few months has been holiday shifts, like Easter, Mother's Day, even. Those things shift a week or 2 weeks and it wreaks havoc with our comparisons of traffic and volume. They're a bit -- a little bit geographically and weather, but nothing to -- that's usually in one region where -- if southern California had huge rainstorms for a few days, that's going to impact a 2-week period down there, minus and plus. In the U.K., it's come off of -- it has been -- its comps in local currency for a few years have been pretty tough for us, flat to up a little, and they're up a little better than that right now.","Sean P. Naughton - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess, just following up on that. You talked a little bit about being on the ground with essentially some people in Europe over the last 12, 18 months. Does what's going on over there change anything with respect to the signing of anything that would potentially be in the pipeline or you're thinking around that particular market?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't think it changes the timeline. If anything, and given that we'll be using dollars to convert into different currencies, it's actually a little less expensive. I guess the question is it\u2019s a little bit expensive because you're also going to be there. The economy's tough right now. If anything, it's making it a little easier for us, but I don't think it's beating anything up for us. And again, as our history has shown, don't expect us to go into any country and have 10 locations in operation 2 years out. We'll open a unit or 2 in the first couple years and go from there and see how it goes. And so we have a lot of patience in that regard.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. Sir, I will now turn the presentation over to you for any closing remarks.","Richard A. Galanti","That's it on our side. Bob and Jeff and I are around to answer any additional follow-up questions.

These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today's press release, we reported our fourth quarter and fiscal year end 2017 operating results for the 17-week and 53-week periods ended September 3 and our September sales results for the five week retail month ended this past Sunday, October 1. For the 17-week fiscal fourth quarter, reported earnings came in at $2.08 a share, up $0.31 over last year's fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.77.","In comparing our year-over-year fourth quarter operating results, several items to note. First, of course this year\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter was comprised of 17 weeks of operations. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter results covered 16 weeks. We just finished the year which had the extra weekend. Second, the improved results related to co-branded credit card, as we reported in each of our first three quarters of fiscal \u201917, as the Citi Visa co-branded credit card program again positively impacted our year-over-year gross margins by 14 basis points and SG&A expenses by 8 basis points and our overall bottom line in Q4, benefiting earnings year-over-year by an aggregate of 22 basis points or $0.13 a share over the 17-week fourth quarter. More detail to follow later in the call on this.","Gas profitability, the third item. Our profits from gas during the quarter as compared to last year's fourth quarter were higher by about 40 million pretax or $0.05 a share. Number four, gross margin, this year's fourth quarter margin, the gross margin included $20 million of pretax benefits from non-recurring legal items, which were partially offset by about a $10 million reserve charge for inventory losses attributable to Hurricane Harvey. Together, this net $10 million pretax benefit represented a benefit of 2 basis point improvement to gross margin or about a penny and a half share benefit to earnings per share.","Fifth item of note, SG&A. This year's fourth quarter SG&A expenses included an $11 million or about a penny and a half negative hit related to Hurricane Harvey. This represented about a 3 basis point detriment to our reported SG&A percentage in the quarter. Number six, modernization related IT, as a percent of sales, only slightly higher by a basis point year-over-year. Next, FX. There's two FX items to point out. On an operating basis compared to a year ago, foreign currencies had a very slight negative impact to earnings, less than $1 million pretax.","Also, in our interest income and other line, the year-over-year swing in gains and losses related to accounting for our FX exposures in the other countries where we operate. In Q4, the year-over-year swing was about a minus $12 million pretax or $0.02 a share hit, impact to EPS year-over-year. Last year, in Q4, we had a gain of 11 million in terms of these items. This year, we had a loss of about $1 million recorded in this year in the fourth quarter.","Number eight, income taxes. We had favorable discrete tax items in both fourth quarters, both this year and last. In last year's fourth quarter, discrete tax items benefited the last year's fourth quarter earnings by $0.05 a share. This year's fourth quarter discrete positive tax items benefited earnings per share by $0.03, so $0.02 lesser benefit this year over last year. And lastly, LIFO, there was no LIFO charge or credit in this year's fourth quarter results whereas last year's fourth quarter results had a LIFO credit of $31 million, reflecting deflation in our LIFO indices a year ago or a $0.04 per share benefit last year versus zero this year.","Turning to fourth quarter sales, reported sales were up 16% in the quarter, including the benefit from the extra week and reported comparable sales figure, which compares a like-for-like number of weeks year-over-year was up 6.1%. For the quarter, the plus 6.1% comp sales figure was helped by gasoline price inflation to the tune of about a half a percentage point and hurt slightly by a slight detriment from the FX impact.","In terms of new openings, in Q4, we opened 12 new locations, six in the US, two in Canada and one each in Australia, Japan, Iceland and France, the last two countries being new countries for us as well. As of our fiscal year end, we operated 741 locations worldwide, including 26 new buildings during the year. We opened 28, but two of them are relos.","This afternoon, I\u2019ll also review with you membership trends and renewal rates and update on our co-branded Citi Visa card. I'll discuss a little bit further about margins and expenses, I\u2019ll discuss e-commerce results and some recent initiatives, a couple of other new initiatives as well and lastly, I'll give you a recap of our September sales results for the five week period ended this past Sunday.","So on to the results. Sales for this year's fourth quarter, the 17 weeks ended September 3 were $41.36 billion, up 16% over last year's 35.73 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comp sales were up 6.1% for the quarter on a reported basis, up 5.7% after accounting for fluctuations and gas prices and FX. For the quarter, our reported 6.1% comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction increase of 2.1% for the quarter, an average shopping frequency increase for the company worldwide 3.9% up and within that 3.9%, it's up 4.4% for the US.","In terms of sales comparisons by geography, for the fourth quarter, within the US, the Midwest, Southeast and Texas regions were the strongest, with other US regions not far behind. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries were Japan, Mexico and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, within that 6% reporting comp, food and sundries up about 4%, strong categories include spirits, deli and frozen, hardlines, up in the mid-single digits.","Overall, strongest department results were lawn and garden, tires, toys and consumer electronics itself were up in high singles. Softlines were up in the high singles overall with housewares, jewelry and home furnishings showing the best results and in fresh foods, comp sales were in the mid-single digits, relatively consistent across various departments of meat, bakery, deli and produce.","Within ancillary, gasoline had strong comps in the quarter aided by higher average sale price this year versus last as well as very strong gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the mid-teens, followed by optical and food court.","Moving to the line items of the income statement, I\u2019ll start with membership fees. Membership fees were up 13.4% or $111 million year-over-year. As a percent of sales, they were down 5 basis points, as we expect in part due to simply the strong sales results. Of the $111 million increase in fees year-over-year, about 15 million related to the membership fee increases we took, a little over half of that $15 million from the fee increases taken in our international operations last September 2016 and the balance from the June 1 increases taken in the US and Canada recently.","In terms of membership, our renewal rates are fine. There's still some slight negative renewal rate impact from the US credit card conversion last year and we expect that to continue for at least a quarter or two and we continue to see increased penetration of our executive membership. In terms of number of members at Q4 end, at year end, at Q3 end, we started with Gold Star of 37.8 million and at the end of the quarter, at the end of the year, we had 38.6. Business primary was 7.4 at each period; business add-on, 3.4; total member households, 48.6 at third quarter end and 17 weeks later at fiscal year-end, 49.4 million. All told, cardholders were 88.9 million a quarter ago. And fourth quarter year end was 90.3.","At year end, paid executive memberships totaled 18.5 million, an increase of 274,000 since third quarter end, which is about 16,000 per week increase in the quarter. Executive members are about 38% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, at year end, business members renewed at 94%, Gold Star members at 89.3%, these are numbers for the US and Canada combined, which is over 80% of our company and total US and Canada 90.0%, and worldwide, 87.2%, a slight tick down of a tenth or two from the last quarter.","A lot of that, as I mentioned earlier, we believe relates to -- in the US, the conversion last June to the new credit card program and with auto rebuild and again, we expect that to continue to downtrend a little bit in the next quarter or two. While I'm on the subject of membership, I\u2019d like to spend a couple of minutes to respond to the many questions we get literally every day relating to concerns -- the following concerns.","One, the new member sign ups might be slowing. Two, that the average number of member households per location seems to be coming down a little. And three, that with the increasing overlap of people having both a Costco membership and an Amazon Prime account and the fact that more and more people are having groceries delivered by everyone, is this the beginning of something that will impact Costco.","As to new memberships sign up slowing, we believe it's virtually all related to timing, the timing of openings and the timing of two online new membership initiatives we undertook, one each in the past two fiscal years. For example, in the first three fiscal quarters of 2017, fiscal 2017, in these 36 weeks, we opened 16 new warehouses, including two openings with outsized sign ups, both in Asia, a new unit in each of Korea and Taiwan. Those were done last January. Each of these locations added almost 60,000 new members to our base. In Q4, we opened -- in these 17 weeks, we opened 12 new locations, three were large sign ups in Japan, Iceland and France.","Again, these three locations, each opened for only 5 to 15 weeks in the fourth quarter added a total of 180,000 members to our base, again an average of about 60,000 new members per building. So timing of those certainly impact the numbers in terms of averages. Conversely, when we look at openings that cannibalize the existing nearby locations, you'll add maybe a few thousand at the most new members at that new location, the result will drive an expected $80 million to $100 million of new annual sales in that market, but lower the average number of members for each building in that market by 10,000 or more.","The other timing issue, in the last two fiscal years, we've done two online new membership drives, each which added an average of around 200,000 members, one a little less and one a little more. The fiscal 2016 event occurred in February of \u201916, near the end of our second quarter. The fiscal 17 event occurred in August in the fourth quarter of this year. So again, timing played an issue with that.","One last data point, if I take all of the US and Canada locations and I exclude all the new openings and all locations that were being cannibalized, in many cases, by these new openings, the average number of members at these remaining locations grew year-over-year from the end of fiscal \u201916 to the end of fiscal \u201917 by approximately 4% year-over-year. So our view is that we're fine and hopefully that answers some of the many questions we've got on these questions.","As to the other question, as it relates to increased delivery options by everyone, is it impacting us and is it impacting our brick and mortar? A few comments. One, of course, our sales and our comps are strong and have even trended up. Two, our shopping frequency is strong and has also trended up. Three, our value proposition, we believe it's stronger than ever. Four, we're just getting started on some of the new delivery options of our own and I'll talk about that in a minute. And five, we're using online and the Internet to drive businesses both to e-commerce as well as in store. So stay tuned and we'll continue to discuss that in each quarter.","Before continuing down the income statement line items, a couple of updated stats on the Citi Visa card offering. Again, this began in Q4 of last year in June, about June 20 I believe. When the conversion to Citi Visa occurred in June of 16, there were 11.4 million co-branded cards or about 7.4 million accounts being transferred over to Citi. As of Q4 end, just over a year since the conversion, we now have 1.8 million new approved member accounts or about 2.4 million new cards, including about 270,000 new accounts during the past 17 weeks.","Overall, we're seeing the Citi Visa co-branded portfolio total spend higher year-over-year, both organically and from these new accounts. Despite the fact that we had a partial comparison to the conversion last year, since it was midway through Q4, it was still positive year-over-year to gross margin, SG&A and EPS as I mentioned that earlier. I should note though that we\u2019d anticipate the year-over-year comparisons to moderate of course as it did actually in Q4 as well to moderate starting with the first quarter.","Lastly, we continue to enhance the value proposition, not only of being a Costco member, but then being a Costco executive member and then even better at Costco executive member using the Citi Visa Anywhere card. I'll share a couple of new examples of that during the remainder of this call. Overall, in terms of conversion, usage and sign-ups for the card, all good at this point.","Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 15 basis points. As I do always, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We\u2019ll do four columns. The first two columns are year-over-year basis point changes for the third quarter. First column would be as reported and the second column would be without gas inflation. And then Q4 reported and Q4 without gas inflation. So those would be the four columns.","First line item would be core merchandising. In Q3, we reported improvement year-over-year of plus 7 basis points, without gas inflation, plus 20. This year, in Q4, minus 8 and minus 3. Ancillary in Q3 was plus 15 reported and plus 19 ex inflation in gas. In Q4, minus 1 and plus 1, 2% reward from executive membership, minus 2 and minus 4 in the third and fourth columns, plus 1 and zero. LIFO, minus 5 and minus 5 in Q3 and minus 9 and minus 9 in Q4.","Other, minus 7 and minus 7 in Q3 and the two columns for Q4, plus 2 and plus 2. So all told, on a reported basis, in Q3, 17 year-over-year, we were up 8 basis points, without gas inflation, up 23. And in Q4, on a reported basis, down 15 and without gas inflation, minus 9. Now, mind you, in these numbers, the Citi Visa impact, as I mentioned earlier, in Q4, was plus 14 on a reported basis and on -- without gas inflation. So if you look at that way, the minus 15 would be minus 29 ex that and the minus 9 would be minus 23 ex that.","Now, overall, as I mentioned, reported margins were 15 basis points down year-over-year and 9 ex gas and as I just mentioned, taking out the Citi Visa benefit, minus 29 and minus 23. Now, within that, the core merchandise component gross margin was lower by 8 reported, but 3 excluding gas. As I've shared before, the subcategories within our core gross margin, which is almost 80% of our sales within the warehouse, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were essentially flat year-over-year, notwithstanding the investing in price that we have done during the course of this, with food and sundries and softlines being up a little bit year-over-year and hard lines and fresh being down a little bit again investing in price.","Ancillary and other business gross margin was down a basis point, up a basis point ex gas inflation. In the quarter, higher year-over-year margin contribution in gasoline, hearing aids, business centers and travel was offset by lower year-over-year margin contribution in e-commerce, again investing in price as well as pharmacy lower margins year-over-year. LIFO, I already shared with you, the fact that we had a LIFO credit last year to the tune of $31 million versus zero this year, so year-over-year, that was the 9 basis point delta. And Hurricane Harvey, well, that was the net of two items, so I won\u2019t go through that one, but overall, margins were down relative to last year and we feel it's a function of our own initiatives to drive sales and enhance member loyalty and satisfaction.","Moving to reported SG&A, our reported SG&A year-over-year in Q4 was better or lower by 37 basis points and 31 without gas inflation, coming in at 9.97% for the year compared to 10.34% last year. Excluding the Citi Visa benefit, and again the Citi Visa benefit was 8 basis points benefit to SG&A year-over-year or lower. Again, I'll ask you to jot down those four columns, Q3 reported and Q3 without gas and then Q4 reported and Q4 without gas. In terms of core operations, in Q3, plus 21 basis points and plus means good or lower and plus 9 without gas in Q4, plus 32 and plus 27.","Central, minus 1 and minus 3 and in Q4, reported and adjusted for gas, plus 8 and plus 7. Stock compensation, minus 1 and minus 1 and then in Q4, zero and zero. Other, minus 5 and minus 5 and then in Q4, minus 3 and minus 3. So reported Q3 lower or plus 14 basis points, reported and flat without gas inflation. And reported, plus 37 or lower by 37 basis points year-over-year and plus 31 or lower by 31 basis points ex gas. And again, each of those numbers, at 37 and 31, you could adjust -- you could look at it from the standpoint that 8 basis points came from the improvement year-over-year related to the Citi Visa card. And while that's been a great improvement each of the last four quarters as it was to margin, we'll start to see that benefit -- we\u2019ll still expect to see some benefit, but it will be greatly reduced after the first full year.","In terms of our SG&A performance in Q4, the operations component again was quite good. Strong top line sales frankly led to year-over-year improvement in payroll benefits and other items, particularly bank fees. Central expense was lower year-over-year by 8 basis points and 7 without gas. Again, we saw a nice improvement in payroll and benefit expense percentages, again offset very slightly by a basis point from IT modernization. And lastly, other was worse by 3 basis points that impacted negatively and that was the 11 million I mentioned earlier related to Hurricane Harvey.","And next on the income statement is preopening expense. Last year, in Q4, we had 24 million. This year, it was 6 million higher at 30 million. Last year, we opened 11 new units, 11 units, 10 that of relos, 2 of those 11 were international. This year, while we opened up only 1 more, 12 total, 6 were in international, international tend to have higher preopening. Overall, higher year-over-year preopening costs is really a reflection of higher penetration from international. All told, operating income in Q4 came in at 1.450 billion, up 259 million or 22% higher year-over-year than last year's results.","Below the operating income line, reported net interest expense came in at 53 million as compared to 39 million last year, primarily a result of the incremental new debt offering we did this past May in conjunction with a special dividend, which was discussed in last quarter's earnings call, plus there's one extra week in Q4 this year than last year. Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by 7 million, coming in at $22 million this year compared to 29 million last year. Within that number, actual interest income for the quarter was better year-over-year by 5 million, however, it was more than offset by that minus 12 million of FX related items I discussed at the beginning of the call.","Overall, pretax income was higher by 20% or 238 million higher in Q4, coming in at $1.419 billion this year. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q4 of 17 came in at 34.3% for the quarter compared to 33.6 last year. Again, as I mentioned during the call, we benefited from a few positive discrete items, tax items in both fourth quarters, but our -- but more last year than this year. Our effective rate for the entire fiscal year that we just ended came in at 35.36%. With that, reported net income was higher by 18%, coming in at $919 million this year compared to 779 million in net income reported last year in Q4.","Now, for a quick rundown of other topics. The balance sheet is included in today's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization in Q4 totaled $441 million. So for the entire year, depreciation of $1.370. Our accounts Payable ratio, if you recall last year, we were converting an ITR accounting system, so we paid an extra week of invoices early to make sure we wouldn\u2019t run into any snafus with that conversion on day 1 of the fiscal year that just ended.","But adjusting for that, last year, our accounts payable as a percent of inventories was 104%, reported was 85, but 104 taking the adjustment out. It came down to 98% at the end of this fiscal year. If you take construction payables out there and other types of payables that are not merchandise, last year's normalized number at year-end was 91, a little down at 89%, roughly 90% in both year-ends of last year on a merchandise only basis and normalized for that payables early.","In terms of average inventory per warehouse, this year fourth quarter end, it was about $12.28 million per location, last year, 11.85 million, so up about $430,000 per location. There is -- that's at the warehouse level. We've broken out this time the increase in inventories elsewhere, because we have quite a bit of expanded inventory with our expansion of e-commerce fulfillment locations and activities as well as some of the vertical integration things we're doing in those businesses.","In terms of CapEx, in Q4, we expended $779 million, which for all of 2017 would put us right at $2.5 billion, which is about the same as fiscal \u201916. We\u2019d anticipate spending to be a little higher in fiscal \u201918, not only as it relates to net increase -- relates to the sum of everything we do, not only openings, but also some manufacturing businesses that we\u2019re expanding as well as e-commerce and some other things.","Next, in terms of e-commerce, of course in the US, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan, you should expect additional countries to be open over the next year, year and a half. Total e-commerce sales in fiscal 2017 came in at 4.6 billion, up 15% from right at 4 billion at the end of our fiscal \u201816. For Q4, sales were -- profits were of course up. Total e-commerce sales were up 27% in the quarter. Of course, that includes an extra week, 17 versus 16 weeks and up 21% on a comp sales basis with a trending positive during the -- roughly four months of the quarter. As discussed over the past few quarters, much of our efforts over the past year focused on improving the functionality of our site.","We improved search, streamlined the checkout process, improved our members' ability to track their orders and automated much of the returns process and we also improved our online merchandising efforts by adding high end and well-known brand names, a few examples of late, Marmot, Spyder, ExOfficio, GE Appliances and Jiffy Lube Services. We've expanded our KS offerings. We're providing new hot buys, limited time offer with extra discounts.","We're also -- we\u2019ve started doing what we called Buyer\u2019s Picks and unique offerings to our partnership, Buyer\u2019s Picks and lastly some unique offerings through partnerships with Citi Visa, where we're offering in the cases we've done it with Samsung Electronics, we've done it with tires and a few other things where you buy it at Costco and you use your Citi Visa card on top of all the other great savings, there's anywhere from a 10% to 15% cash offer. And leveraging as well, we're leveraging our global brick and mortar buying power to expand and improve our online value proposition by lowering prices even further.","Lastly, we continue to build awareness on our site with Costco members through warehouse signage, special offers and targeted emails and expect us to discuss some of those activities more in 2018. We feel that all these efforts, which are ongoing have resulted in increased traffic in sales, both online and in-store during the past couple of quarters in particular. Looking forward, we\u2019ll continue to expand these types of activities to drive our businesses. You'll hear more from us in the coming quarters about driving online sales with ongoing site improvements, improved online marketing activities and of course along with great products and services at fantastic prices. That's what we do.","In terms of what's new, three days ago, we rolled out two new online delivery related offerings. The first, Costco grocery, which consists of nonperishable food and sundries items. This offers two day delivery on dry grocery and a second, an expanded white label same day grocery delivery offering through our partnership with Instacart that includes both dry and fresh grocery. You can find both sites by going to costco.com and then clicking on the Grocery tab. You'll then be taken to a page offering and explaining both of these new online delivery options.","A few details about each option. As it relates to Costco grocery, just under 500 dry grocery SKUs, again no fresh, free delivery with orders over $75, two day or less delivery throughout the continental United States, the boxes are up to 40 pounds shipment through UPS, orders are fulfilled at several of our business delivery centers. These offer very competitive pricing and value proposition, excuse me, in fact significantly better price than even we had at costco.com on many of these items. We\u2019d expect to expand these offerings overtime.","The second option, I mentioned, Instacart white label. This is currently offered at 376 of our US locations are live with it and there will be a number of additional US locations planned, added between now and the end of calendar \u201918 as our partnership expands. There are approximately 1700 SKUs, both dry and fresh that are offered and can be fulfilled through the Instacart white label option. Again, I mention that same day delivery and same day delivery, it's also a very competitive pricing value proposition, better than before and again, Costco members will now have access to our promotional pricing like on MVMs as well. Costco executive members will also receive the 2% reward and members utilizing the co-branded Costco Visa card will now earn that 2% on these purchases similar to in-store purchases. It\u2019s just starting this weekend and stay tuned.","Next on the discussion list here, warehouse expansion. For fiscal \u201917, we opened 26 net new units, about 3.5% square footage growth. For fiscal \u201918, we\u2019d expect to open about 25 net new warehouses, a little under two thirds of them in the US and about a third internationally as well we plan to relocate six warehouses to better located and larger facilities. That compares to two to three relos in each of the last several years. As of Q4 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 107.3 million square feet.","In terms of stock buybacks, in the first three fiscal quarters of 2017, over these 36 weeks, we expended $233 million to buy just under 1.5 million shares at an average price of $156.51, In Q4, these 17 weeks, we expended a little more than that 233, we expanded $240 million for about 1.5 million shares at an average price of 159.21 a share. So for the year, $473 million on stock repurchases, 2.998 million shares repurchased at an average price of $157.87.","In terms of dividends, our current dividend stands at $0.50 per share per quarter. That's up 11% from the previous quarterly amount. This yearly $2 per share annualized dividend represents a total payout from the company of approximately $880 million.","Finally, before I turn it back for Q&A, I\u2019ll discuss September sales results. For September, which is the five weeks ended this past Sunday, sales for the five week month were 12.4 billion, up 12.1% from the comparable five week period last year of 11.06 billion, they were up, sorry, yeah, they were up 12.1%. On a reported comp basis, September comp sales were up 8.9% and 6.2% after accounting for fluctuation in gas prices and FX. For September, our reported 8.9% comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of 4.1 and again that 4.1 of course includes the benefits from FX and gas at an average shopping frequency of 4.7% worldwide and within the 4.7%, a 5.4% in the US.","Gasoline price inflation and FX both contributed possibly in the month. Gas added 160 basis points while FX was favorable in the month by 110 basis points. Cannibalization impacted Canada in September by 325 basis points. As you know, we opened I believe 6 or 7 locations on a base of low-90s this year. So, a lot of cannibalization going on out there, while the US was negatively impacted by 60 basis points and other international by 155. So total company 110 basis points of impact in cannibalization. And as I -- not sure if I mentioned early, e-commerce, comp sales in the month were up 30%.","In terms of sales by geographic region, Texas and Midwest, both low double digits were strongest with California and the southeast regions being in the 7% range. Internationally, in local currencies, better performing countries were Japan, Mexico and the UK. In terms of merchandise categories for September, within food and sundries, tobacco, candy and cooler were the leaders. Tobacco of course, we've anniversaried back in June some of the big declines and we're seeing some strength since that point.","For hard lines, which was up low double digits, strongest department results were lawn and garden, automotive, tires, consumer electronics and toys. Softlines, which were up in the mid-single digits, housewares, small appliance, domestics and apparel showed strong results, strongest results and in fresh foods, comp sales which were in the mid-single digits again consistent pretty much across most -- all four -- main categories.","Within ancillary, gasoline again had very strong comps in the month, driven by both high, both price inflation and the cost of a gallon of gas as well as strong comp gallon growth. In addition, hearing aids were up in the teens and optical was not far behind.","Lastly, before I turn it back for Q&A, our fiscal 18 first quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12 weeks first quarter ending on November 26th, these will be reported after market close on Thursday, December 14 with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 o'clock Pacific time.","With that, I\u2019ll be happy to answer questions and I'll turn it over back to Christie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","I wanted to ask one on membership and I want to ask another on gross margins. So first on membership. The renewal rates have been moderating a little bit and there\u2019s been some explanation behind it, I think there was some credit card friction. And then regarding -- and I'm just curious if that's still the case or what's going on there. And as part of that, the membership growth, can you talk to the composition in the US versus international?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Well, again, in terms of renewal rate, we believe the biggest issue is the auto bill. When we look back at Canada, which occurred a year and a half, two years prior the conversion up there, from its peak renewal rate, I think all the way back to early fiscal \u201915, if I looked out six quarters, it came down about a full percentage point. It's now actually a tenth of a percent above where it was a year -- that year earlier at its peak. So -- and when I look at the -- we\u2019re now 4.5 quarters into it, not 6 and it's down \u2013 again, it was down a full percentage point in the US and recognize it's a little bit different scenario with conversion, but it's down about seven-tenths of a percent.","So we believe that's what it is. We don't -- when we look at -- we talk to the members of marketing people and we ask them about what are the reasons when somebody doesn't renew, we get consistent answers of what they've heard for the last several years. So our view at this point is that we're not seeing, we're not concerned about it and want to see what happens over the next couple of quarters if after that it doesn't change. But we assume it will at this point.","And I'm sorry \u2013","Simeon Gutman","If you just look at the overall membership, trying to dissect what the US run rate is or how is, I guess, same unit membership trends, I guess if you can try to take out cannibalization, just the direction and what the trend line has been in the US?","Richard Galanti","Well, in the US and Canada, which again is 80% of our company, 80 plus percent of our company, it was four. We just did that because we're getting the question every day. We can look at it. I don't have it off -- we didn't do that. We actually was -- we're trying to respond to some of the many questions. I think internationally, particularly since you've got newer units internationally, particularly in Asia and Australia, which is where your impact, less so in Mexico and UK where it\u2019s older, my sense is you'll see the same thing. It will be a positive, but greatly affected by cannibalization.","When you've got, in a city in Taiwan, where you've got two very high volume units, which with well over 60,000 members per warehouse and you open up a new one, you're still going to get a lot of new openings, not a lot of new members relative to what we see here, but my guess it's still -- that's going to cause it to come down. So again, it has more to do with timing than anything, cannibalization than anything. I just don't have beyond that. Canada and the US are pretty similar.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then my follow-up was on gross margin and I don't expect you to give a clear answer, because I don't think you give a lot on the outlook, but trying to think of price investment in particular, right, but there's been a pretty favorable trend up until this quarter and I think you said down 3 ex fuel. So I guess, how do you think of the price investment? I know, it's constant for the business, but you'll have some tough compares as you head into the next year, both on a gross margin and an overall EBIT growth perspective. So how do you think of that as the next several quarters play out?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, in a couple of words, we're fine. I think what we saw this fiscal quarter in terms of sales growth cures a lot of things and driving it with value, we've had the good fortune of having better than expected economics from our new credit card and we certainly -- we are just starting the benefit, if you will, to the membership fee line item, which will start -- continue over the next 20-ish quarters, 20-ish months as the fee increase in the US and Canada. That is again -- that's a fee increase that's about $240 million, peaking 12 months after we started. It takes 23 months because the deferred accounting get in there. So, there's plenty to go around and our view is that we can do both and we feel quite good.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks, Richard.","Richard Galanti","Let me add one last comment on that, I forgot to mention. The big chunk of it also is penetration of gas. Gas, while gas was great year-over-year, profitability is great. It's a much lower margin business, it's 9 plus percent of our total sales at 500 to 700 less margin -- basis points of margin. So when you've got huge increasing sales price per gallon and 10 plus percent sales growth on 10% of your business, and that aid into it as well. I'll take that lower margin percentage every day for 40-ish million of profits in the quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Richard, on the metric you provided about 4% membership per club growth ex cannibalization in the US and Canada, is it just a coincidence that that's kind of in line with where your traffic has been trending over the last couple of quarters or should we think about it as your traffic growth is highly correlated to that membership growth ex-cannibalization?","Richard Galanti","I think they're separate. I mean, a lot of times, I'll give you a simple example. Here in the Seattle region, we have three locations on the east side of the lake, Issaquah, which is across the street from where I am; Kirkland, which is where we used to be and Woodinville, all three kind of aligned north to south on the east side of this Puget Sound. Last November, we opened Redmond, which is where of course Microsoft is headquartered and basically, I think we had as of opening, less than 1000 new sign ups at the Redmond location because we have close to 80% household penetration in the Puget Sound, which is extreme.","This is where we're headquartered and we've been forever. We\u2019ve taken the average number of members per location, down from the mid-60s to the low-50s by just adding a new unit, but we\u2019ll add 80 million to 100 million in sales in the first year in this market. So when you've got locations that are doing 250 to 300 plus per unit, you've got to cannibalize them. So, I mean that's an example of that. So I don't think the two are correlated.","Michael Lasser","Okay. Just thinking about the comp frequency or the frequency component of your comp, it would seem some of your most longstanding members are probably going to Costco about as much as they can, so is it that the newer members are building their frequency and that's where the bulk of the frequency across your population is growing? Are you seeing growth in frequency across your entire population of members?","Richard Galanti","I think it\u2019s over the entire population. First of all, new members -- every new member is going to presumably be more frequent every year for several years. I believe that some of the things we're doing, I didn't give an example on the call here but we've done several e-mail initiatives to members to drive them in-store. We did it over the holidays with New York Strip Steaks at $6.99. We did it with Copper River salmon over just a very limited, I think a ten or so day period. These are little things that little anecdotal things, but we think that we keep doing things to drive even more frequently as well. So I would bet that most of it, since the bulk of our sales come from the numbers that are more than a year, more than two years and more than three years, we're getting them in as well.","Michael Lasser","My final question is on September\u2019s frequency growth of 5.4%. There's obviously a lot of moving pieces within landscape in September between the hurricanes, you also had Amazon closed on its acquisition of Whole Foods and there was a lot of noise around that. If you look at your clubs around Whole Foods, was there any impact and what do you think drove such strong frequency growth in September?","Richard Galanti","Mel Brooks once said it's merchandising. It\u2019s value and merchandising and some of the other little things we're doing here. As it relates to the tragic things of the hurricanes in Texas and Florida and Puerto Rico, frankly, you get a bill -- whenever there's a pending tragedy that's on the news every day, with this pending tragedy like a hurricane, you get a build-up in sales leading up to it. You're closed for a few days perhaps or more in a couple of locations, but when we look at it -- as I think I mentioned, the comp sales in Texas in September was one of the stronger regions. Now, that's partly because the entire state wasn\u2019t impacted by it. So we don't think that was a big impact at all. As it relates to the publicity and the news and the noise around Amazon Whole Foods, all we can do is perform. When we look at the value proposition, our view is our value proposition got better. You read about Whole Foods having giant increase in member shops or customer shops that first week. I would hope they do and I would expect them to.","There's a lot of news out there and there's a lot of things. When we've done our own, we've read about the price changes that the lowering of prices gives us more confidence that our value is even greater. So we\u2019ll have to wait and see and nobody can predict everything. All we know is that our brick and mortar is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and trending in the right direction from there.","And we know we've done a lot of, there's 100 different things you do every day. I gave you a couple of the sound bites, the example. So again at this point, we feel pretty good about what we're doing. We feel good that we've got a few delivery Options for our members that frankly are better than the ones they were doing the day before with us or with Instacart or with anybody else. So we feel that to the extent that somebody wants to choose -- to use that route, they'll be able to and we\u2019ll be able to generate the sales from it.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So Richard, I just want to start on SG&A leverage. Right. So both operations in Central, this was about I think as good a quarter as you've had in a long time. Extra week play any role in that? And maybe a little more detail on particularly operations because that you\u2019re down 27, you think about wages, benefits?","Richard Galanti","The only benefit is it\u2019s one-sixteenth more of our earnings number. I mean I guess you would have taken that 208 and divided by 17 weeks, but there's not a week with no rent expense in it, because we prorate that daily.","John Heinbockel","Yes. So I mean, if you think about it, you sort of -- you think about a sea change here, right, because you\u2019ve typically been up in Central and now down and again, you were down quite a bit more than the third quarter. What is different -- what was different fourth quarter versus third? I'm just curious what was different, how sustainable that is?","Richard Galanti","Well, it\u2019s sales. I mean, we hope it\u2019s sustainable. We\u2019ve got a lot of good things going on, but we\u2019re only a little bit better predictor than you guys are at that. We feel good about the initiatives we got going on. We feel good about the monies we have to invest in price and to still drive the other line items of our income statement. And \u2013","John Heinbockel","All right. Then just on the openings, right? So it sounds like maybe 8 or 9, 7 or 8 outside the US. Is that sort of 2 Canada and maybe 6 or 7 other international, and then where in other International?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019ll tell you. Yeah. I mean basically, a couple in Canada, two or three, a couple, four or five between the three countries in Asia and another one probably in Australia. That's generally where they are.","John Heinbockel","Okay. And then just one last thing, when you think about your delivery options here, what's your sense as to how customers will use those and alter their behavior? Right? So you think about the non-perishable food and sundries on the 2-day, do people simply get, do you think they\u2019ll get those delivered to the home and then come in to buy fresh and nonfood, some of the treasure hunt items and not to have their cards loaded with some of those sundries? How do you sort of get comfort about the impact on traffic to what you're doing?","Richard Galanti","Well, needless to say, we have to continue to watch that. We\u2019ve had some limited experience with our relationship with Google starting a few years ago and with Instacart over the last couple of years. What we found so far is it's more fill-in than replacement of a shop and the key is, if you come down a couple or three shops a year, one way as you add several more shops as fill-in or alternative, that's what we saw, but we have very little time and data to feel comfortable about where it will go.","We had to keep getting you, we want to do both of course, but we have to keep getting you in store because you're going to buy more and you\u2019re going to see more even if we had everything online, but we don't of course. And one of these I mentioned was, how do we get you in-store. We're just literally scratching the surface of any type of targeted Internet -- e-mail marketing initiatives. We have a very, as you know, a very loyal, hopefully you\u2019re one of them, a loyal member. And we're just scratching the surface with thinking about how to get you in store as well more often. And on the few examples, and several examples that we tried, it's great and we\u2019ll have to see how that goes.","I guess the one question that none of us know is [indiscernible] home and order stuff, recognizing you've got to pay for it and no matter who ultimately and there will be several of the lowest cost supplier provider delivering to you at home, there are people that actually want to go out, there are people that actually want to go touch their fresh foods and decide, pick it themselves and it's going to change over time. There's going to be an increasing percentage of online and online delivery and the question is, in brick and mortar, we even asked for years, well, how can you drive sales if you're not offering as many alternatives and whatever else. We've done it with value, in our case, value first and foremost is quality and low price. Over time, the percentage of delivery of fresh will change, how much so, we'll have to wait and see.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan.","Chris Horvers","So first question just on the SG&A front. Can you talk about, the IT headwind was small from a basis point perspective, but of course, the overall top line has accelerated. So as you think about the IT modernization on that central expense line, the underlying dollars, is that dollar growth year-over-year decelerating at this point or when do you think that dollar growth actually decelerates?","Richard Galanti","Basically, I think we're in the middle of that. I think it was a quarter or two ago where we actually, it was lower year-over-year by a basis point, and I said, that's on an inflection point. Certainly, even this 1 or 0 basis point this quarter was helped greatly by sales growth. It's going to still increase. I think part of it is where -- we're right at or about to enter our fifth year of modernization. So, that line will start getting fuzzier and fuzzier. We certainly added things to what we are modernizing, taking major systems and doing that we had not contemplated at first.","And so my guess is in the next year, assuming regular decent sales, as a percent of sales, a lot of these systems, you spend $60 million or $100 million on one system, it\u2019s kind of like building a building, you start appreciating the day open or the day you turn it on. And it was probably three to four years ago that we started turning a system on in that regard as we complete them.","So it will be another year before we've got, if you will, the plate full with these bigger expenses that then amortize over generally five to seven years. So but as sales grows, the denominator in this calculation grows, that will be an offset to it. So I'm shooting from the hip here and as a guest, but all things being equal, sometime in the next year, there is maybe an inflection point, but it's going to be in the one or two basis points either way hopefully and at some point here, we\u2019ll stop talking about it.","Chris Horvers","Okay. And then you said on the Visa benefits, the gross margin, SG&A, you\u2019ve said the word, used the term moderate, but not go away. So I think the last quarter, you talked about that sort of -- we're going to start to lap that guys and that's going to go away. So is it just moderation or does it go away and is that \u2013","Richard Galanti","Well, it\u2019s a moderation with a capital M. I think in the first three quarters this fiscal year, the sum of the benefit of improvement to SG&A and margin was 37 or 38 basis points. The aggregate in Q4 was 22. And mind you, a year ago, in Q4, you had a lot of things happening. You were getting off the old program and there was some detriment to that in those last several weeks anyway, the first five weeks of Q4. Then, you had it, but there was also some noise and friction around getting the conversion done for two or three weeks. So my guess is, it will be a much -- it should improve because we're seeing increased penetration of usage.","We're seeing increased revenue shift from people saying the value of this card and not only at Costco, but their top of wallet. I forgot if I mentioned it on my part of this call, but using travel as an example. We just added Costco travel to the executive member, first of all, effective September 1, so you get 2% on travel, which you hadn\u2019t gotten before. On top of that, if you use your Costco co-branded Visa Anywhere card, Citi Visa card, you get another 3% by using that on travel. So there's a 5% off unbelievable prices.","Chris Horvers","Understood. And then last thing is, you did do -- you talked about the timing in the Groupon, January or earlier and then in August. Can you talk about what the rationale was to do in August? I think a lot of people look out there and say, hey, they see this growth in membership slowing, so sort of a desperation pass to the end zone to buffer the numbers and to the print. So maybe just talk about what the genesis of that was, does it make you -- is it an expression that you're concerned about millennial retention or millennial customer acquisition, just talk broadly about that.","Richard Galanti","No, I mean I think first of all, we did it because it works. We don't do it every month or every six months because we don't want to get people comfortable waiting for the next online offering with that added value, with added giftback, gifts in them. We want them to sign up as a member and pay for it. And so it works, the timing difference is simply, we have a lot going on. I believe if I recall, if I look back, we did the fee increase effective June 1 and we didn't want to do it over that month or two period of time. So we pushed it out a little bit.","Chris Horvers","And then just from what you've seen in terms of the millennial customer from a renewal rate perspective on these deals going back in time?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Going back to your question though, you asked, do we do it because of concern about millennial, I don't think we're smart enough to understand that. The fact is we do it just to drive membership, we recognize that it has a good millennial benefit. I don't have the one on the one that we just did, but the one we did a year and a half ago and what we did like 2.5 and 3 ago, versus a walk-in, a higher percentage of people that sign up on these LivingSocial or Groupon offers are millennials, not as much as you'd expect and I think it's walking in if I recall correctly.","It is like mid \u2013 39% of those that walk in this last one were millennials. I think I\u2019ll go back to the previous one, it was 36% were walk-ins or millennial, whereas millennials under this program, it was like in the mid to high-40s, so about 10 extra percentage points. So not a huge distortion or a difference between those two. But it helps.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays.","Karen Short","Actually, just on the subject of millennials. Wondering, can you maybe just give us an update a little bit on the average age of your membership? I know, you kind of give that periodically. It seems to have been trending down, any color you can give on that.","Richard Galanti","I don't have anything in front of me. I know that what we did a couple of \u2013 not a couple of years, about a year ago, it was looking at US numbers, it was 52 years versus 54 years across the US, not the entire population of US adults, which was about, so we were two years older instead of a few years earlier than that, we were four years older. I have not seen anything since that. If I have a \u2013 you can ask me, I\u2019ll find out, but I don\u2019t recall.","Karen Short","Okay. And then one other question I think you were asked, and I didn\u2019t catch the answer, if you gave it. But do you have any color just specifically on the performance of your stores that are in close proximity to Whole Foods since the price reduction were -- took place at Whole Foods.","Richard Galanti","Yeah. We essentially overlap everywhere. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute, but other than reading about it on the news and the paper on Wall Street, we have not seen -- we recognized \u2013 I read yesterday that there are some specialties brick and mortar retail stores that are impacted more than others. We don't believe we\u2019ve seen an impact from it.","Karen Short","And then I guess on the online grocery, I just want to clarify. You gave 1700 SKUs and I think what you said was that possibly, the price points will possibly be cheaper than Costco, did I catch that right and then --?","Richard Galanti","No, no. It will be lowered. Currently, you could go to certain other parties, Google Express, Instacart as was before Octobe1, costco.com Costco Business Center and limited delivery within the 40 or 70 mile radius of those 15 locations, shipped down in the southeast, I believe, boxed. And I'm sure there are some others out there that I\u2019m missing. When we look at the pricing that anybody, both a member and a non-member as the case may be depending on each one, how they price their goods, what they're ultimately have -- what their delivery prices, this is better, including on some of the items which you could buy at great value and better value than those areas on costco.com already.","Karen Short","Got it. Okay. And then just a last question, there seems to have been some rumblings that you\u2019re looking to expand into China, I don\u2019t know if you could comment on that a little bit.","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s the 20-year discussion as we're looking. As a rule, until we have permits to do something, building permits to do something, we don\u2019t announce whether it's in Alabama or China and, but we're looking and at some point, we'll announce something.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Richard, my first question relates to the line item that talks about core margin categories on their own sales and I guess that line item, this is inclusive of gas and I might not have caught the number ex-gas, have been up for the first \u2013","Richard Galanti","It's exclusive of gas.","Matt Fassler","Okay. So only in core categories. That number had been up I think each quarter of the year and in fact, I think had been up something like 11 straight quarters. Last time it was down I think was in that -- 10 straight quarters -- second quarter of fiscal \u201915 and I know it was flat this quarter and the differences are not very big, but it was a bit of a break in the pattern. So was there any particular area where you invested in price and was there a concerted effort to invest to a greater degree in price that would have led to the increases in that line item data here?","Richard Galanti","Yes. But again -- honestly, we don't sit down. We decide like here is a bucket of money, if you will, and how we're going to use it. We don't do a bunch of sensitivity analysis of it. We\u2019re merchants and I\u2019m not, but they are here and we look at what are the things that drive business in retail grocery, or retail non-food as a case maybe and certainly on key items, I think I used the example of New York Strip Steaks where we were $7.99 and $8.99, which \u2013 we went down to $6.99. And by the way, we did that and still made a decent margin because of how we bought it on, we're a giant buyer of this stuff. We've done it on several items and it works. So I think the point you made though is, while it's not a lot directionally, it's different. That's fine. We're really not concerned about that.","Matt Fassler","Fair enough. And then secondly, so Instacart, I know, is a prominent delivery partner. I know that prior to Amazon acquiring Whole Foods, Whole Foods had made an equity investment in Instacart, does that have any impact on that partnership on the future of -- and obviously you're not the only partner Instacart has and there is probably a question a lot of their business partners are having, is that a relevant consideration at all as we think about this forward for Instacart?","Richard Galanti","No. In fact, what we announced, when we initiated this week our discussions both before and after that, but both before and after June 15 or 16.","Matt Fassler","Great. And then finally, the e-commerce business, I know, has accelerated over the past few months and you spoke about the last couple of quarter about some of the changes that you made, re-platforming, et cetera and the capacity you have. Are there any particular categories where you're seeing that acceleration to the extent that you\u2019ve kind of more than doubled the pace of growth in e-commerce, I know you're not doing fresh obviously and you're expanding your e-commerce efforts with some of these brand new initiatives, but anywhere in particular where the business is taking off.","Richard Galanti","Well, on the non-foods side, I think we mentioned a quarter or two ago, appliances is a big area. Apparel \u2013 on the non-foods area, [indiscernible] sundries. So we continue, I think, to do a better job on the things on the food and sundry side, on the dry food and sundry side and some big ticket items. And then, I look at some of the examples, again, it was only for what one or two week period, the Samsung deal with using the Citi Visa card on top of great pricing on the TV to start and white glove service if you want it, it was -- you got our great price and if you\u2019re an executive, remember, you got 2% and have used the Citi Visa card, you not only got a 2%, you got that 2% because you bought at Costco. On top of that, you got a 15% cash card. And that impacted sales, both in line -- in store as well as online. So, these are sound bites, but there's lots of them.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","First on membership. I believe the last LivingSocial deal that you ran in 2016, you signed up approximately 250,000 new members through that program or so, could you discuss what the more recent program led to in terms of sign up and then also, the number you gave early on call in terms of the 4% growth in the US and Canada, ex-cannibalization, what would that number be all in, even if we included the club that did see some cannibalization or just kind of overall US maybe versus international growth in membership per club.","Richard Galanti","Yeah. I don't have it. I was trying to be helpful to the \u2013 one of the things I guess I want to warn, we're not going to start doing this new calculation every quarter. We try to be helpful here, but we know based on our discussions every day, we can, at the budget meeting, that we felt that we're fine when the question's been asked about the average number of members who are all seems to be going down. The new, total new member signups seems to be \u2013 the rate of growth seems a bit slow a little bit. Again hopefully, the data points I gave you lay those concerns. But I don't have the detail beyond that. What we did is we took, let\u2019s take all the cannibalized units, we know that's a bigger impact and all the new units that many of them are in small markets. That's an impact. That\u2019s going to impact it.","Paul Trussell","Understood. And on the LivingSocial sign ups?","Richard Galanti","It was a little better than the one 18 months earlier.","Paul Trussell","Fair enough. And then just on gross margins, you mentioned at the beginning of the call, the benefit, the pretax benefit had been netted out to about 10 million or so. What line item within gross margins did that impact and also just wanted to enquire what if any margin impact you are assuming from the new Costco grocery rollout?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. On the first one, I think it was a separate line item called other. That was the 2 basis points. And as it relates to the impact of the new thing, it\u2019s going to be so small to start with, we don't even know yet.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then just so, on that point, as we think about gross margins over the near term, is it fair that we should think that there could, maybe flat to slightly down would be kind of the near term run rate, just given investments in price that you've made and the moderating contribution from Visa.","Richard Galanti","Well, we don't guide. Visa will be moderating, but moderating still has a plus sign in front of us, even if it's small. I look back though as we still have a chunk of those monies, we still have -- we have the new membership fee increase that started in June, with -- again ultimately it's $240 million that increase in just the US and Canada that will hit the P&L, but the total benefit to the P&L line won\u2019t be for 23 months from June. So that\u2019s May of 19. So, but there is plenty of money out there to do both, to be able to \u2013 when the margins go up or down a little bit, again, I get back to it, it is merchandising. We feel we've got plenty of capacity. I think that the salient point is, is any of this related to competitive issues out there? For the most part, no. It's us.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Gordon Haskett.","Charles Grom","Could you just remind us the profitability of your digital business relative to the club segment and also the SKU overlap between both and what you think the long term opportunity is for the SKU count on the digital side?","Richard Galanti","E-commerce profitability is a higher percentage of pretax earnings as a percent of sales in the brick and mortar, but there are a lot of things like that. Some of the ancillary businesses are that way, but it has continued. If it's come down a little, it\u2019s simply because we've invested in price and I would say whatever investment in price is, that number of basis points is less than the reduction in the profitability of e-commerce, because we've driven e-commerce profitability.","Charles Grom","Okay. And is that mostly on the merch margin side or has it been on the SG&A side?","Richard Galanti","A little of it is SG&A, little of it\u2019s margins.","Charles Grom","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Chris\u2019 question earlier about the millennials, could you speak to membership trends and renewal rates for that category or for that cohort of individuals?","Richard Galanti","I don't have any new data on that other than I think what I shared last quarter. Millennials, new members generally renew at a lower rate. Every year, you're stuck around, you're going to renew at a better higher rate until you're really old. And millennials linear renew at about the same rate, at least that\u2019s always, it offers your members. Yeah. And in fact, I remember, I don\u2019t have the detail on the one we just did, but the one we did 18 months ago versus walk-in, we saw those that signed up on LivingSocial renewed at like a percentage point higher rate in that first year of renewal. But again that's plus or minus a little.","Charles Grom","Okay. And then just my last question is obviously the compression in your renewal rates and the timing of the Amazon Whole Foods deal has sort of given a lot of people concern and there's obviously a focal point on the call and I wanted to circle back to Simeon\u2019s question earlier, in your answer to his question with regards to Canada, because I think it gives you a good proxy for sort of a pathway for the renewal rate subsequent to the change in tender. So could you just remind us and just go over that again. You said that peak to trough was around 100 basis points from the time you rolled out that new credit card and what was the recovery time and therefore you think it's going to be another quarter or two before your renewal rates ticked up, can you just kind of discuss that because I think it\u2019s pretty important?","Richard Galanti","Yes. And mind you, there's still some differences and nuance differences between Canada and the US, but notwithstanding those differences, Canada, I think we did the transition in early fiscal \u201915, September of \u201914, which was Q1 of \u201915 and we were in Canada. And then if I look out six months later, it dropped -- it continue to drop for six quarters and it dropped exactly -- and I mean \u2013 but it dropped 1.0 percentage points.","The next couple of quarters, it ticked up half of the delta and it took another couple of quarters to pick up all of the delta. Another quarter plus to pick up the rest of the delta. This year, we did -- we converted in Q4 of \u201816. So we're now in the fourth quarter past that, whereas, I saw the trough in Canada, albeit some differences and nuances, six quarters out. So that would tell me, it's probably a couple of more quarters, but that\u2019s about as much analysis as we've done.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen & Company.","Oliver Chen","Richard, as you do think about e-commerce and you become much more aggressive and considerate about what your strategies are, what are your thoughts about the framework for balancing e-commerce and the convenience factor against margins and cost control from a CapEx and expense perspective, what\u2019s your framework for how you're thinking about evaluating where you should allocate ROIC for the long term.","And our second question was just about the value proposition story, which continues to be very compelling. How are you triangulating the value proposition against core merchandise margin and also working through with vendors in terms of maximizing it for the whole system and sharing and passing on some savings to customers. And that's also a little bit related to the multi-vendor Mailer and where you are with that project? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","It's all of the above. First of all, in terms of allocation, first of all, the base e-commerce as we\u2019ve gone to more fulfillment centers, we frankly -- it\u2019s been a net positive because we\u2019ve driven down transportation costs, freight costs, we've driven down time to get it to you. The improvements, the costs of the improvements to the site are de minimis. It's just that perhaps we were a little stubborn for a long time and we hadn\u2019t done it. It wasn\u2019t our focus, but improving search, improving the site itself, expanding distribution points, those are small pieces of a $2.5 billion CapEx budget.","So I don't really see that, we've got more than enough money to do it. As it relates to driving business, some of these things are text clearly. Someone else earlier asked the question, what if this thing with grocery is really successful. Well, really successful is two things. It's really successful as a business and how does it impact the people coming into -- walking into Costco, because we know we're going to buy really a lot more stuff when they walk in. So we have to do that and we think we can manage that by using email to drive people in store as well and the couponing and things like that. So again, time will tell and we\u2019ll have to see where it goes.","As it relates to working with vendors, it's pretty simple. Based to the volume and the efficiencies that we bring to purchasing a product from a vendor, we better get the best price and we all hear and sometimes we read and sometimes somebody accidentally sends us something, but we all hear about all the special deals out of one retailer, whether brick and mortar or someone else. I think like all of us out there, we have to keep our options open, but we feel pretty good about we\u2019re getting money.","Some of the successes we've had, whether it's the special deals and the example of the special deals, working with vendors on hot items and the Buyer\u2019s Picks, when I spoke about last February or early March in the second quarter earnings call about, in some cases, tweaking some types -- differently tweaking how we use the MVM and what I was doing with, how we drive greater value and sometimes partnering with the vendor to do that, all those things are part of the equation. I think it's a lot easier for us to do it when we're trying to manage a few thousand items at the enormity of purchasing power we have within those items and the availability of sourcing those items from many people.","So I think we feel pretty good about what we're doing and how we're getting the monies and how we\u2019re spending them, and there's a lot going on. We\u2019ll have to wait to see. We\u2019re gratified that the things we're doing are driving brick and mortar traffic and comps and we're gratified by some of the things that we were telling you over the last few quarters of earnings calls about improving the site, adding a few things, have started coming to fruition on e-commerce. We think some of these new things, we're excited about it, but there's a lot of unknowns yet.","A comment from somebody in the room here mentioned, I think appliance is a great example. It used to be, we sold some appliances in-store and other big ticket items like furniture. And if you know we don't deliver and you\u2019ll get your U-Haul or your pickup -- your friend\u2019s pickup truck, well, that\u2019s not happening today. By displaying some items in store, we're driving more business, we're doing very well online with furniture, with patio furniture, with regular furniture, with lawn and garden type big ticket items, with electronics, including white glove service and now with appliances. We think appliances, part of it also is brands, having partnerships with GE and LG and Samsung among others, which are relatively new in the way we're doing it, we think in literally three or so years, we can add $1 billion of sales, which we\u2019ve started doing about 8 months ago.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","You mentioned the manufacturing facilities during your prepared remarks. Can you talk a little bit more just about what you've done there and what kind of the strategy is and some of the benefits you see when you start to take some of that stuff in-house? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well that's a continuation of some things we've done. Years ago, we opened our first ground beef plant, I think it was originally in Tracy, California and the intention was -- is to one, assure supply and two, by definition have great quality, but in two, lower the price per pound of landed ground beef to our locations. We did that and more. We now have a plant in California that supplies us. It's our planet, 4 plus million pounds a week, over half a dozen SKUs. We're building a second plant on the East Coast right now because this one has been beyond capacity for a few years, but we now can accommodate one in the East Coast and by the way reduce some freight costs along the way, so we\u2019ll get more efficiencies from that.","The $300 million we're spending on a chicken plant in Nebraska just broke ground a month or two ago. We need over 400 million birds in the US every year. This will be less than about 100 million, so just under a quarter of our need. More importantly, we've got two other plants run by other well-known suppliers where we, we call them dedicated facilities. We had to retrofit them, greatly reduce the number of SKUs they\u2019re supplying and manufacturing to supermarkets, restaurants and us and other clubs and driving, guess what, if you are to greatly reduced the SKUs, you make the manufacturing more efficient, you can save, given the weak and given what happens with all the byproduct and the markets themselves, we can guarantee sourcing and lower our costs by anywhere from $0.10 to $0.35 a bird depending on what month and what's going on out there in the markets.","So it has worked well for us. We're looking to do that and other things and the fact that we source produce from 44 countries, it's what's make -- it is what makes us who we are, but we're sourcing 30 SKUs or so, not 150 SKUs. We\u2019re building -- in Canada, we\u2019ve built a commissary for baking these. We've got \u2013 so we\u2019ll continue to do that, but I think the biggest single commitment we've made is this new chicken plant, but it's not likely gone from zero to 300 million in this example. We've done a lot of things.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","I know we're late, but I wanted to just kind of attack the elephant in the room. We\u2019ve had a lot of questions on kind of memberships and I think the elephant in the room basically, it's the old Peter Lynch of investing, invest in what you know and I think a lot of people in the investment community have seen, if they\u2019re Costco members, maybe have seen that their shopping frequency to Costco drop as Amazon's come in with things like subscribe and save and other programs that they've done.","So Richard, what I wanted to, I mean, clearly, your sales are just amazing, like they speed up and they speed up and they speed up in your frequency, what are we missing in the investment community, where again it's the old Peter Lynch thing kind of invest in what you know where our experiences, I think, collectively and I hear from a lot of investors, but I also have experienced myself in my own household, we're going to Costco less and yet, your sales are so darn strong, what are we missing and why do you think we're missing it.","Richard Galanti","I wish it was the easy explanation. We don\u2019t see it and that's not a good -- it's a good answer from the standpoint that we don't see it and that's good, it\u2019s in the numbers. To the extent, clearly, you've done some sampling yourself, Scott, others have as well. Some of that sampling shows what you just suggested that it appears that, including your family. Others, it doesn't show that. I don't know why. What we know is that we feel good, well, certainly, we feel good about comps and frequency and renewal rates, subject to the \u2013 to some of the credit card stuff. We feel good about some of the things we're getting ready to offer.","If this stuff is being sold out there at higher prices and now we're going to -- those prices are going to be even lowered further by us with one and two day delivery or with, the first, one day, same day delivery with fresh, we have to figure out how to communicate that to everybody. But that should continue to drive more business. We\u2019ll see. I don't have a good answer for that one. I think part of it is, if you take, using the supermarket grocery industry, the roughly whatever it is, 900 billion or $1 trillion industry, everybody out there on this call and elsewhere will have their estimate of what delivery and online will be as a percentage of the total. If whatever it is today, it'll be more tomorrow and it will be more the next day.","I think everybody, even though has extreme assumption is it\u2019s not going to be 100% ever. The question is, is it going to go from and making these numbers up from 5 to 10 and then slow down, is it going to go to 20 or 25, is it going to go to 40, who the hell knows. Whatever it\u2019s going to be, we should have a piece of it, but clearly, whatever that brick and mortar and people actually drive somewhere and get in themselves, I think we're going to keep taking pieces of that. An extreme example is not even on grocery, it\u2019s on apparel.","We have a six plus billion dollar apparel business that\u2019s compounded for 3.5 years at 9 plus percent, while the brick and mortar apparel is down. I know why and we've explained why. So for every point, there seems to be a counter point. Within grocery itself, part of it's the unique items, whether it's Kirkland Signature items or some of the things we do uniquely ourselves, all those things hopefully will get in.","If we can\u2019t get you to come in for it, we will at least get you to come in occasionally, buy some of the things we do that drive you it like the strip stakes or like the Copper River salmon or like organics and to the extent if you want to pay a little more, that little more will be a lot less more than it was the day before, even through us. So that's what we're going to do.","Scott Mushkin","Yeah. I mean I think right now, it seems like with the strength of the business, our experience maybe on the investment community is a little different than what's going on for a lot of people. Hey, I had just one last one on the $75 free delivery, I've been on the site during the call. If you sell items and you deliver for free for over $75 of the order size, are the profits equivalent there with going to the store and then thanks for letting the call go so long.","Richard Galanti","Repeat the question, somebody was mentioning something.","Scott Mushkin","Yes. So I mean basically, if it's $75, the delivery is free. What -- is the profit equivalent if I go over $75 and I buy on this Costco grocery, is the profit equivalent there versus the store?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Scott Mushkin","Yes. All right. Again thanks for taking my question. Thanks for letting the call go so long.","Richard Galanti","Yes. No worries. And part of that by the way is what we do. I mean it's a huge volume that we\u2019re doing, like any deliverer out there, including some of the ones that deliver our stuff and they\u2019re doing stuff third party with us, it's all about getting more things on the box. If we get you to maximize that shipment, that goes a big way. If we get the volume that we can bring to the table when third party shippers are also looking for more volume and to spread that volume, that's all good for us.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","On the topic of e-commerce, you talked about the higher profitability of an online sale. I'm just curious if you were to take a dollar of sales out of the club and transfer it to online, does the better profit online completely offset the deleverage of pulling that dollar out of the club.","Richard Galanti","It took me a long time before we figure that out. At the end of the day, if all we\u2019re doing is substituting and taking sales out of brick and mortar and doing it online, that's a loss and that's a money losing proposition. The fact of the matter is, if we're going to lose it, a, we should lose it to ourselves and b, can we drive more business anyway, both in-store and online. The fact that you can get under this Costco grocery dry items throughout the entire Continental United States within a year, 90% of it already, starting two days ago, that includes lots of geographies where there's not a Costco within 150, 200 miles.","So we think that we're going to drive some business outside of our existing members and by the way, they're going to come remember to do this. So they're really doing it despite ourselves online with a limited amount of things we had at a higher price. So we think that, will there be some, will somebody stop becoming a Costco member? Sure. There's going to be somebody. Will somebody shop less on in-store because they\u2019re now infilling or fulfilling some of that with buying direct? Yes. But, will there be new people that do it before? Absolutely. And will we figure out how to get you in the store even if you don't want to drive to the store? Yes. And we've been pleasantly surprised by some little things we've done to do that. People like deals and we do deals better than anybody.","Dan Binder","Second question was around renewal rates. You talked about the next couple of quarters possibly before you see that inflection. If I go back far enough, I can recall cycles where you had membership fee increases, where the renewal rate would come off a little bit, not a lot. I think the last cycle, you didn't see that. I'm just curious as you look -- because you just raised membership fees, is it possible that that renewal rate takes a little bit longer than just a couple of quarters until you lap that fee increase next year?","Richard Galanti","I think it's possible. I think what you're talking about originally though is when we do an increase, you'd see almost an immediate drop in renewal rate for about a year that it gets backed up and it\u2019s continuing on. I think it's been like, at least two, if not three cycles of 10 to 15 years prior to that when we saw that. Recognizing, there's other things that have made you want to renew your membership, having gas stations, having fresh foods, becoming the executive member, all those things have helped that as well. So it's hard to dissect it in that regard. Anecdotally, what we hear from -- again from membership and from membership when they survey members that have dropped that it has nothing to -- virtually nothing to do with raising the fee.","Dan Binder","Okay. Just two other questions. On the promotional front, if I go back a couple of quarters ago, it looked like you were pulling back on the MVM, hit the sales a little bit, but over the years, it\u2019s gotten a little bit more business on promotion, maybe a little less on EDLP, there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift, and now I'm just listening to the call today, it sounds like you're going to be more active online. So I guess just in terms of how it fits into the message to the customer about everyday low price and whether they should wait for that promotion, do you feel like you're -- you have the right balance today or do you think there will be further tweaks as you do more online, take away some of the MVM in the club?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, the letter E means every day. What we talked about -- what we changed back in February-ish, we\u2019ve continue. What I mentioned -- I gave a couple of examples what we\u2019ve done online of late. So it's not substituting something else. The view is -- our collective view is that there's -- we have the ability to do all the above and we're doing it.","Dan Binder","Okay. And then my last question was just around traffic, both I think in September and the quarter and I think actually for quite a while, the US traffic, or at least a couple of quarters, the US traffic has been better than international. I was just curious with a younger international store base, why would that traffic be softer? Is it strictly cannibalization or is it something more than that as you compare it to the US traffic growth?","Richard Galanti","I think it\u2019s two things. It\u2019s cannibalization and the newness of the \u2013 it\u2019s cannibalization and new members in any state or any country and that first renewal is less than the second year renewals, less than the third year\u2019s. So every time they renew, they\u2019re more likely to renew the next year at a higher rate than the previous year class if you will. And so we've got newer market units and we have cannibalization.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO.","Kelly Bania","Just a couple more questions on the two new online initiatives. I guess, first, how will the prices compare for each of them to the stores in the club. I believe Instacart has two different models, one where the prices actually matched the in-store prices, but I believe there's a margin impact for that for the retailer. So just any comments on how we should expect or what the message to members will be on how prices will be on the online versus in the club? And then are there any plans in terms of testing some more auto replenishment type programs along with this and any plans to market or advertise this in a meaningful way.","Richard Galanti","On the latter part, I believe there's something already on the site in terms of auto replenishment. That\u2019s over there. I\u2019m sorry, it does replenishment in terms of the list of based on you bought before. And again, yes, that will be tweaked, but that was first order business to get out there. First of all, in terms of Instacart having two different models, the same prices in store or not, I don\u2019t think they only have one model with us currently, prior to this week. And which included, however they charge for delivery or they markup our goods. So this will be lower when you go on to Instacart and even lower when you go on to Costco grocery or Costco e-commerce.","Did I answer that?","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","When you're looking at the various reasons people shop at the Costco clubs, are you able to look at just how much they enjoy their shopping experience, you've got great sales numbers and there's a lot of reasons to be in the store, but is there just a factor that indicates people enjoy being in the club.","Richard Galanti","Well, I\u2019m biased, but of course, we all enjoy being in a club. What was first part of your question?","Chuck Cerankosky","Well, you've got various reasons like saving money to go to a Costco club and high quality, but is there just flat out simply an experiential reason to be in the clubs that is driving traffic numbers that are better than a lot of other brick and mortar retail?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think it\u2019s several, well, Chuck and again, I am biased, it\u2019s several things. The gas station\u2019s help to fresh foods is second to none. And in our view, that\u2019s even got -- the amount around that has gotten bigger, not smaller since June. There's Kirkland Signature items, there's Treasure Hunt fresh. There's organics, I mean I think this is what we do. When I go to the budget meetings every four weeks and I look at even some of the things we've got coming in for the various holidays, whether it's outerwear, apparel for the winter or some of the holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas, just, I think our members are -- should be as excited as ever about some of the exciting new things we have.","They keep driving that value proposition. And all the things that I mentioned earlier in the call, the tweaking of the MVM, the -- using the emails to get you into buy, when everybody out there was $8.99 to $10.99 on choice, New York Strip Steaks, we went from $7.99 to $6.99. That not only drives business and it takes it away from chicken and ground beef, it drives traffic. And we know how to do that kind of stuff pretty well.","Chuck Cerankosky","Going back to membership, our work has been showing that household formations are looking a little better than the census numbers, which are about 1 million new households per year right now. Are you seeing that in membership sign ups in the US?","Richard Galanti","New households? I don't know. If you want to me email me the question, I can find out.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.","Rob Iannarone","Rob Iannarone on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just one housekeeping item. Organic sales, can you tell us how much that was for the year?","Richard Galanti","Organic? It was up a little over 20% and about 5.5 billion.","Rob Iannarone","Great. And one follow-up also food related here. Anything you're seeing changing in either inflation\/deflation, has the preliminary conversation changed with any of the suppliers you talk to?","Richard Galanti","It's pretty stable. I mean, everybody's hoping for a little -- well, we're not hoping for inflation, everybody's hoping for inflation. Again, it doesn't hurt us, but it's been pretty stable. I mean if I look at LIFO indices or any type of those metrics, we've gone from deflation to flat or literally low single digit basis points up on a basket. Taking gas out of the equation, which is quite inflationary right now.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman","Two quick ones. Pick up in store, I know we've talked about this before with you guys, but just curious if you\u2019ve changed your thinking on it at all or if there's any potential to do a test like a bottom line pickup in store situation.","Richard Galanti","Yes. We look at it, but at this point, we\u2019re not prepared to do it. We do with tires. You can order them online and schedule your appointment.","Joe Feldman","Got it. Is it a space issue or a labor issue you think?","Richard Galanti","Well, it's -- first of all, to tell you the truth, in our view and maybe we're stubborn, it's a common sense issue. You order and then you've gotten, we have separated, it's a dry refrigerated frozen wait for you and it's clearly a space issue. I mean, we're doing literally twice the volume of some others out there, two to three times the volume versus our two direct competitors and I'm sure at some point, we\u2019ll try it, but it's not on the agenda in the next couple of months.","Joe Feldman","Got it. And then the other topic, I think you said the store mix for this year, new stores was two-thirds US, one-third International, I feel like that you were trying to push more towards 50-50 the past couple of years, just anything to do that you can mention there.","Richard Galanti","We\u2019re still trying and just there's a longer pipeline and we\u2019ve had a lot going on. So there's, we will get there and I look at it and I think the good news is, if you had asked me five, six, seven years ago, I don't think we'd have as many opportunities in the US as we still think we have. I mean saturation continues, but that the time with saturation ultimately occurs for new locations, keeps -- being pushed out a little bit further.","Why don\u2019t we take two last questions?","Operator","Okay. We\u2019ve got two more questions left. The next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","David Bellinger","Hi. This is David Bellinger on for Brian. So my first question is on the price investments you detailed earlier. Just to be clear, did those step up in Q4 versus the trend over the first three quarters of the year and if so, was that in some way a reaction to the Amazon Whole Foods deal.","Richard Galanti","No. They didn\u2019t other than there\u2019s more weeks, there's 17 weeks versus the first three quarters that had 12 weeks and it had absolutely nothing to do with that. I mean, we priced Whole Foods twice a week in many, many markets around the country and we're kind of scratching our head. And we did that before the announcement of the acquisition by the way. Have they come down in prices of some items? Sure. Overall, and some of you have done your own price baskets, while we read about up to 43%, it's a lot closer to 0 than it is 43%. And even with something dramatic, others out there will be impacted a lot more than we are. Other than people wanting to have stuff delivered and we're providing that option based on how we do stuff.","David Bellinger","Got it. And then as my follow up, can you just give us any comments around the recent trajectory of food price deflation and what your expectations are going into 2018?","Richard Galanti","It's pretty flat right now. Within fresh, you're going to see variations like meat has come down a little bit. It was way up for a year, but that's going to be seasonal. Produce depends on props, recent events, oil, gasoline depends on recent events, the hurricanes, but other than that, taking some of those things out, it's pretty flat.","Operator","The last question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel.","Mark Astrachan","I wanted to ask, can you give the percentage of sales that Kirkland Signature represents and then just curious if you think about the margins relative to what else is in store, given increasing competition out there and obviously the favorability of the KS product, would you think about increasing the offering there going forward to help sort of fund offer uniqueness within the store?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Well, percentage wise, ex gasoline, even though, it says Kirkland Signature gasoline is about 24%, 25% of our total sales are non-gas sales, we\u2019ll continue to add items as they make sense. We're not really working towards the number and we think the number will keep going up a little bit, because we do like it, but we've also -- we've tried -- we remind ourselves, our head of merchandising reminds our buyers every day, don't fall in love with it, because it has your name on it and each year, which items, even Kirkland Signature, we just continue because the brand does better, maybe ours is a better value in our minds and maybe it is a better value, but we're still not successful with it. And by the way, part of the focus of our buyers probably before that is to find more brands, we want more brands.","Mark Astrachan","Got it. And then just lastly, you had previously talked about e-commerce expansion being done organically, curious if that's still the case or would you potentially take a look at other things, whether it's national retailer or it\u2019s a logistics provider, something that can help sort of bridge what you're doing externally now with something internally and related to that sort of views on competitive dynamics, meaning you buy something that isn't necessarily something you want, but something that somebody else may want that ultimately could negatively impact your business?","Richard Galanti","I think on the latter part of that, no. That\u2019s going to be the last thing. I always joke, we're not smart enough to figure that one out. I think that we're likely to first of all look for partnerships and ventures to jointly venture something rather than to buy something. As you might expect, we along with other large consumer retailers, get calls every day about everything, whether it's delivery services, food related meal stuff, all kinds of stuff and we're fortunate in the sense that one, we've got some good relationships like this recent expansion, what we're doing with Instacart. That helps.","So I don't see us doing that. That being said, we\u2019ll be open minded to anything. But we'll have to wait and see on that one. We've gotten a lot going on right now with some of the things we're doing that we're excited about and every time, when we tried something, I keep bringing up the steak idea or the steak example or the Copper River salmon answer, then we figure out what else can we do. And there's a lot of those what elses. And so we've got our plate pretty full on those kind of things and we've got to, look, we just rolled this thing out, it\u2019s -- what we rolled out three days ago is a soft opening if you will. There's no publicity out there for it. We have to see how it goes, what it does first.","Mark Astrachan","Thank you.","Thank you, everyone. Have a good day.","Operator","There are no more audio questions at this time.

Welcome to the Q4 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your respective host, Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Sir, you may begin.","Richard Galanti","Thank you and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start by saying that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today's press release, we reported operating results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 2019, the 16 and 52 weeks ended September 1st. Reported net income for the quarter was $1.097 billion or $2.47 a share that compared to $1.043 billion a year ago or $2.36 per share. This year's fourth quarter was negatively impacted by $123 million pretax reserve to SG&A or $96 million after-tax or $0.22 per share related to a product tax assessment.","In terms of this $123 million pretax reserve or charge to SG&A, last week we received an assessment related to certain product taxes. They covered 7.5 year period from January 2009 through July 2016. While we will be filing a protest to this, a reserve for this assessment was recorded in the fourth quarter in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Excluding this reserve, Q4 2019 net income would have been $1.19 billion or $2.69 a share, a 14% increase over last year's fourth quarter.","Net sales for the quarter came in at $46.45 billion, a 7% increase over the $43.41 billion last year, and for the entire fiscal year net sales in fiscal 2019 came in at $149.35 billion, a 7.9% increase over last year's $138.43 billion.","In terms of comp sales as reported in the release, for the 16-week fourth quarter, reported U.S. was 6.2%. Excluding gas deflation, FX, and revenue recognition, it was 5.2%. Canada reported 2.6%; ex-deflation, FX and rev rec, 4.7%. Other International reported 1.9%; ex those items, 5.0%. So, total company both for the 16 weeks with and without those items was a 5.1%. E-commerce was a 19.8% reported comp and a 21.9% ex-FX and rev rec.","In terms of Q4 comp sales metrics, fourth quarter traffic or shopping frequency increased 3.7% worldwide and 3.6% in the U.S. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 60 basis points, gas price deflation was a negative 50 basis points, and rev rec benefited comp sales in the quarter by plus 110. So those three things together essentially zeroed out. Our average transaction or ticket during the fiscal quarter was up 1.4%, both with and without the impacts of gas, FX, and rev rec.","Next on the income statement, our membership fee income reported in the fourth quarter was $1.050 billion, up $53 million or 5.3% over last year's fourth quarter. Ex the impact of FX, the $53 million increase would have been $58 million or up 5.8%.","During the fourth quarter, the 23-month cycle to recognize the incremental P&L benefit of the fee increases that began in June 2017 was completed, and the impact in the Q4 results was almost zero or less than $1 million benefit to the quarter.","In terms of renewal rates, at Q4 end, our U.S. and Canada membership renewal rate came in at 90.9%, up 0.2% from 90.7% as of the end of the last quarter. And worldwide, the renewal rate was 88.4%, up from 88.3% a quarter ago. Both of these figures at all-time highs.","In terms of number of members at Q4 and fiscal year-end, we had 53.9 million member households, that's up from a quarter ago of 53.1 million, and total cardholders at the end of the year, 98.5 million, up from 97.2 million at the end of Q3.","During the quarter, we had 10 net new openings, eight in the U.S., one in the U.K. and our first warehouse opening in China in Shanghai. At fourth quarter end, paid Executive memberships totaled 20.8 million, which was an increase during the quarter of 362,000 or 23,000 a week.","In terms of going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was higher year-over-year by a reported 14 basis points, and ex gas deflation and rev rec, up by 20 basis points.","As usual, I'll ask you to jot down a few items for explanation purposes. In the fourth quarter, you have two columns, both reported and then without gas, deflation, and rev rec. The line items would be -- the first line item would be merchandise, core merchandise. On a reported basis, the year-over-year was down 8 basis points. Ex gas and rev rec, it was down 3 basis points. Ancillary businesses, up 29 basis points and ex those items, up 31 basis points year-over-year. 2% reward, minus 3 basis points and minus 4 basis points; other, minus 4 basis points and minus 4 basis points. If you add those up, you get the plus 14 basis points as reported, and again, ex gas and rev rec, up 20.","Now, in terms of the core merchandise component of the gross margin, it was lower by 8 basis points or might really lower by 3 basis points ex gas and rev rec. Looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to our own sales or what we call core-on-core, margins year-over-year were higher by 4 basis points.","Subcategories within that, the year-over-year and the fourth quarter showed increases in fresh and softlines, partially offset by a little down year-over-year in hardlines with food and sundries being relatively flat year-over-year. Ancillary and other business as mentioned was higher by 29 basis points and 31 basis points higher ex gas and rev rec. Most of that was attributable to strong gasoline margins. Other was minus 4 basis points in both columns.","Moving to SG&A, I'll ask you to jot down the following. Again, two columns, reported and ex deflation -- gas deflation and rev rec. Operations, plus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis points, so minus 2 basis points meaning higher by 2 basis points; central, minus 5 basis points and minus 5 basis points or higher by 5 basis points; stock compensation, plus 2 basis points and plus 2 basis points, so lower by 2 basis points year-over-year; and then other, minus 27 basis points and minus 27 basis points.","And with that, you would get to a reported SG&A percentage year-over-year being higher or worse by 27 basis points coming in at 10.09%; sales, up from 9.82% of sales a year ago. Again, excluding the one-time items discussed earlier, the SG&A would have been flat year-over-year on a reported basis and ex gas and rev rec, higher by 5 basis points.","Now, in terms of the components here, the core operations component excluding the impacts of gas and rev rec again was 2 basis points higher. This figure included the impact of the two wage increases that were taken in June 2018 and March 2019, which essentially hit the year-over-year comparison by an estimated 5 basis points to 6 basis points in the quarter. We estimate that once the first one anniversaries now during the quarter, we estimate that the impact in Q1 and Q2 to that one anniversary will be about a 3 basis point to 4 basis point hit.","Central was higher year-over-year by 5 basis points, both with and without gas and rev rec. IT was the biggest driver of that increase. In terms of stock comp, again, that was helped -- that helped SG&A by 2 basis points. And again, lastly as discussed earlier, the hit -- the $123 million hit to SG&A accounts for the 27 basis points.","Next on the income statement, preopening expense. Preopening expense for the fourth quarter came in at $41 million, $10 million higher than the $31 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This year in the fourth quarter, we opened 12 -- we had 12 total openings, 10 net plus two relos. Our total preopening was up year-over-year primarily due to the preopening costs related to our chicken plant in Nebraska. It's now open for business and we'll have an estimated 45-week ramp up to fill production from the September 10th go-live date.","All told, reported operating income in Q4 increased 1%, coming in at $1.463 billion this year compared to $1.446 billion last year. And again, excluding the one-time items discussed earlier, operating income was up 9.7%.","Below the operating income line, interest expense was $3 million lower or better year-over-year coming in at $45 million, down from $48 million a year earlier and interest income and other for the quarter was higher or better by $23 million year-over-year. Actual interest income was better by $15 million with a combination of both higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates with the balance of $8 million positive variance, primarily favorable FX-related items year-over-year.","So, overall, pretax income again reported, including the one-time item, was up 3%, coming in at $1.492 billion this year and from $1.449 billion last year and again excluding the one-time SG&A charge discussed earlier, operating income would've been up about 11.5%. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the fourth quarter came in at 25.7% compared to 27.4% in the fourth quarter a year ago. This quarter tax rate benefited from a few favorable discrete tax adjustments.","A few other items of note. Again, in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned, we opened 12 total locations net of relos at 10 net new locations. For the whole year, we opened 25 total locations, including five relocations, so a net increase 20. About three quarters of those were in the U.S. and a quarter of them international. At Q4 end, our square footage stood at 114 million square feet.","Regarding CapEx, our fiscal 2019 total spend was right at $3.0 billion. And we estimate the CapEx for the upcoming year will be that or slightly above that but not that different from the past fiscal year.","In terms of stock buybacks in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 52 million shares, 194,000 shares at an average price per share of $268.08. That brought the total year to 247 million shares -- $247 million on 1.097 million shares at an average price of $225.16.","Moving on to a couple other items of note. E-commerce, again as I mentioned for the quarter, the ex-gas and rev rec was up 21.9%. We saw particularly strong growth during the quarter, what we call majors, electronics and appliances, and the like. Total online grocery continues to grow at a very healthy clip, recognizing it's still pretty small and that both includes the two day as well as the one-day fresh relative to Instacart.","E-com for the first time this past quarter carried some new items like KitchenAid appliances, weber grills and several high-quality beauty brands for the first time. In addition, we rolled out a few examples of what we -- if you shop to the warehouse, what we call merchandise roadshows, kind of a treasure hunt for the warehouses. Some of those things are now being put online.","We sold another large diamond ring during the quarter for $220,000. And we have upcoming e-com sites planned for two new countries, Japan and Australia -- excuse me, Japan and Australia later this fiscal year, sometime mid-fiscal year.","In terms of the Costco app, we started to add a few things to with, including the new -- if you use as your digital membership card. That was added in July. We now have over 2.5 million activations during the quarter. Currently, the app allows in addition to digital membership to register as well.","You view current gas prices; Executive members can view their growth of the annual 2% Executive Member Reward. We have a few things related to the pharmacy in terms of refilling and managing pharmacy prescriptions as well as be able to renew and upgrade and the beginnings of some new shopping lists, so it's for promotional offerings. And I will tell you, additional enhancements are in the works and we'll continue to roll those out and more guidance with Costco both in the warehouse and online.","I mentioned earlier that during the quarter, we opened our first unit in China in the City of Minhang, part of Shanghai. That was on August 27th, it\u2019s a great interest. Due to the overwhelming crowds, it was actually closed about four hours into the opening day. Subsequent backgrounds have been well managed and sales have remained very strong over the past month.","We've had record sign-ups there. I think it's been helped by first one that we've opened there as well as the social media presence. We have over -- we currently have over 20,000 members signed up. Just to put that in perspective, worldwide, the average Costco, ones that have been open for months and months that have been open for 35 years, all 12 have approximately 68,000 member households per location. Our next opening is planned for early 2021 and also in Shanghai in the area of Pudong.","In terms of tariffs, next item, a quick update. It continues to be a lot of moving parts and changes and a few increases along the way. A few comments. As you're probably aware, the first three lists, which total about $250 billion of imports from China, includes things from water pictures and air fryers to bicycles to steel shelving to furniture and luggage shredders to things like that. That's current -- those are currently being tariffed at 25%.","With the current plan, we understand approximately go to 30% effective October 15th, but we'll just have to wait and see. List 4a, which is about $110 billion, includes things like kitchenware, equipmentware and domestics, includes TVs, although I don't think we source from there from that. That started at 15% tariff on September 1st and we'll see where that goes.","And then List 4b, which is an additional $155 billion worth of goods including electronics, laptops, tablets, toys, small appliances, and some of the apparel and footwear as well. That's currently planned to go to 15% tariff effective December 15th. Again, we'll wait and see.","Since the beginning of these tariffs over a year ago, we continue to be active in managing and we're possibly mitigating the impact where we can. We accelerate shipments before tariffs is being put into effect or is being planned for an increase to tariffs percentage levels. We are working with suppliers daily. We've gone to pretty much every supplier on every item to see what we can do to both reduce cost and figure out how to do that.","In some cases, we've reduced our commitments on certain items. And again, just on the impact of what we expect, we look at alternative country sourcing where possible and feasible and although again, there's a limited amount of that ability to do that. And we've taken advantage of lower pricing on certain -- on a few U.S. items that have not been impacted the other way. The exchange rate by the way between our two countries has helped a little bit. So, all those things.","As you might expect, it's all over the Board, every item and every vendor is little different. In some cases, we're able to hold off on some and some, we're able to -- we need to push it forward and push that on and we will continue to pursue that. Overall, we think we're in a good position relative to retail overall and given our size and scale and our ability and relationships with our vendors.","The last thing on tariffs, just another area of potential tariffs. It relates to yesterday's WTO announcement that the U.S. can legally impose tariffs of up to $7.5 billion in EU-produced goods annually.","Later yesterday, the U.S. TR released a list of products it plans to target, with duties planning to take effect October 18th. Some of the products included on the list include 25% duties on certain whiskeys and apparel items for the U.K., various cheeses and olive oils from certain European countries and certain pork products, butter and yogurt from various European countries to name a few.","So, that's pretty much it in terms of what we have to say. Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases, we will really -- we will announce our September sales results for the five weeks ending this coming Sunday, October 6th, on Wednesday, October 9th after the market close -- closes.","With that, I'll open it up to questions and answers and turn it back to the operator. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]","We have your first question coming from the line of Michael Lasser from UBS. Your line is now live.","Michael Lasser","Good afternoon and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, you\u2019ve recently run a few promotions to drive membership growth. You've done this in the past periodically. Should we interpret this as any different than that particularly given that you now anniversary all of the benefits from the price increase, I guess, you can say, well, you want to increase membership growth and so that's what's driving that decision. How should we think about that?","Richard Galanti","No, I think that as it relates to the one, I think we've got currently underway, it's very similar to the three or four we've done over the last three years or four years I think. And no real -- we try to put some time between them. We don't want to get people waiting for a promotional item, but they do work and they help and any of the timing is just that, nothing beyond that. I don't anticipate doing another one for a while as we have in the past.","Michael Lasser","Okay, that's very helpful. And then on your growth in China, did it surpass your expectations? And does that influence how many and how quickly you can expand in that country?","Richard Galanti","Well, clearly, it surpassed all of our very high expectations. That being said, we're pretty methodical when we go into a new country, wherever it is, and we opened one or two units to start with over the first year or two and go from there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that building the people structure within a country, while we have help from neighboring countries and other areas to start the process, you really want to build your supervisor, your functional managers in the country.","So, if you'd asked us before, we even opened the first one and felt positive it will be good, but who knows how and when we do -- how well we will do. [indiscernible] We've had five years hence. The answer will probably be the same as it is today. We'll open a couple in the first year or two and then open a couple more perhaps and see where we go from there, and we're certainly pleased and excited about what we've seen, but maybe it gets a little bigger, but certainly nothing that they -- we're going to be pretty methodical about it as we have in other countries.","Michael Lasser","Thank you very much and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Simeon Gutman","Hi Richard. So, on gross margin, it looked pretty solid. I want to make sure I heard properly, the core-on-core was up 4, which I'd say looks pretty normal for you, up a little, down a little, which means that the reported, it sounds like ancillary; the gas was a big piece of that. Can I ask you if the dynamics there, I think, over the past couple of years have improved in general? Are they still getting better or this was just pure market dynamics on the gas side?","Richard Galanti","I think the last few years, not only for us but other big gas retailers, the supermarkets and the Walmart's, generally, the new normal over the last couple of years has been better. And particularly for us, I think as prices historically have come down and some retailers bring them down a little and some a little more, they still give us the ability to, in our view, to have improved margins and operations and probably showing a greater savings relative to what we had a few years ago.","That being said, the quarter was good. There are a couple of quarters, a few quarters back year-over-year that was also good. It does fluctuate, but I'd say the new normal overall is on average better than it had been.","Simeon Gutman","And the core-on-core was pretty normal for you as well?","Richard Galanti","The core-on-core, well, yes, I don't think there was any big surprises there. We always tell you that when it's up a little year-over-year, maybe it'll come down a little. When it's down a little, maybe it will be up a little bit.","As it relates to the underlying factors of competition, we feel that we haven't seen any giant changes in the competitive landscape out there. There's still a lot of competition and there's a lot of headlines out there, but at the end of the day, we're still pretty darn competitive ourselves.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And my follow-up is on the EBIT dollar growth. It looked like it came in high single-digit like 9%-ish this year. And if you take the average over the last several years, it's coming around high single-digit that range. As you look out to your next fiscal year, is there anything one way or the other that should impact that? I think the consensus is modeling a lower rate. I know you don't comment on that, but it's been several years with a little bit outsized growth, and so just curious if there's any big spending items, margin issues that we should think about as we model the next year.","Richard Galanti","There's lots of everything, Simeon. We really don't talk about the future. I mean we certainly feel good about what we're doing merchandising-wise where all retailers are impacted by tariffs right now. That's having a little bit of an impact.","But beyond that, we feel good about what we got going on in terms of opening up another 20-ish units next year and driving membership. We're certainly pleased with the seeing our renewal rates continue to go in the higher direction and getting new members. So, overall, we feel good, but we'll see.","Simeon Gutman","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim. Your line is now live.","John Heinbockel","Hew Richard, two questions on gas. One, I don't think you -- or maybe wrong, you guys think about an interaction between gas margin and core-on-core, right? Meaning if you're getting more margin at the pump in any given quarter, you can't put that back a little bit into core-on-core. Do you think about it that way? And then on gas, gallon growth, where is that now versus where it's been over the last year or two?","Richard Galanti","Well, look. We don't -- in terms of the margin if we're doing stronger and wanting to do, can we be a little more competitive elsewhere? Well, not completely. Human nature dictates that sure, when things are going well in one area, you see what else you can do in another area. But I would say there, we don't manage it that way necessarily.","As it relates to gallons, I think our gallons are up in the high singles. You have a theory, yes. So, we continue to do in terms of gallon comps much stronger than whole U.S. industry of gallon of gasoline.","John Heinbockel","And then secondly, what's your -- where do you stand now with the opening schedule for the year? Maybe by geography and cadence. Is it -- I guess, this past year was a little bit back-end loaded and I guess, it's the same in 2020?","Richard Galanti","Yes, probably so. We generally try to get things open before the holidays, so when things are -- if you missed the holiday, whether it's February or April or May, who cares as much, but if you try to push it forward little bit as you approach back-to-school, Labor Day all the way through Christmas and New Year's. And so I think the last -- the year before was the same way. We opened a disproportionate number of locations in Q4. So, generally speaking, yes, I don't have a schedule in front of me exactly, but--","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Christopher Horvers","Thanks. Good evening. So, wanted to ask you a question about average ticket growth ex FX and gas. If you take a look in August, that showed slow down pretty sharply relative to the prior trend. So, want to pick that at that. Is that a comparison? Is that a change in mix or perhaps lapping against some of the center aisle of grocery, price increases that the vendors are starting to put through last year? Is it investment in price then? And so just want to get your thoughts on what's driving that and any thoughts on the outlook there?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think the prior -- if I'm not -- if I'm correct, I think the last in Q3, it was like one-eight or one-nine and this quarter, it was a one-four. I don't have a good answer, a specific answer for you on that. It could be mix. It probably is mix, but I don't know off the top of my head.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then on the tariffs, as you think about what's been passed through, how are your peers acting? Are you seeing more -- are your peers taking portfolio approach in terms of you're trying to keep price items at certain price points and then balancing out versus, say, less elastic items and how are you assessing the landscape on that side?","Richard Galanti","Yes, I can say to start with that we don't see any major competitive issues. Certainly, it's -- I personally think it's easier to manage some subset of our 3,800 total items that we saw at given times on location versus retailers selling at 50,000 and 100,000 and 150,000 items and they're dealing with categories.","Certainly, on bigger ticket items, it's harder. I mean it's hard. With smaller-ticket items, it might be easier to eat a little bit of it. One with something like furniture or Lawn & Garden and things like that, that's a little harder. But overall, we have -- we generally feel pretty good about it.","And we're, by the way, the other thing is we're an item-driven business. I'm sure -- I don't have examples in front of me, but I'm sure there have been examples of items where if we weren't able to greatly mitigate or mitigate as best we can be some of that tariff, in some cases again, we will try to geographically move the item or source from another supplier. There are limits to what you can do on that. But overall, I think were able to decide not to sell something and put something else in its place. I think that makes a little easier for us relative to general merchandisers. But again, it's -- it impacts us all.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then on the announcement last night, I mean, there is some items on there that standout, olive oil and cheese. Can you talk about particularly in the olive oil side; I imagine this might be the largest seller of olive oil in the United States. So, can you talk about where you're sourcing that? I think Spain's covered, but Italy is not?","Richard Galanti","Yes, we source from several countries, including the ones that you just mentioned. There'll be some impact.","Christopher Horvers","Got it. And then I guess the last question is that the money question here is another quarter down and we haven't had any announcement as to what you're going to do with all the cash in the balance sheet that continues to build. So, can you talk about what is your thought process is there? Has anything changed? Are you trying to keep dry powder for any particular reason? Thanks very much.","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, I don't think there's any dry powder -- M&A-related dry powder. We haven't or currently plan to do anything. We do have a total of $1.7 billion coming due in December and February, $1.2 billion and then $500 million I believe. And so we'll write -- we'll pay that down.","We're always asked about questions about the special dividend, and our comments have been is that we've done three of them. They seem to have worked well or viewed positively. So, it's still in the -- it's still in our back pocket. But they are special, and so we'll have to wait and see what we decide to do in the future. But there's nothing specific that we have planned.","Christopher Horvers","Understood. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Karen Short","Hey, thanks very much. Just on operating profit growth. I mean it was -- so the 10%-ish growth, it was up $140 million excluding the product tax assessment. But can you just give a little color on how much stronger year-over-year gas margins might have impacted that growth rate? Because I was kind of backing into about $150 million in incremental dollars from better gas margins--","Richard Galanti","Well, we don't disclose specifics. But as I think I mentioned, I think it was Q2 year-over-year that we also had a good gas margin, certainly, that was a help to that.","Karen Short","Okay. But is that estimate like somewhere in the range or is it way too high?","Richard Galanti","We really don't disclose -- Karen, we really don't go into that specific of a detail.","Karen Short","Okay. And then wondering if you could maybe give a little color in terms of elasticity and anything you can point to on elasticity response with categories where you did raise prices.","Richard Galanti","Sure. I mean generally speaking, the bigger the ticket items where you also have a good portion of the tariffs impacts the price, raises the price. I mean there was -- these are anecdotal examples, but there was one category of those types of items that typically is up mid-single-digits year-over-year and instead was flat to down a couple of percent. And that is -- that included some pricing increases, so probably; I was down 10% in units. But that's a subset of a subset of a category, and so I don't want to suggest it was everything.","But I mean given examples from our buyers where there have been items where we've essentially -- most of the tariffs is reflected in our price increase and we saw just as many users as we thought we were going to previous to that. There's been others where we've -- the price increase tariff-related, less than half of the tariff related to the price increase and even that, we saw some unit reductions results. So, it really has been over the board.","But generally speaking, the bigger the item, when you pick an item that retails for $999 and have to get it up, we get it even about $1,240 -- by using a 25% example or beat 25% of the cost. But unless -- first that you try to do is get it to $1,199 and then go from there or $1,099. But it's really over the board. That net-net that was a slight negative impact.","Karen Short","Okay. And then, I guess along those lines, can you just maybe give a little color on what inflation was at, I guess, both cost and at retail? And then if you can parse that out between consumables and non-consumables?","Richard Galanti","It was very little. We've seen very little. You still see taking tariffs away for a second on electronics and things you'll see some deflation. Overall in consumables, it's been pretty much steady as she goes. One question I was asked earlier this week was about what's going on with the freight components, and freight has actually improved a little bit you over year. It's higher than it was a few years ago, but overall; it's all in the soup here.","Karen Short","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett. Your line is now live.","Chuck Grom","Hey thanks. Good afternoon Richard. Just on the core-on-core between categories, a couple were up, hardlines was down. Food and sundries, I think, you said was relatively consistent year-over-year. Just can you dive into the hardline compression and also the change from last quarter on the food and sundries segment? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Yes. A part of its mix change. I mentioned earlier online but also in store, electronics and majors, those tend to be a little -- electronics tends to be a little lower-margin business, but good growth still.","And that again, when I ex the $64,000 question of is it competition, we're not seeing a lot of big changes out there, whether there's a lot of headlines of what's going on particularly on the food side, but we haven't seen any big changes.","Chuck Grom","Okay, fair enough. And then can you just remind us how you guys are thinking about the company's long-term club growth potential, particularly here in the U.S. and if you're seeing any signs of saturation in any of your key markets, both domestically and internationally?","Richard Galanti","Well, by definition, like in the U.S. and Canada and the rate of growth will slow down. But I would have said that three years ago because of what we've done in the U.S. and Canada. So, we keep finding more opportunities. But over time, it will slow down. We're also, of course, adding the business centers. We have, I think, 18 in the U.S. and one in Canada with our second coming shortly in Canada and so that'll add a little bit to it.","When asked recently, what is your guesstimate, we truly guesstimate over the next 10 years on the basis of like five 40-ish in the U.S., maybe other 12-plus a year. Right now, it's been 15 a year, so it will come down a little bit.","In Canada, one-plus a year. We thought we were a saturated at 80 in Canada and now we have 101 or 102. So, that will keep increasing. Certainly, there will be more -- what I think I think we feel most comfortable thing is that five or three years from now, the penetration of the percentage of those openings will certainly abide then likely by then if nothing is certain the outside of the U.S. and Canada.","Chuck Grom","Okay, great. And then just last question, online sales, I think, are about 5% of the total revenue. When you guys are analyzing shoppers that are using either CostcoGrocery, Instacart, I'm curious if the purchases have replaced the in-store trip. And I guess if you've analyzed how that could potentially impact your in-store traffic over the next two to five years? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Look, it's still early. It's the first full year, I guess. Generally speaking, you see more shops overall recognizing it's a little less when you're shopping online. And then that is still to a slight net positive than what we've seen before. But we have to be on the lookout is does it replace the shop? How many shops does it replace? But what we're seeing is you've got more -- somebody who's inflowing if you will and reducing their trips to the location a little bit. So, I call it neutral to slightly good right now, but that doesn't -- who knows what happens tomorrow? So far, I mean, we feel good about that, by the way. But we can't predict.","I think by the way, I think part of it also is when we talked about -- what we talked about in the past is we use -- to communicate to our members aside from the traditional Costco connection and a lot of the e-mails, and the e-mails are not just for shopping online, e-mails are talking about hot things that are happening in the warehouse while supplies last in some cases. And we've seen good examples of that that can help drive frequency to the warehouse or create a trip.","And that along with gasoline, not every person fills up with gas comes in. So, I think about half do, a little over half do. Even if one of them is incremental, that's a positive. We don't check to see what that is. We're not asking you to. But we know it's got to -- it can't hurt. It's got to help. So, we think that we're -- I think those are the types of things that will help drive us continue to drive traffic into the buildings, which we want to do.","Chuck Grom","Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good afternoon guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Just a quick follow-up on Chuck's kind of store opening question. Do you have a plan for U.S. versus international store openings for the current fiscal year?","Richard Galanti","Yes, I think U.S. is still going to be a little more than half. I don't have the sheet in front of me.","Scot Ciccarelli","A little more half. Okay, that's good enough. Richard, when you guys bring popular branded products where there's a lot of price transparency, you mentioned Weber grills on the call in your website, how are you guys trying to target for pricing on those kinds of products when they can be found in lots of different spots? Can you guys price competitive, of course, but can you provide any color on kind of how you're thinking about kind of price caps when you've got obviously the Home Improvement guys out there, Amazon, Amazon Marketplace, et cetera?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Look, we want to be the lowest priced and we're going to go as low as we can feel good about it. I found in some instances, we bundle so we create a value that includes perhaps accessories and other items or an extra whatever and -- but these are real value, I mean, real items that have a value to it. And that's to show on even greater settings. And we've done that in all kinds of things, whether it's computers or big appliances.","And by the way, I think a lot of times; competitive pricing tends to be on some of the entry level and what you see advertised, if you will. And then consumers generally trade themselves up to the -- with all the extra accessories and what have you and that's where we continue to show good savings to. I mean we look at some of those big-ticket items and we -- they're pretty very strong savings to traditional.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Bobby Griffin from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Bobby Griffin","Yes, good afternoon Richard and everybody else. Thank you for taking my questions. First, I just want to go back to the grocery delivery and some of the initiatives that have been rolled out here in the U.S. Have those been rolled into some of your other international markets that you're operating e-commerce sites in?","Richard Galanti","Yes, Canada now, we rolled it out in Canada with some help from others. We would like to do it in a few other countries, but we haven't said when and where. But in short order.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. So some time -- is it safe to assume some time in FY 2020?","Richard Galanti","FY 2020, yes. Starting with the two-day, which is easier, two-day dry. But in Canada, we're doing one-day fresh as well. We'll be doing one-day fresh, but we're not doing it yet. We're doing two-day dry up there already.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. I appreciate that. And I guess lastly from me, I just want to touch on working capital continues to be impressive with payables, as you know, ellipsing over 102% of inventory now. How much more room do you think you have in that as we model out for one? And is there any one-time items there that are driving some of the performance that we're going to keep in mind?","Richard Galanti","Well, with the seasonal issues, our Q1 is a month or right around Thanksgiving time. And that's generally when it's the highest payables as a percent of inventories. So, I think generally, the low point is Q2 with February where the sales are a little softer on a seasonal basis.","Other than that, if anything, as we build out e-com and have more inventory in there and want to make sure we're trying to grow it, that actually probably impacted a little negatively that was turning to the fact that it's currently a very strong number.","We also have some programs where ideally, sometimes, you have been -- there's usually smaller vendors that even though we have negotiated extended terms in some cases, particularly in seasonal items or stuff that's coming a few months and, sometimes, if they need working capital, it's a good rate of return for us to pay early, if you will, what's called anticipation. These are not big numbers, but those impacted a little bit that will reduce itself. Overall, I'd probably look at what those percentages were at each of the quarter end for the last few years and assume it's not that different. That's the best guess.","Bobby Griffin","Okay. I appreciate the detail. Best of luck this fiscal year.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question comes from the line of Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Your line is now live.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good evening. This is Jeff online for Chris. Just a quick question. You touched on this a little bit with the topic of tariffs. Just wanted to know your general temperature check on the consumer. It sounds like they are responding in some ways at big-ticket items like you said with price increases. But in general, what you're feeling on how consumers are acting just given both tariff politics and geopolitical concerns and stuff of that nature?","Richard Galanti","I think all I remember is we speak in a sense that we're still seeing good growth, certainly, very good renewal rates, good results and openings. So, we feel pretty good about it. Now, if you ask me how does that relate to consumer, who the heck knows? I think we all turned off the television and stopped listening to everything every day. We'll all be better.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Richard Galanti","I think we're also -- everybody is a little desensitized to everything.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. I understand. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live.","Oliver Chen","Hi thanks. Congrats on the progress in diamonds as well. Regarding the digital execution, the mobile app development has been really progressive. What are your thoughts on the biggest needle movers there? And as you think across digital, whether that be adding new product or improving check out and search or your new D.C., how would you prioritize the bigger drivers for traffic and growth that large?","Richard Galanti","I think, first of all, as it relates to the app, just getting more people on it. I mentioned there's about 2.5 million since we improved it, there's a lot of work to be done to add things to it. But that was like since July. I think we have over 10 million members on the app.","One of the other things was just getting e-mail addresses from everybody. You guys have done this for a long time, we were a little later to the game then others in terms of collecting e-mail addresses years ago. And we had a big push in the last couple of years and we dramatically increased the number of members where we have good e-mail addresses. Now that sounds simple and why did we do that, I can only tell you we are and it's -- and that's helping. We're getting more people, we're getting more people to open the e-mail and click on things.","And so I think we need to talk about in the past. We still have these different buckets of money starting with the improved -- the improvement from the credit card transition a couple of years ago to membership fee increase, tax reform, all these things have helped and, as you know, we take that into make it a better value for the member. And I think that's helped us whether it's buyers, Hot Buys, a while items. And I think that's giving us a little bit of a leg up over the last couple of years in terms of helping achieve the numbers that we have.","So, I think more connections the members are going to help. Certainly, there's no slowdown in renewal rates. That's been good to us. Beyond that, it's what we see every four weeks in our budget meetings from the Myers, doing exciting stuff, constantly improving existing items. There are a number of examples, whether at KS side is we continue to improve the item and lower the price point well and improved item, and therefore, decrease the value dramatically. They're looking at exciting items, not just for us in the U.S. to ship to these other countries, but also to take some exciting items from other countries and bringing them to other parts of Costco.","So, I think on when I think about from a merchandising standpoint, we're at the top of our game a lot of things. On the efficiencies side, we have a lot of expenses going on. We talked about e-commerce for a moment. There's cost associated with that as we do that. There's IT in general, with everything that we've got going on, whether it's e-commerce or fulfillment and depot infrastructure, the new poultry complex. So, there's lots of things that are in our numbers in terms of expenses as well and we've done pretty well. So, a little -- I think we keep doing the kinds of things that we're doing as it relates to global sourcing and in some cases, some vertical integration and -- but ultimately, driving more value.","Oliver Chen","Thanks Richard. And you've done a good job managing the digital margins overall. Do you pursue the right kind of fulfillment options and supply chain and getting the smaller packages customers with speed? What are your thoughts on those investments and how they align with what customers are looking for with speed of delivery?","Richard Galanti","Well, we're not going to be -- you're not going to be able to order something and drop it off an hour later anytime soon. For us, first order of improvement was actually I remember it wasn't that long ago were online, particularly on the big-ticket items, but physical items as well, as we expected delivery times of three to five weeks and now it's three to five days. And certain items with certain vendors are now on -- you can actually schedule delivery and installation.","So, we're -- tires is a great example as well. It used to be -- with those online now, you can actually order them and have them and schedule your appointment at the warehouse where you're shopping at. These are all basic things but things that we haven't done for a long time. So, I think you'll see continued improvement in that. And none of it's easy, and it all costs more than you think. But those are our numbers.","Oliver Chen","And finally that you've really had good momentum, including with diamonds at Costco and the big-ticket sales of diamonds. What's your strategy with that business? And how has it been going? Any things we should think about?","Richard Galanti","Look, I mean it starts with great quality and great value. Those are the -- one of the things I think that has helped us on -- that's -- the jewelry area is a good example with the lockers that we're now rolling out to a number of locations. A lot of people on high-value small-sized items, they can't ship it to their place of work and they don't want to leave it at their front porch. And so we saw an uptick of some of those items and some other items like handbags and a little bit number of electronics.","But as it relates to jewelry overall, I know we've got a lot of press because I mentioned a $400,000 diamond a couple of quarters ago. We're selling close to 200,000 karats of diamonds a year. That's a lot of karats. And -- so jewelry business is -- it's one of the things that hits you just past the electronics when you typically walk into a Costco and it's all about value and trust.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. Best regards.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question coming -- comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is now live.","Robert Ohmes","Hey Richard. Thanks for taking my questions. One question I'm getting is just a lot on the chicken plant. Can you just sort of let us know how that is going so far versus expectations? And also was it about $10 million of the preopening expense this quarter? And how does it affect preopening going forward? And maybe related to chicken plants, are there any other types of vertical integration, things that you might be looking out to do further?","Richard Galanti","Well, look, this is a big plant. I think it's the most state-of-the-art plant that I understand in the country. It's going to be very efficient, but it's going to take close to a year to get to full production. And the first several weeks have gone as planned in terms of the first chicken went through and more each day and -- but you're going to get to 2 million -- processing of 2 million birds a year -- I'm sorry, 2 million birds a week in about 40 more weeks.","The preopening stopped effectively when we opened it on September 10th. So, there's a little bit in Q1 but not like that big amount. But it's a huge facility, and it's also air-chilled. About 95% of U.S. poultry plants are still water chilled. So, all the issues in terms of -- it's considered a very high-quality food item and it allows us to deliver that while doing a lot of things for the environment as well. So, there's a lot of good things. It didn't come without a cost. It was a big investment for us and a little bit more in a year, but we're excited about it.","Other things, we had -- a year ago, we had a second meat plant. We've had one in Tracy, California for many years. We opened one in Morris, Illinois. We also, as you know, opened a bakery commissary in Canada that will also serve much of the United States in terms of things like cookie dough and croissants ready to bake off on premise.","We're looking at a variety of greenhouse opportunities. There's a lot of technology and new things going on in the area of agriculture. Would be nice to greatly lower the price of not having to airship things to Hawaii as well as being closer to the market and being better for the environment. So, I think given our size and given some of the things that are going on, we're going to hopefully benefit from that. But that's -- other than that, there's nothing else, I don't think, we've got planned in a big way. But I would say beyond the couple of things I mentioned in the last year and a half and certainly this new chicken plant, a few things on the greenhouse side, but not the type of capital investment required that was done in the poultry complex.","Robert Ohmes","Got it. That's great. Thanks Richard.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Michael Montani from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Michael Montani","Hi Richard. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask for an update on Executive program rollout, if you can just remind us kind of which countries have it now and which ones might be slated to get it next?","Richard Galanti","Well, we have it in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, U.K., Korea, and Japan. And we've just started -- we just rolled it out this month in Japan. Korea, we rolled out about a year, year and a half ago. A year ago. ","Michael Montani","Okay, great. One housekeeping one if I could is around gasoline. Can you give us a sense? I've been thinking that was around 10%, 11% of sales for the quarter. And also what was the ASP for gasoline this quarter?","Richard Galanti","Hold on. I think it's on the [Indiscernible]. $2.94 versus $3.05 a year ago.","Michael Montani","Okay. And the last thing that I had was on Citi Visa, can you give us an update just on how many members have that now and what you're seeing in terms of third-party spend, just how it's progressing?","Richard Galanti","I don't have those numbers in front of us. I can tell you we continue to add new members. We continue to -- the average reward per existing credit card holder on the Citi Visa card continues to increase. The rewards are substantial, and it's really working well. It's probably better than we had originally had hoped and it's done well for us and hopefully our partners.","Michael Montani","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now live.","Kelly Bania","Hi good evening. Thanks for fitting me in Richard. Just wanted to go back to the store potential question really in the U.S. I think it was a few years ago that you know that you were able to kind of go into some smaller communities than you maybe originally thought. And so just curious, as you think about the next couple of years, what kind of size and demographics of the communities are you looking at and planning for new clubs.","And also, when you go back to the saturation question and think about how do you analyze when you think you are at saturation, what are some of the key metrics that you look at? Is it the pace of the ramp in terms of sales, the cannibalization of members? Or just any help on how you guys think about analyzing that?","Richard Galanti","30 years ago, I think the view was you needed about 0.5 million people to trade area plus certain number of businesses and all that kind of stuff. Today, that number could be as low as 200,000 sometimes. It depends.","Some of the smaller or medium markets we've gone into in the last few years generally are markets where our competition -- our direct competitors were, in many cases, for 20 or 30 years and we had just never gone there. We've gotten probably a little more confident that when we go in it, there's room for both of us, and we've done relatively well.","I think the other thing is, if you look back over the last few years and my guess is in the upcoming years, there'll be some infill opportunities. I've used the example on calls on the East side of Seattle, in the Bellevue side of Seattle where, historically, we had three locations, Issaquah, Kirkland and Woodinville. About two years ago, we opened in Redmond. And we only added -- let's say in those three locations, had about 190,000-ish members between them, households, so 60,000, 65,000 each. We only added about 10,000 new members in the next year, but you had a lot of loyal members that started shopping more frequently because we were closer to them.","Part of that comes with you have high volume. And those -- that example, I think as -- before we opened that fourth location on this side of Seattle, we had I think over $800 million aggregate sales, 1 in the low threes and the other two in the mid to high twos. And when you get to that level, that gives a little more comfort that you can afford a little cannibalization. In that example, I think the first year, net of cannibalization, we did $120-plus million of business, $120 million, $130 million of business. So, it's pretty easy to estimate and guesstimate what you think you can do particularly when you have a loyal membership base.","And then there are other markets like if you look at the Greater Los Angeles market, I'm talking greater geographic market, I think we probably have 60-ish -- roughly 60 units. The view is we can have another 15, but they're all very specific geographies, which are not quite impossible, but very difficult. And we'd be thrilled to get 1 of those 15 open every couple of years, but you don't know if that can happen. So, I think it's all over the board in terms of smaller trade areas, markets where our competition has been and we are just entering and then continue the expansion and infills.","Kelly Bania","Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just another one on click and collect and how that's going and maybe what you're learning from a logistics and labor perspective as you do that for some of the big ticket items. And then any changes or thoughts with respect to broadening that to some other categories like grocery, which I realize are more maybe complicated and labor-intensive?","Richard Galanti","Yes, I don't see us going too deep. I mean we're talking about tires and pharmacy and jewelry, handbags, computers, high-value small-sized items for the time being.","Kelly Bania","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your line is now live.","Laura Champine","Thanks for taking my question. It's just a quick one on inventory. Your inventory receipts looks like were -- grew a little less rapidly than they have in prior quarters and also relative to sales growth. So, just wanted to get a sense of why you might have cut your ordering and whether that has any -- whether that reflects on your thoughts on our current quarter sales trends?","Richard Galanti","My guess is it's a little bit of an anomaly that I don't read a lot into it. It might be that we've really built up, as an example, increased year-over-year online, inventories related to our e-com and things like that. But that's happened -- maybe less of that happened in this quarter. We've kind of cycled that for a year, I'm guessing. Other than that, I don't -- there's nothing baked to read into that.","Laura Champine","Understood. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Why don't we take two more questions?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question coming from the line of Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.","Erica Eiler","Good afternoon. It's actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So, I just had one quick question just flipping back to international. So, when you look at a market like China, when do you typically see an inflection point and profitability in those clubs?","Richard Galanti","Well, at the club level, it could be the first year or a few years down the road. You've got a big central expense you've geared up. Whether you have one location or 10, there's not a big change -- a huge change in the cost of a central -- with the buyers and operations people and accounting department and the like. I mean it'll grow some but not nearly from one to 10.","And so it depends on the country. Usually, it can be year four or five. I think in Japan, which is now 20-ish years old, our original budget was to open five in five years and turned a quarter of profitability towards the end of year five. I think we hit profitability near the end of year four, and we opened six. So -- but that's probably a good guesstimate. It's probably going to be slower in a country like France where it took us 10 years to get one opened. And while we're just looking for additional sites, it still could be a couple of years out. So, you're not going to go from one to five in five years. But that's going to happen. We're going to have a mix of those.","Erica Eiler","Okay, great. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. We have your next question coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now live.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good evening Richard. One housekeeping question. Can you talk about the tax reserve on the product? What drove that? Was it an excise tax kind of thing?","Richard Galanti","It was essentially on tax that some authority thought we should have been collecting and we're, again, going to file a protest and see how much. But I can't really talk to a lot about it yet. But again, it relates to, I'd say, a seven and a half year period that ended in 2016 that we were just notified before the formal assessment. And again, under GAAP accounting, we've reserved for it.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. And then looking at the tariff situation, could that maybe an impetus to put -- use private label sourcing on more products as a result to get the price down? And in general, what are you thinking about for new categories, new items for private label in the coming fiscal year?","Richard Galanti","Yes, not really for tariffs. First of all, some of our private label items are sourced out of China as well, so it's going to impact everybody. And nothing changes quickly overnight. In terms of KS items, I think that you have seen of late and you'll continue to see a variety of items, I mean recent introductions or things like all kinds of specialty waters, essence waters, extra virgin olive oil that they have some impact on tariffs, chocolate chips.","I'm just looking down the list here, several apparel items for men, women and children, more housewares. So, I think you're going to continue to see that grow and even -- and raise the quality further of existing items, that continuous improvement cycle. You're going to see that on some frozen food items, diapers. I'm just looking down my list here, soaps, coffee pods.","We've taken the KS coffee pod, which I think, three or four years ago, we went -- it went to fair trade. Since then, we -- it's now organic and recyclable and we've lowered the price by over 10% to the customer while improving, if you will, the value and the quality. And it's driving more sales. So, we -- again, we -- there's lots of little things as regards to the types of items and what we're doing there.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right. Thank you. Good luck for next year -- this year.","Richard Galanti","Thank you. I think that's it. Well, thank you, everyone and the group here will be around if there's any additional questions. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you, everyone, for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Have a lovely day."],"6022":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q3 2018 Earnings Conference Call May 31, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Simeon Gutman - Morgan Stanley","Michael Lasser - UBS","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Karen Short - Barclays","Peter Benedict - Baird","Kate McShane - Citi ","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Laura Champine - Loop Capital","Kelly Bania - BMO Capital Markets","David Bellinger - Oppenheimer","Operator","Good afternoon.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. You may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Josh, and good afternoon to everyone. I'll start of course by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. And that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today's press release, we reported our operating results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the 12 weeks that ended on May 13th. Net income for the quarter was $750 million or $1.70 per share that compared to $700 million or $1.59 per share last year in the third quarter. Last year in the third quarter, net income was positively impacted by the $82 million or plus $0.19 per share tax benefit and that was in connection with the $7 per share special cash dividend that we had done at that time.","I\u2019ll start by reviewing our third quarter operating results and then allow some time of course for Q&A. In terms of sales, net sales for the quarter came in at $31.62 billion, or 12.1% increase over last year\u2019s third quarter sales of $28.22 billion. Net sales for the first 36-weeks of fiscal 2018 increased 12.0% to 95.02 billion, up from $84.82 billion last year to date \u2013 last year for the first three quarters year-to-date.","In terms of comparable sales, which are reported in the press release, for the 12-week period U.S. was 9.7, excluding the impact of gas inflation it was 7.7. Canada on a reported basis for the 12 weeks comps were 11.3, and ex-gas inflation and FX impact was up 4.8. Other international reported at 11.8, ex-gas inflation and FX 5.8. So, all told, total company at 10.2% comp and ex-gas inflation and FX up 7.0%.","E-commerce, which we, of course separate out here is 36.8% for the 12-weeks, and 35.5% ex-FX. So that continues strong. Similar statistics in the press release for the 36-weeks year-to-date. In terms of third-quarter sales metrics, third-quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 5.1% both worldwide and within the U.S., strengthening foreign currencies relative to U.S. dollar impacted sales by approximately 145 basis points to the positive, and gasoline inflation added an additional 170 basis points.","Cannibalization weighed on the comp to the tune of minus 60 basis points. Our average front-end transaction or front-end ticket was up 4.9%, and again excluding the benefits from both gas inflation and FX that average ticket would have been up somewhere in the mid-high single digits about 1.7%, 1.8%, up. Next on the income statement and membership fee income, reported in the quarter $737 million, up $93 million from $644 million during Q3 of last year or up 14.4%.","The benefit of strong foreign currencies was about 9 million of that $93 million increase or ex that it would have been $84 million. Now, of the $93 million increase year-over-year, a little over half related to the membership fee increases that we have taken in the last year, year-and-a-half. The majority of which came from the $5 and $10 annual fee increases taken last June 1 in the U.S. and Canada. And a small balance of that from the fee increases taken other international operations starting back in September of 2016.","We will continue by the way to see membership fees based on the deferred accounting, the June 1, 2017 increases in U.S. and Canada last year. We continue to see the benefit of that year-over-year increase in the membership fee line. It will peak in Q4, this coming quarter, this 16-week quarter and then still year-over-year increases, but all are \u2013 at least three may be four of them, all of next year in fiscal 2019 as well. In terms of membership fee renewal rates, our U.S. and Canada member renewal rates at Q3 end came in at \u2013 were 90.1%, similar to where they stood a quarter earlier at 90.1. Slight uptick just rounding to the 90.1.","Worldwide rates improved to 87.5%, up from 87.3% 12 weeks ago at Q2 end, with the uptick in renewal rates and other international operations led by Asia, both Taiwan, Japan and Korea. In terms of number of members at Q3 end, in terms of total number of households at the end of Q2 it stood at 50.4 million and 12 weeks later at the end of Q3 is now \u2013 it then stood at 50.9 million. Total cardholders, 92.2 million a quarter ago, 12 weeks ago, and at Q3-end 93.0 million.","During the fiscal quarter, we had two new openings. Also, at Q3-end, as of Q3-end our paid executive member base stood at 19.0 million households. That\u2019s an increase of 199,000 households from 12 weeks earlier or about 17,000 new Gold Star members per week. Related to the benefit from last year's fee increases that year-over-year quarterly fee increase volumes I mentioned continue to benefit both Q4 and into several quarters next year, but on a diminished amount year-over-year quarter.","Going down to the gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the third quarter was lower year-over-year by 46 basis points, coming in at 11.05% during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to 11.51%. Now that minus 46 basis point figure year-over-year on a reported basis, excluding gas inflation it was minus \u2013 it would have been minus 28 and let me again ask you as I usually do to jot down just a couple of columns for Q3 2018. The first one would be, as reported, and the second one would be excluding the impact of gas inflation. The five-line items, the first one would be merchandise core.","In Q3 2018, on a reported basis that was down year-over-year by 33 basis points and ex-gas inflation down by 17 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported minus 10 basis points year-over-year, minus 6 ex-gas inflation, 2% reward plus 2 as reported and flat without gas inflation. Other minus 5 and minus 5, and I\u2019ll talk about that in a second. So, total if you add up those two columns, on a reported basis again, gross margin was lower by 46 basis points, ex-gas inflation lower by 28 basis points.","As I mentioned, looking at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, so quarter-on-quarter if you will, margins year-over-year and in Q3 were lower actually by minus 4 basis points. Subcategories within core gross margin year-over-year in Q3. Food and sundries was up slightly and hardlines, soft lines, and fresh foods. The other three components of core were down just slightly. The slightly year-over-year core on core gross margins in third quarter resulted from our continuing investment in price to drive sales and widen the value gap between us and our competition.","Ancillary and other businesses gross margin, I think were reported down 10 \u2013 down 6 ex-gas. Some of that has increased gas sales penetration, which is a much lower margin business rather other parts of it is - some of the other ancillary businesses were down a little bit as well. 2% reward was flat ex-gas as I mentioned, and other, which was a minus 5 year-over-year comparison, 5 basis points.","Last year, we were incurring some incremental costs where we have been, as I mentioned last two quarters we\u2019ve been incurring some incremental costs primarily related to the rollout of our new centralized returns facilities. This will continue to impact us for one more quarter in Q4. In each of the prior two quarters I had mentioned on a sequential basis on a year-over-year. In Q1, we estimate it was about 7 basis point negative impact, in Q2 minus 6, and in Q3 minus 5, and again there will be some small detriment I assume in Q4 and then we will have anniversaried that.","Moving to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in Q3 year-over-year was lower or better by 32 basis points on a reported basis and ex-gas inflation better or lower by 16 basis points, coming in at 9.98% of sales this year reported compared to 10.30 last year. Like with gross margin, I will ask you to take the two columns. First one is of reported Q3 2018, and the second column would be, excluding the impact of gas inflation for Q3 2018. First one, operations, better or plus 26 basis points on a reported basis and plus 13 basis points or lower in ex-gas.","Central, minus 1 and minus 3. Stock compensation plus 2 and plus 1. Other plus 5 and plus 5. So, if you add those two columns up. The first column would add up to the reported 32 basis point improvement in SG&A and again ex-gas inflation it would be plus 16 basis points. Basically, it\u2019s all about sales. Core operations, lower better strong topline sales lead to improvement in payroll benefits and other variable fixed costs generally speaking. Central expense was higher year-over-year as you can see in the chart we just made by one basis point on a reported basis and three without gas, primarily related to our continuing IT efforts. ","Stock compensation again lower by little against strong sales help that. Other, better by five. That really is nothing this year. Last year, we pointed out that there were two non-recurring legal items in Q3 last year totaling $14 million or 5 basis points. And we didn\u2019t have any detriment related to that this year.","Next on the income statement is preopening. Preopening this year came in at $8 million lower by $7 million from last year's $15 million. This year in Q3, as I mentioned, we had two openings; one in Mexico, and one in Korea. Last year, we had three openings. One each in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Last year in the number we also had some additional spend in Q3 relating to the fourth quarter openings last year in France and Iceland.","Upcoming in Q4 this year we have 15 total openings, 13 net new units, plus 2 relocations. That compares to 12 gross and net locations last year in the quarter. All told, reporting operating income in Q3 came in at $1.67 billion or up $99 million or 10% higher than year-over-year than last year's 968. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense came in at $16 million higher year-over-year at $37 million this year that compares to $21 million a year ago. That\u2019s mostly a result of last May's $3.8 billion debt offering debt offering that we did in conjunction with our special dividend.","Interest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $23 million in the quarter. Actual interest income and mostly interest income for the quarter was better or higher by $6 million. We also benefited year-over-year comparison by various FX items to the tune of $17 million. That\u2019s a number that fluctuates both ways, and generally speaking, it\u2019s in the zero to $15 million range, but this one was plus 17.","Overall, pre-tax income was higher by 11% or $106 million in the quarter coming in at $1.71 billion compared to last year's $965 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in the quarter third quarter this year came in at 28.8%, compared to last year's reported tax rate of 26.8. Now, last year of course on a normalized basis, I mentioned that we had that $82 million tax benefit related to the potential dividend. Last year's normalized rate was 35.3. For fiscal 2019, based on our current estimates, which of course are always subject to change, we anticipate our effective total company tax rate for the entire year with the change in U.S. tax rates benefiting the entire year.","The tax rate to be approximately 28%, as we will have the full fiscal year under the new U.S. Federal rates. Before I leave the subject of tax law changes, I'll make a couple of comments on that in terms of what our plans are viz-a-viz the savings. As I had mentioned last quarter end, we really don\u2019t expect any major changes to our capital allocation plans. We generate good cash and pretty much do the things that we want to do, in terms of expansion and in terms of regular dividend and in terms stock buybacks as well.","As mentioned on last year's earnings call, I said we would use some of the income tax savings in the U.S. to benefit our U.S. employees and that there will be increases in the early wage rates. Effective June 11, our U.S. starting wages will increase from 13 and 13.50 an hour to 14 and 14.50 an hour. So, $1 an hour for entry level. With all other hourly warehouse employees receiving hourly increase of anywhere from $0.25 to $0.50 per hour.","The estimated annualized cost of these increases will impact about 130,000 plus employees in the United States, will be $110 million to $120 million pre-tax, with Q4 being impacted by little more than $25 million pretax. We have been investing, second, next we have been investing and we will continue to invest some of the savings to drive our business. This will certainly include investing in price, as well as other activities. Some of the tax savings this way will fall in the bottom line indirectly by investing and driving value and sales. And then some of the tax savings will go straight to the bottom line.","A few other items of note, in terms of expansion, I mentioned we have 15 total openings scheduled for the upcoming 16-week fiscal fourth quarter, which include two re-lows. So, we will have 13 net openings. That would put as at 21 net new openings for the fiscal year. 25 total, less four re-lows. In Q1, we opened seven locations net of five. In Q2, we opened one. In Q3, as I mentioned, we opened two. And for all of fiscal 2018, again, the 21 net-new. Of those 21 net-new, little under two-thirds of them will be in the U.S.","Additionally, for fiscal 2018, we will relocate before, all of those in the U.S. and those were relocated to better and larger facilities. As of Q3-end, total warehouse square footage stood at $108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks in Q3, $54 million was expanded. So, Q3 year-to-date for the 36 weeks we repurchased $233 million worth of stock or 1.337 million shares at an average price of 174.30 per share.","In terms of our e-commerce activities. E-commerce, we currently operate e-commerce sites in the U.S., Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Total e-commerce sales for the third quarter were up 37% year-over-year. And again, that was Q3 of 36.8, year-to-date 36.1 and for the four weeks of April, which we have previously reported was up 43.1%. We continue improving and slightly expanding our offerings.","We have been helped of course by improved member service and better search and check out and returns processes, but first and foremost we\u2019re delivering greater value to members and more people are actually are looking at it, opening their emails and transacting. This stuff works and we will continue to see \u2013 we believe to see some good results there. In the third quarter, our site traffic conversion rates and orders will continue to improve year-over-year and again we would expect that to continue at least in the near-term.","Online grocery, both our dry grocery two-day delivery and our same-day fresh delivery through Instacart both of these were rolled out last October and continue to grow nicely. Still a small percentage of the total company, we are growing and we're seeing good things from it both in existing markets, plus in some cases in markets where an existing Costco might be a little further away.","We continue to improve the online merchandise and services offerings with hot buys and buyer picks with buy online and pick up in store, some limited big-ticket items, like jewelry tapped with some laptops, and most recently handbags. One other additional comment on that is we\u2019re seeing that plus or minus half, about half, a little under little over of those people will come in and shop as well before they pick up the item. Another example of how we\u2019re seeing some of the stuff benefit of the benefit as I have given examples in the past, most recent probably good example is household furniture.","Historically, this was only in warehouse in generally for eight or so weeks per year. Now, it\u2019s online or 52 weeks and we're seeing good increases in sales there, incremental sales, similar to our success in selling appliances that I have discussed in the past. Overall, all these efforts are positively impacting our business both online and in warehouse that are helping our sales momentum and increasing member awareness of our digital presence at the same time. We are seeing good traffic increases and hopefully we can continue these types of activities. ","Overall, omnichannel is certainly working to enhance and increase our business. One last example, we know how in 220 of our roughly 520 U.S. locations where I\u2019ll call e-commerce product showcases and online ordering capabilities. All U.S. locations will have something in place by this year's upcoming fall holiday season.","In terms of upcoming releases, we will announce our May sales results for the four weeks ending June 3 next week on June 6, and our fiscal 2018 fourth quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 16-week fourth quarter ending September 2. This will be after the market closes on Thursday October 4, with the earnings call that afternoon at 2 PM Pacific time.","I do want to point out that last year, fiscal fourth quarter were 17 weeks, this year it is 16 weeks. So, keep that in mind as you plan in your numbers. As a reminder, last year's fourth quarter was 17 weeks as I mentioned.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A, and Josh I\u2019ll turn it back over to you for that.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Simeon Gutman","Hi, Richard. My first question is on the gross margin. The core on core has been roughly flattish to down a little bit low single digits, I think you said down four, I don't you don't guide to it, but I wanted to ask if that\u2019s roughly the ballpark that we should think about or is that a consequence of just how the margins of the business and the sales play out?","Richard Galanti","Starting with the first part of the question was, I know you don't want to comment on it. Look at the end of the day, there is lot of moving parts to it. All I can tell you is, we\u2019ve been fortunate to have a few different buckets of monies to be able to do a lot of things starting with the credit card transition, continuing with membership fee increase, continuing with the income tax and you add a little too that some of the Sam's closings. All these things we were able to do. We feel very good about what we're doing and the other thing is, as you have all heard over the years, when costs are going up, we want to be the last to go up and when prices are going down, the costs are going down we want to be the first to go down. ","When you look at some of the things that have happened where there is inflationary freight costs, those things generally are now in there, but we, we pride ourselves on holding off on some of those things. So, I can't really tell you where we will go at this other than we feel good about what we\u2019re doing. Keep in mind also that some of this has to do with not just core on core, but some of the penetration, the sales penetration of things like low margin gas. We feel really good about where we are pricing wise and what we're doing with it and driving our business. ","Simeon Gutman","And the 110 to 120 of pretax wage investments, do you think about investment in price any differently or the two are unrelated in the way you manage the business?","Richard Galanti","Well there are two and keep in mind, given that the income tax changes were unique and don't happen every day we certainly felt the right thing to do was to allow it certainly to help our employees as well as drive our business and improve the member value. I look at how we have done it. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019ve done and where we\u2019re going with it, but we don't look at and let\u2019s take a third, a, third and a third. This is just how we're doing it. And we want to, we recognize that there is a lot of things to be able to do it, and if you go back years ago, when they looked at my comment on some will fall in the bottom line, we view that as part of the process here to.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Your line is open.","Michael Lasser","Good evening and thanks a lot for taking my question. So, when you look at the e-com transaction, how are those impacting your profitability, both e-commerce transaction itself and those that are being picked up in stores that half of those include a shop and visits to the warehouse.","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, the buy online and shop in stores is some limited high ticket small size items, where in many cases we find members would love to buy it, but didn't want to, couldn\u2019t have it delivered to where they worked, didn\u2019t want to leave it on their doorstep. And what we found is, which we were a little surprised by is when they do come in, a lot of them come in and shop first and then pick it up, and shop quite a bit frankly. It\u2019s a small piece of the business. We\u2019re not looking to have people come in and have to refrigerate stuff while and order online and then we have got to have refrigerators and freezers filled waiting for them to come. These are limited areas where we think we can drive business and provide that member service.","Michael Lasser","And is it having an impact on your margin structure at this point? ","Richard Galanti","No, not really. Keep in mind, like a lot of companies out there, we're doing a lot of things. If you think about what we're doing with the two delivery things, there is some inefficiencies are starting it up and ramping it up and buying equipment for box making and whatever else. We're not really talking about all these little things, but there is things there. But no \u2013 when we're doing some of the things, hot buys, some of that is our vendors, and some of that is - some of the monies that we have to be able to use. As I mentioned before, I think that for every dollar that we had to use, we feel we get kind of a bigger bang for that buck than others simply because of limited targeted items.","Michael Lasser","And my follow-up question is, this year's third quarter ended a week later into May and began a week later in February, so you probably got a higher volume week and gave up a lower volume week, did that calendar shift effect have any impact on your sales and profitability in the third quarter?","Richard Galanti","Not for the quarter, no.","Michael Lasser","Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Grom with Gordon Haskett. Your line is open.","Chuck Grom","Hi, thanks Richard. On the digital front, any learnings so far from Costco grocery in particular, are you seeing a new shopper or is it an existing shop that\u2019s making an incremental purchase and then separately can you remind us of the SKU count online today and where you see it going forward?","Richard Galanti","Well on the last question on the SKU count, I think it\u2019s approaching 10,000. We don't see it getting a lot bigger, but you keep in mind over the last couple of quarters we\u2019ve added lots of what I call velocity items, food and sundries items, health and beauty aid items, some apparel items, which is getting people to open their emails if you will and think about coming back more often to take a look without us having to remind them. And so, all those things we will continue to see. And I'm sorry the first part of the question?","Chuck Grom","[Indiscernible]","Richard Galanti","I think, it\u2019s really too early to tell. We clearly are getting some customers, in the case of the two day, which is dry, it covers the entire continental United States. We are picking up some members that we never had before because we are 50 to 100 miles away from the nearest physical Costco, and we're really just, and I talked in the last quarter about there has really been very limited marketing of that as we\u2019re just getting it up and running and rolling it out. We, and it is too early to tell what impact if any it has in terms of same-day grocery. Historically, we saw in some early cases back in like the Bay area, which did not refresh by the way, you saw perhaps an existing member shop a few less times that year, but shopped several times online, in some cases there is this fill-ins and they are still coming in. The sum of the two was still better, a little better than it was before. I think we will have to have see. As you might expect, we're going to figure out how to do it. So, it is not, it benefits us in some ways, that I think we're fortunate that some traditional retailers don't have that same benefit.","Chuck Grom","Okay, thank you. And then just on, it has been a while since you\u2019ve updated us on your long-term club goals, just curious where you see saturation, where do you think you could see the club base looking out maybe 5 and 10 years?","Richard Galanti","Well we have to see. 21 this year is probably a few less than we had thought we will be able to get done. Some of that is couple of delays, some of it is international, it takes a little longer. Some of it is, our conviction particularly in the some of the newer countries. We want to grow people there and as you know if you look back at Japan, I think we got to 6 over in the first five years and fast forward several years, we are in the mid-to-high 20s. We got to 3 over 2.5 to 3 years, 2.5 years plus in Australia. So, I think you will see those numbers go up. If I had to guess and it is an honest educated guess, somewhere in the mid-20s over the next 5 years, probably a couple of year in business centers, 2 years to 3 years, who knows. ","And in terms of U.S., on the basis of 520, today in the U.S. is somewhere in the 15-ish range for the next few years and logic will say maybe it becomes a little bit, maybe it is helped a little by business centers we will have to see. We still, we keep finding and surprising ourselves as it relates to the ability to put another unit in and even getting somebody to cut their drivetime if you will to the nearest Costco from 30 minutes to 15 minutes, can be very meaningful as we have seen in places like San Jos\u00e9 and Redmond and other places. So, we will see.","Chuck Grom","Great. And then last question, just on the groceries, you said, the core and core down four, anything unusual in the quarter was there any mix pressure or any inventory issues given some of the weather and it sounds like most of the price investments have been proactive, just wondering if you guys have done a deeper dive looking to elasticity on some of those price investments?","Richard Galanti","Elasticity is not a word we will ever use or think about. We are merchants and we are constantly driving value. I think you\u2019ve heard us say before, this is all about us, who's our toughest competitor it is us. And, I think there is a little sales penetration detriment in the number and that was part of that. But again, there is lots of moving parts and pieces not just core on core but other ancillary businesses and again I got to tell you, we feel pretty good about our pricing ability and our ability to drive the bottom-line through good sales and the like.","Chuck Grom","Great. Thanks, and good luck.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","John Heinbockel","So Richard a couple of things maybe along the lines of convenience, when you think about both this inside the box, it has been much thought about doing more items and maybe bulkier items that take up space that kind of get them out of the cart, pick them up on your way out and if so would that, do you guys think that would lead to more items per shopping trip, if people were kind of buying paper and beverage not in the box, but on the way out or in the lot?","Richard Galanti","The short answer is, no. I mean, will there be some things added to the buy online and the pick of store, I'm sure there will be few other things, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019re saying, hey what else can we do there. We're doing a little of that because the few things that we have done have worked, but also take something simply as bulk paper goods and bulk order. It\u2019s kind of like where is that located in warehouses? In the back, what does that make you do? It makes you go through the whole warehouse. Not unlike having the fresh foods at the supermarket in the back, as we do as well. So, I think there is lots of different ways you can skin that cap and I don't see us doing a lot of that. I'm sure it will change and increase somewhat over time.","John Heinbockel","Okay. And then secondly, you think about, I think in the past, maybe the topic of smaller box size comes up, but you\u2019ve always liked the economics of the large club, so if you think about maybe a box that\u2019s half as big more convenient playing in the what\u2019s for dinner tonight space to a greater degree does that ever become an attractive option for you or not just because the economics don't match the big box?","Richard Galanti","Never say never, but it is not on the plate right now, I mean, it\u2019s not even on the second page of the plate. So, we feel we\u2019ve got plenty going on in terms of regular sized boxes and big sized boxes in terms of business centers, in terms of some vertical things that we're doing like in the fresh and the protein area, some more things you want on a private label, and would delivery. I mean, we have got a lot of good \u2013 in our view good things going on and pretty happy that there is plenty of regular sized box opportunities.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Short with Barclays. Your line is open.","Karen Short","Hi, thanks. Couple of questions. I just want to clarify, I guess in terms of the tax dollars, you know you did say dollars would go to investing in price. So, I guess the first question I have is, a, you now asking about the gross margin a little differently, was that something that maybe tick up a little bit this quarter because you did mention fresh margins were down this quarter and I think they were up in the prior quarter, or should we kind of expect to see a little bit more pressure on the core gross margin going forward as you do take those dollars and invest?","Richard Galanti","I cannot tell you where it'll go in the future. What I can tell you is that it is not just the tax dollars, it is the credit card, it is the mem fee increase. There is a lot of things going on out there and we have been able as freight costs have skyrocketed in the last year for everybody to hold that a little bit, absolutely. Ultimately, we have got to catch up on that and we feel comfortable holding it and catching up at some point as we have. And so, I think we feel, all I could tell you is, we feel quite comfortable as to what we're doing and how we're doing it, and that we feel very comfortable that we are our own toughest competitor and we control those about a little bit at this point. We don't know what\u2019s going to happen in the future, but I don't think that\u2019s changing very quickly as we come up with new things to do.","Karen Short","Okay. And so, I guess I was also wondering, I mean obviously you\u2019ve had unbelievably strong sales now going on almost a year, but more recently I guess what I'm wondering is, do you think that the strength in sales is just a function of strong or not that you weren\u2019t executing before, but stronger execution and price points or do you think there is some benefit that you're seeing from a consumer perspective from tax dollars, tax refund dollars in their pockets, do you have any color on that?","Richard Galanti","The only color we get is, it relates to tax reform dollars is what we \u2013 what you and I and others here and read in the paper. As you hear from some economists, certainly we\u2019ve heard from some of our business partners whether it is the credit card issuers and networks or other types of third parties. And it seems like there is a little there, but it\u2019s hard to really dictate that. We know that pricing, investing in price works, and we know that it tends to work generally very well such that even in working with suppliers and in some cases, we will partner with them to get to that do just a lower price point as it drives more volume, you know not have to take on any of that ourselves.","So, there\u2019s lots of different ways to do it, but I think that one of the things that we have commented on of course is also some of the low hanging fruit and benefits that we have because of the things we hadn't done historically. You look at the examples of appliances and look at the examples of furniture, used to be if you wanted to buy household furniture items, if you don't have a truck you will get one and call your friend because we don't deliver. That has changed anyway, but even so we're still doing very well in-store for those 8 or 10 weeks of this example, but all of a sudden, we have got 40 plus more weeks where we are doing truly incremental business in the hundreds of millions of dollars and growing. Those are the things that I think that make us additional, it\u2019s not just price, price is in the top of our list, but beyond that there is other things that I think are benefiting us. Certainly, fresh foods and what we have done there in terms of the quality and the consistency and coming up with new items.","Karen Short","Great. Okay. And then last question from me, just inflation at core and at retail at this quarter?","Richard Galanti","I think on the food and sundries side, it has picked up a little bit, and again talking to the buyers is a big chunk of that has to do with freight and I think one of the analyst reports out there and the title is called frightening changes to cost, but at the end of the day it rains on all of us and I think on the food and sundries side it was up in the 2% to 3% range and probably two-thirds of X it was more related to freight related costs.","Karen Short","And that\u2019s at cost or at retail and both?","Richard Galanti","That\u2019s at cost. Needless to say, if there is 35%, 40% of your business, 200 or more cost basis and core or core is down four, ultimately you got to pass that on, and ultimately, we have some additional monies to be able to use towards that to be more competitive and so.","Karen Short","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Baird. Your line is open.","Peter Benedict","Hi, thanks Richard. The move on wages, is that, does that effectively pull forward what you might have done or what was likely to happen, I guess next spring when I think you guys do for the next employment agreement?","Richard Galanti","If you look back over many, many years. We have a three-year employee agreement. The last one was March 2016. So, the one important thing in there of course is where do our topics scale hourly employees move each March of 2017 and 2018 and 2019, that\u2019s prescribed in that March 2016, new employee agreement. And so that\u2019s prescribed, and historically we\u2019ve always done something in top of scale. I don't see that changing. We have once or twice moved the bottom of the scale up. We will see where tomorrow brings, this probably won't be the last time, particularly and so we will have to see, but we, I don't, we really looked at it independently of that, ultimately if you're going to do something and if you're doing something now, it doesn't mean you're not going to do something on top of that next time and again I am not trying to be coy. I expect whatever most people are going to do we're going to do a little more.","Peter Benedict","Not that make sense, a quick question on the competitive tone in the market, I mean you just got done saying earlier that you're always your toughest competitor, but maybe can you comment on what you're seeing as you guys are looking at some of your competitors or the big club or non-club with all these tax dollars moving around or are you noticing them being sharper in any areas?","Richard Galanti","You know, I honestly believe while there has been some, I think all companies, not just in retail tend to, I am sure many companies feel that one there is a desire to use some of this to help employees to share that wealth if you will, to drive their business. I don't think it has been life changing for any company, and since that, one of the questions we were asked right after the announcement that we said that on an annualized basis next year, if you do simple map roughly 7 percentage points of our effective rate from the 35-ish to the 28-ish on you take the pretax dollars it is some low $300 million after tax benefit. ","And somebody asked a question about does that mean you might do a special dividend? Well our special dividends, the three that we\u2019ve ever done are the $2 billion to $3 billion cost range. So, this really doesn't change anything there. We\u2019re already generating cash flow to do other things, and maybe we are in the higher quartile then we will position financially, but I think overall [indiscernible] from what I have read does it help the consumer? Sure, it helps the consumer. Some of the consumers as employees are benefiting from it and all that is good. Certainly, competition in general is benefiting consumers in terms of pricing. We are fortunate that pricing mode continues to widen to our benefit.","Peter Benedict","Okay, thanks for that and my last question is just around the executive membership numbers. Those were growing, call it high single digits in the past, even last year, this year they are starting to grow more like mid-single, some deceleration there, can you just talk about maybe the opportunity to continue to grow executive membership here in the U.S. and then thoughts on maybe when you could be adding that to some newer markets internationally? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well in terms of total membership we feel again pretty good about it is probably depends on when you are opening and where you are opening and the last couple of quarters we have opened three units I think in the last two quarters, we got a bunch coming. It also depends where you are opening. As you know, I've given the examples of where we have done and infill in a very strong market like San Jose area or Redmond, Washington area in Seattle. We might average in 3 existing locations 60,000 or 65,000 members per building at only 3,000 to 5,000 new members in that new building but add net of cannibalization $100 million to $120 million of annual sales in the first new year, first 12 months of that new opening. And so that is all about being close to your customer and driving more business. What was the first part of your question again?","Peter Benedict","[Indiscernible] how much core opportunity in that internationally?","Richard Galanti","I'm sorry. The other thing is as we have said that you are aware of, in international we tend to do outsized number of signups. Again, there has been as many as right now. Lastly, I mean we have done, I think in the past three or four many social group on type activities and they were quite well, so well that we don't want everybody to get used to it, so we don\u2019t do that often. We actually just started one yesterday for a two-week period, and so that will help a little bit this quarter as we are opening 13 or whatever number of new units, as we are opening a couple more international ones. So, all those things, when we look at, one of the questions we have been asked in the last couple of quarters was membership, new membership growth has slowed a little bit.","When you look at existing warehouses net of cannibalization take out all the cannibalized units that where new and the ones that those new ones cannibalize in those markets. We are still seeing a number in terms of member growth per warehouse in the high threes, mid-to-high threes I believe, 3.7, 3.8. I think it was 4 six months ago. That certainly gives us comfort and we feel it should give you. In terms of executive, I think on a weekly basis forever it seemed like it was like 20,000 a week, 22,000 a week, I think there are a couple of quarters where it was in the mid-teens or maybe in the low double digits. So, it has come back from that to 2019. In terms of, some of that is ultimately you do saturate a little bit, but part of it also, in terms of new countries, we currently operate in U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico, and I think if you just looked at simply how many units we have in each of those markets, certainly Mexico and U.S. is not an issue. We are in the low-to-mid-30s in the UK, and in low-to-mid-30s in the Mexico. And part of that is you need kind of a critical base because of the services that you offer that also is not just a 2% reward, it is the services you offer for it. I would guess that you will see in other countries, and that will help a little bit in terms of driving that, but probably more will come from us driving the value of it.","We have seen some improvement when people realized that, if I sign up for the Executive Member Card and I sign up for the co-brand Citi Visa Card that\u2019s not only the 2% from Costco, but the 2% from \u2013 on the average or whatever it is from Citi Visa and if I buy a TV that way it is a four-year warranty not a two-year warranty. So, all those things get people, the card business, I mean last year we represented over 0.5 million new car sales and if you were an executive member in some of those marketing items, you got a cash card that was a few hundred dollars more than if you were a Gold Star member. Rest assured that there were people that converted for that reason and once they did, they start to look at the other benefits of it. So, all those things help. We do a better job when you sign up of getting you to sign up as an executive as best as we can.","Peter Benedict","Okay. Thanks, so much Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi. Your line is open.","Kate McShane","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I know this has been asked a couple of times, but I just want to ask it maybe in a little bit different way, but with the level of cash that have come in from the membership increases and in the tax reform, do you think your price investment is going to result in greater gap historically, given the amounts that you've been able to invest?","Richard Galanti","I think, they have. I mean, on a general picture, if you look at just the traditional grocery industry, there's more competition generally out there and have others come down in certain pricing, I think, a little. Have we come down more, yes. This is an old statistic, but I remember looking at traditional grocery markups and recognizing there's been some product additions that are higher-margin items, especially items of supermarket industry over time.","But over 20 years, this goes back a few years ago, so five years ago and 25 years ago or whatever, it seemed like generally speaking, the grocery industry was going from markups that had been in the very high teens or low-20s to the mid and high-20s. And the big home improvement companies had gone from the high-20s to the mid-30s in what is our gross margin and our markup has done, it has gone up from 10 to 12.","And in fact, it has gone up from 10 to 12, despite the fact \u2013 and some of that is not quite right. Some of that is some higher-margin businesses like travel, which has very little cost of sales, or some of the ancillary businesses like pharmacy and optical that have very little cost of sales. So relatively speaking. Cost of sales got higher markup to cover the cost of pharmacists and optometrists or what have you. So, I think, with all said and done, in our view, just looking at the pricing gap, we've done stronger. And I think we get a little more kick out of a dollar used in certain ways than perhaps others that we're fortunate in that regard.","Kate McShane","Okay, great. Thanks. And my second question was just on the international business. I wondered if you could remind us of the timeline or your expectation for profitability for France, the newer stores in France and Spain to be profitable?","Richard Galanti","Yes. I think at the store level in Spain, we\u2019re there \u2013 we\u2019re pretty much there or very close. And mind you, we charge, we own many of these locations around the world. We own 80% - around 80% of our locations. We charge a higher than current market rent factor internally just to have everything and look at all warehouses on the same schedule and I\u2019m talking about after that imputed rent factor as well. But on a store contribution level, yes. France is brand-new. Iceland is a unique brand-new in the last couple of years. Iceland is unique, because it's just been a great market for us.","So, it's done better than planned. The others are pretty much of an implant. We \u2013 if I go back, again, number of years ago, our original budget in Japan is 20 years ago was open five units and five years and we break-even or start profitability towards the end of your five or early six. We ended up opening six, and I think we were profitable near the end of \u2013 right before the end of year four. These are rough numbers. But at the end of the day that includes the cost of a central operation that's not going to grow as you go from two units to 10 units in a market, it's going to grow a lot less than five-fold.","And the pre-opening cost of a new unit and then the fact that you're also building your business. We start with a slow volume building as expected in some new countries, not all new countries. You\u2019re pricing your fresh foods as if you're doing a lot more business and you know, you're going to have some cases very low or negative gross margin sometimes of those. So, I think the timeline we're patient. We're also not going into any market and trying to get 10 or 20 openings in one year or two years. And so, it's \u2013 I think, we've done a decent job of balancing that process.","Kate McShane","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Binder","Thanks. I\u2019m Dan Binder. I had a couple of questions. First was on\u2026","Operator","Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Binder","Can you hear me?","Richard Galanti","Yes, I can hear you.","Dan Binder","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Richard Galanti","Hey, Josh? Can you hear me, Josh? Josh?","Operator","Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Richard Galanti","Josh?","Chuck Cerankosky","Richard, I can hear you. Well, this is Chuck Cerankosky.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laura Champine from Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Richard Galanti","Somebody, call him. Hold on, we\u2019re having problem with some third-party here. But Chuck why don\u2019t you go because my guess is everybody else could hear us.","Laura Champine","I\u2019m not sure he is on. It is Laura Champine, which one of us can you hear?","Richard Galanti","I can hear Laura now. So, we\u2019re going to \u2013 [indiscernible].","Operator","\u2026Kelly Bania with BMO Capital [indiscernible]. Your line is open.","Richard Galanti","Okay, guys, hold on a second. I am just calling him. Just hold on a second.","Operator","Bania, your line is open.","Kelly Bania","Hi, Richard, it\u2019s Kelly. Can you hear me? Should I go ahead or do you want to\u2026","Richard Galanti","I would wait, because I don\u2019t think Josh can hear you.","Kelly Bania","So, no problem. Sorry, I can hear you.","Richard Galanti","I think Dan Binder was the first one that did not - Dan Binder is the first one that you couldn\u2019t hear, but we could hear. So, can we go back to him.","Operator","So, you just have to get them to requeue up and I\u2019ll promote them again.","Richard Galanti","Okay. Thank you. So, go ahead.","Operator","You\u2019re welcome.","Richard Galanti","Put I back to you, Josh. Who\u2019s next?","Operator","I\u2019m sorry, this is Kelly Bania from BMO Capital.","Richard Galanti","Okay.","Kelly Bania","Okay, thanks. Thanks, Richard. Just wanted to first ask on quickly on gas, did you clarify the impact from just the mix of higher gas prices versus the actual gas margins?","Richard Galanti","We didn\u2019t \u2013 margins in terms of dollars, margins were down and we made it up in volume. And so, profitability was pretty even year-over-year.","Kelly Bania","Got it. Okay. And then just also wanted to go back to the comments on the food and sundries, inflation \u2013 the cost inflation, I guess that\u2019s way driven. Are you seeing any acceleration in that? Are you not quite passing all that \u2013 all of that along? Do you see your competitors passing along? Do you see that kind of accelerating as more of these vendors that maybe our feeling or starting to push that through?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think, a general comment would be as is, what \u2013 whatever input \u2013 cost input item is inflationary we\u2019re going to hold off longer than others, but ultimately, you\u2019ve got to do it. And we like any other retailer would push back to the vendor and try to figure out smarter ways to do things. And \u2013 but overall, I \u2013 it\u2019s a small delay. Don't \u2013 we're noble, but we're not crazy, so.","Kelly Bania","I guess, do you think \u2013 I mean, do you think this could result in some just broader food inflation over the next several quarters? That was just we haven't seen in the long time.","Richard Galanti","I think you\u2019ll see that generally. I mean, if costs are up 2% to 3% input cost on the food and sundries side, a big chunk of that is freight related. Ultimately, that's going to compel. Now some of that will also compel to private label in some cases. In our case, we generally see this as a positive because we can be a little tougher on pricing in terms of being \u2013 and being more competitive.","Kelly Bania","Got it. And then just one more on the online grocery, the non-perishable's offering.","Richard Galanti","Hold on. [Indiscernible] Josh?","Operator","Yes.","Richard Galanti","We had a couple of calls externally here that people in our office that are \u2013 they cannot here the call all of a sudden, so while we continue here, can you check, see what's going on there?","Operator","Certainly, not a problem, I\u2019ll look into that for you.","Richard Galanti","Okay. Thank you. Go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Kelly Bania","Okay. I\u2019ll ask one more, maybe while others are getting back in queue. Just on the non-perishable's offering, how do you feel about the process of fulfilling those and scaling that over time? Do you think you need anymore \u2013 any sort of automation technology to fulfill those orders and make that profitable longer-term, or are you happy with the way that process is working?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, this stuff is profitable. It's small, it's growing nicely. But it's \u2013 we have capacity within our business centers, which we already set up to do buy online and actually deliver this way. It's just you had to buy some box-making machinery. And the good news for us is that, we feel that, A, there yes. Ultimately, God willing, we'll have to build new facilities or additional facilities for this.","Just like when we started, we had one e-commerce fulfillment facility in Mira Loma that covered the whole country years ago. And so, yes, there\u2019s a trade off. But I think that, A, we feel very good about how we\u2019re doing it that we can be profitable almost from the start other than things we\u2019re doing to invest and driving the business and marketing it and things, and it will be fine. Again, I think, we\u2019re fortunate in that regard with so few items, it\u2019s lot easier to do these things.","Kelly Bania","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Dan Binder","Hi, it\u2019s Dan Binder. Thanks. Thanks, because if you are getting me back in the queue there. I had two questions. First was on the benefit that you\u2019re seeing in clubs where you've had competitor closings. Obviously, there were a lot. So I\u2019m just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the comps benefit and the membership benefit?","And then my second question was around price investment, a little bit different angle. Just trying to understand more about couponing versus everyday low price. I think, it was probably a year or so, maybe a little over year ago, where you had backed off, I think, on the vendor items a little bit that hurt the comps and then you kind of brought it back. I\u2019m just curious as you think about price investment going forward, will it be more through the vendor mailer or more through EDLP?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, if we go back to \u2013 just to clarify one thing. If we go back to \u2013 it was Q2 of last year when there was a little disappointing and a lot of it had to do with is the stuff that we did to change the MVM and take some items and test with vendors everyday low pricing or \u2013 and some greater values, but still be at the table in the MVM, maybe a few hot picks as well. And more of the offset to that that we didn\u2019t anticipate on a negative standpoint was fewer MVM days.","So, if you went down, I think, it was the four week reporting month of February of 2017, 28 days. We had eight less MVM days. The MVM items themselves did as expected more lift, more value to the member and less gross margin per item, but more gross margins dollars to us. So that work nice. But by having those significantly fewer days of having something that is a promotional thing that gets member in the door and we change that. It took us two months to change that and since then it\u2019s been fine and, of course, it's gotten better than that since then.","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any magic. If there were an exact formula that we knew, we would tell anybody. But at the end of the day, we keep trying different things with different vendors and see what works and doesn\u2019t. I think, we have kind of settled on a mix that it includes all of the above and we\u2019ll keep them trying to figure out how to drive that in different ways.","So again, I don\u2019t see there\u2019s a big shift. The shift was over a couple of years perhaps leading up to a February of 2018 or the late calendar 2016, there was over 20 years some of the stuff gets \u2013 some of the sales lifts of an item gets a less people waiting for that regular thing every twice a year for three weeks waiting. And so, a, the values have to be greater to drive more lift and, b, we got to shake it up a little bit.","And I think it\u2019s \u2013 the good news is work with vendors. We\u2019re not just forcing vendors to try something, try one thing versus another. We\u2019re working with our vendors hopefully that do well for both of us and even partner with them when there's a little indigestion on how much additional savings. And so we can show them the type of unit lift that will be \u2013 that will generate and sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn\u2019t [Technical Difficulty] were a couple or three Sam's closing in the existing Sam's market. So they were just adding a lot of those sales to other units they already had.","Our view was as we get 10% to 20% of it and we have of what we guess their sales would be. Some of it is not our member. Some of it is \u2013 we're too far away from that member, maybe that was on the other \u2013 it was 10 miles from the other side of the existing Sam's Club and we\u2019re 10 miles, the other way is now 20 miles just too far. In some cases, the business went to another existing Sam's in the market.","We definitely saw some benefit in the membership, number of members. Again, not huge, but certainly helps and\u2026","Dan Binder","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Your line is open.","Chuck Cerankosky","Hi, Richard. Going on a little update on the food manufacturing projects you have underway. The construction, where is that at? And then I want to ask another question about the online.","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m sorry, ask that first question again?","Chuck Cerankosky","You\u2019ve got a couple of food plants under construction, where are we at on those and in the special opening days?","Richard Galanti","Well, the bakery commissary in Canada is open and running. I would say, it will take a year plus to get it to increase capacity and everything. But that's going as planned. Our chicken plant in Nebraska is a year-and-a-half away, a year plus, it's under construction. But it\u2019s all planned on a relative term in terms of we know it's going to take a year plus to get there, but it\u2019s doing fine. Anything else, guys?","Unidentified Company Representative","[Indiscernible]","Richard Galanti","We opened outside of Chicago in March, Illinois, a second meat plant, basically a sister plant, if you will, in the one in Tracy, California that we had forever. And the good news there is the Tracy one along with the added capacity at the hotdog plant at the same property location were at capacity basically and we pushed that over.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. You mentioned before you had 10,000 SKUs online. Is that the count all the time? And then when you look at how you remerchandise the online assortment over the course of the year? How often are you changing that? It seems like the e-mail and promotional activities picked up. But what is the cadence to refresh the mix in assortment that you have?","Richard Galanti","Well, look, I think, A, it's not unlike in warehouse. The exception is, of course, online. We want to be a little resistant to just climbing, because it's virtually easy, because it still has cost. We've added velocity items. We've added sundries and some shelf-stable items to delivery, that's another avenue as well. I think, it will ebb and flow. Don't expect any great change to what you're seeing now other than a constant evolution of that.","The other thing is, in some cases, there\u2019s products and vendors that will sell us online that weren't prepared to sell certain things in store. And sometimes, you'll have to be a member to get to the price online at Costco, which is fine. Our member understands that and they\u2019re going to to and see it.","Chuck Cerankosky","All right. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m going to take two more questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Champine with Loop Capital. Your line is open.","Laura Champine","Great. Thanks for taking my question. On the private label business, I mean, obviously, a lot of clubs have been streamlining the number of brands they offer. Kirkland has used almost throughout Costco. But there are some other brands like the Charisma and some of the textiles. Why not go for Kirkland across the Board? And do you have goals on how much of your sales you\u2019d like to drive through that private label brand?","Richard Galanti","Unfortunately, our head merchant is traveling to an opening today in California or is that an opening day in California. I\u2019m not sure and in my mind, Kirkland Signature is it to the extent there's a brand called Charisma, but it's not our brand. I know it\u2019s not \u2013 the way it\u2019s not our brand. Now maybe it\u2019s a brand it\u2019s not as well noticed as others, but that\u2019s not our brand. Kirkland Signature is the only brand you can see in Costco.","Laura Champine","Got it.","Richard Galanti","As it relates to how much, what I guess it\u2019s Kirkland Signature label but excluding that, which is 10%-plus of our sales. It\u2019s about 25% - 24% plus of our sales, where we wanted to go, I don\u2019t know where we wanted to go. We\u2019ll increase, yes. Years ago, I said, well, you\u2019ll never see it on this and then now it\u2019s on that. But at the end of the day, we still want brands and we still cover it and our members certainly value brands as well. In our view, it enhances our brand value. But there\u2019s a 24, it keeps increasing to the 25 and 26, and 27, I\u2019m sure it will, but I can't tell you how long that will take.","Laura Champine","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","David Bellinger","Hey, Richard it\u2019s David Bellinger on. Just a couple of quick questions. Can you talk about regional performance in the quarter? Any weather impact on traffics that you can call out specifically? Was there any improvement towards the end of the quarter?","Richard Galanti","There weren\u2019t a lot of weather related comments eventually hold on we're still looking, real quick. It really wasn't that impactful to us.","David Bellinger","Okay and I\u2019ll just follow-up on margins as well. It seems that the major drag came from the higher gas prices this quarter. But can you help us frame what percentage of sales gas represented this quarter, I know you just mentioned was on annual basis like above 10%. If you want to get too specific can you just give us some indication how that\u2019s changed over the past few quarters and how that impacted here in Q3?","Richard Galanti","Yes, we really don\u2019t go into that level of detail. Generally speaking with gas prices go up we will make a little less margin, when they go down we make more margin, happy that they went down yesterday a little bit. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s been a good business for us in its own right as well as driving business into our warehouses. It's about 10% to 12% of our business. And I think that the thing that we like to see is, when you have total U.S. gallon gas consumption as a country everywhere be up in the very, very low single digits, our gallon increases are in the very, very high single digits or very, very low double-digits. And so that\u2019s meaningful that means that more people are coming into our place and with about half of them come into shop, you don\u2019t need more than one or two of those 50 out of every 100 to be somewhere, but incremental shop to be meaningful to our company on an ongoing basis. Aside from the business itself having a little strong [indiscernible] based on the volatility sometime day-to-day and week-to-week, but profitably, but overall it\u2019s been a good business in its own right.","David Bellinger","That\u2019s helpful, thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it.","Richard Galanti","Thank you. We\u2019re all around guys and feel free to call with any additional questions, we\u2019ll be here tomorrow as well.

My name is Karen and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn today's call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Galanti, you may begin.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Karen and good morning to everyone. Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results, events and or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","Last night's press release reported our third-quarter and year-to-date fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12 and 36-week periods that ended this past May 8. For the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.24, up 6% over last year's third-quarter earnings per share of $1.17.","In comparing our third-quarter results year-over-year, there are a few items of note. As usual, FX as compared to a year ago, during the quarter, the foreign currencies in the countries where we operate weakened overall versus the US dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea.","This resulted in our foreign earnings in Q3 when converted into US dollars for reporting purposes being lower by about $15 million, or $0.03 a share than they would have been had the various foreign exchange rates versus the dollar been flat year-over-year.","Gross margins. On a reported basis, it was higher by 34 basis points. This included a $19 million benefit from nonrecurring legal settlements. This represented 7 basis points of margin improvement, or about $0.03 a share.","Number three, our co-branded credit card transition in the United States. With the transition to our new co-brand Citi Visa card next month, co-brand AMEX credit card sign-up stopped, as you know, late last calendar year, I think in October, November.","The short-term negative earnings impact of the lost co-brand credit card sign-ups in the quarter year-over-year was about $11 million, or $0.02 a share to the negative.","We expect to have the new co-brand Visa cards in the hands of our members by the end of May, early June, some of you may have already received them in the mail - with a go live transition date of Monday, June 20.","Number four, wages. As I mentioned on last quarter's, second-quarter earnings conference call back in March, in addition to the - we do a top-of-scale increase each year, which we generally again have done every year each March.","This year, we also increased our bottom-scale hourly rates in the US and Canada, which is about 80% of our company. Effective this past March 14, we increased our starting wage at $1.50 an hour to $13 and $13.50 an hour.","The new bottom of scale wage increase results in a year-over-year incremental payroll expense of about $6 million, or $0.01 a share in the quarter. We estimate that this will be anywhere from $0.01 to $0.02 a quarter in each of the next three quarters depending on which way it rounds.","Number five, IT modernization. IT modernization efforts negatively impacted SG&A expenses in Q3 on an incremental year-over-year basis by about $16 million, which is about 5 basis points, or $0.02 a share to SG&A.","I believe in the first and second quarters this year that year-over-year delta of modernization expense was 7 basis points to the negative in Q1 and 3 in Q2. So it looks like it's averaging around 5 a quarter for the first three quarters of the year.","LIFO. This year in Q3, we picked up a little bit there from a LIFO credit. We recorded a pretax LIFO credit of $13 million in the quarter. Last year, it was also deflationary, but as you know deflation has continued. It was $7 million, so again about a $6 million, or a penny a share delta there. Those are the items I'd point out.","Turning to our third-quarter sales, total reported sales, as you know, as reported, was up 2% and our 12-week reported comp sales figure was flat or zero. Sales, of course, were negatively impacted by gasoline price deflation.","That was almost 2 percentage points impact and about 190 basis points and by the weakening foreign currencies relative to the dollar that I just mentioned. That was about 145 basis points.","So excluding gas deflation, the flat US comp number we reported would have been a plus 3%. In Canada, the plus 1% reported Canadian comp would've been a plus 8% in local currency, excluding gas deflation and flat FX rates. And the reported minus 2% other international, excluding gas deflation and assuming flat over year FX, that would've been a plus 3%. So all told, our reported zero comp for the quarter, ex-gas and FX, would have been a plus 3%.","In terms of new openings, in the quarter, we opened 7 new locations and also completed one relo. So year-to-date for the first 36 weeks, we've opened a total of 19 new warehouses and 3 relos. For all of 2016, we have a current plan of 29 net new locations; a little over two-thirds of them, 21, will be in the US; two in Canada; two in Japan; and one each in the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain.","This morning, I will also, of course, review with you e-commerce activities, membership trends and renewal rates, additional discussion about margins and SG&A in the quarter and a couple of other items.","So going down the P&L, again, for sales. Total sales were up 2%. Reported comps flat. Reported, up 3%, excluding gas and FX. Now the zero flat comp on a reported basis was a combination of an average transaction decrease of a little under 3%, minus 2.7%, on a reported basis.","And again ex-gas and FX, the average transaction increase would've actually been up 0.5%. And the average shopping frequency increase was up 3% for the quarter, which is most of February, all of March, all of April and a little of May.","In terms of sales comparisons by geography, in the US, Texas, Midwest and South East regions were the stronger ones. Internationally in local currencies, better performing countries were Mexico, Canada and the UK.","In terms of merchandising categories for the quarter, within food and sundries, which was overall flattish year-over-year, sundries, foods and meat, deli were the leaders. Tobacco, as I think we mentioned a little bit on the April sales call, was negative in the low teens as we continue to eliminate tobacco from various locations.","For hardlines overall in the mid-single digits. The departments with the strongest results were sporting goods, toys, seasonal, automotive, consumer electronics and garden\/patio. I think I will have to go look at what was down because those were all pretty good departments within hard lines.","Within low to mid-single softline comps, single-digit softline comps, small electronics, men's apparel and home furnishings were the standouts. And lastly, in fresh foods, comp sales overall in the low single digits. Produce and deli showed the best results. Of course, we probably had the most deflation I think in the meat, poultry and pork areas.","In the US, we continue to see deflation in the low single digit range for food and sundries, and as I mentioned fresh foods, and a little in some of the non-food areas as well, notably electronics.","Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in - in dollars were up 6% and up 7 basis points as a percent of sales, coming in up $34 million from $584 million last year to $618 million.","Again, FX currencies, exchange rates impact this number. Without FX, we are assuming flat year-over-year FX. The $618 million would have been up $7 more million and so the 6% dollar increase year-over-year would have been up 7. Same number of basis points, of course, up 7.","In terms of renewal rates, we continue at strong renewal rates, 90% plus in the US and Canada, 88% worldwide. Continue increasing penetration of the executive membership and I will talk about that in a second.","New member signups in the quarter companywide were at 15% year-over-year in part driven by strong sign-ups at our new openings in Taiwan and Japan. The Asia openings always have outsized new sign-ups. We also had very strong sign-ups in Tulsa, for that matter. Overall, in the US, in fact, it was up 15% as well.","In terms of number of members at third quarter-end, Gold Star was 36.2 million, up from 12 weeks earlier at 35.4 million; primary business, the same at 7.2 million; business add-ons, the same at 3.5 million at the beginning and the end of the quarter. So all told, 46.9 million member households, up 800,000 from 46.1 million at Q2 end.","Total cardholders is 85.5 million, up 1.5 million from 84 million at the end of the second quarter. I mentioned executive memberships. We came in at the end of Q3 with right at 17 million executive members, which is an increase of actually 402,000 over the 12 week period, or 33,000 a week increase in the quarter.","I think that tends to be on the high end of that weekly increase in many of the last recent quarters, executive members are approximately 36% of our member base and about two-thirds of our sales and continues to improve penetration.","In terms of renewal rates, business members were 94.4% at the end of the quarter, tweaked down from 94.5%; Gold Star, 89.6%, a tenth down also, 89.7%; and so total US and Canada, 90.4%, down from 90.5%, worldwide, at 87.6% at the end of the quarter, again a tenth down as well.","Within the US and Canada, of course, we've seen a bigger tickdown than a tenth of a percent in Canada. That has to do with as we anniversary now about 18 months when we initiated the change in credit cards up there, which was actually everybody having to sign up again.","So I think part of that is the auto renewal. We see a little of that in the US since we haven't been adding on, accepting new applications for the current co-branded credit card since past October, but pretty much in line with what we thought.","In terms of gross margin, our reported gross margin, as I may have mentioned, was up 34 basis points, 11.43% this year versus 11.09% last year. And as usual, I will ask you to jot down four columns of numbers to provide a little edification here. The four columns would be Q2 2016. Columns 1 and 2 are both Q2 2016.","These are year-over-year changes in basis points. First column would be reported figures for margin. Second would be without the impact of gas deflation since that tends to distort the numbers wildly. And then columns 3 and 4 would be Q3 2016 both reported and in column 4, Q3 2016 without gas deflation.","In terms of the line items, the first line item going across would be core merchandising, so Q2 2016, we reported a plus 5 basis point year-over-year. Ex-gas deflation, it was minus 3. In Q3, reported, plus 16 and ex-gas, minus 2, ancillary, a plus 9 and a plus 7. And then columns 3 and 4, a plus 9 and a plus 4. 2% reward, minus 1 and 0.","And in Q3, reported without gas, 0 and plus 2. LIFO in the second quarter, plus 4, plus 4; in the third quarter, plus 2, plus 2. Other, 0 and 0 in the first two columns and a plus 7 in columns 3 and 4, that's those nonrecurring legal settlements I talked about earlier.","You add up those columns reported in Q2 year-over-year, we had an up 17 basis point margin and up 8 on an ex-gas deflation basis. And again, as well, we reported a plus 34. It's a plus 13 ex-gas deflation.","In terms of the core merchandise component, which again reported plus 16, but minus 2, if you look at the four key categories, which is 80% plus of our business, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods, as a percentage of their own sales, they were positive year-over-year by 16 basis points with food and sundries, hardlines and softlines all being up year-over-year and fresh foods being slightly down during the quarter year-over-year.","Ancillary and other business -- by the way, those numbers exclude the non-recurring items that I mentioned -- ancillary and other business margins were up 9 basis points, up 4 without gas and within the quarter on their own sales, gas, optical and hearing aids all showed higher gross margins year-over-year as a percent of their own sales.","I mentioned LIFO already. That was a 2 basis point benefit year-over-year and other, again a 7 basis point improvement year-over-year. So even ex that on an ex-gas deflation basis, margins were up a few basis points year-over-year.","Moving down to expenses, SG&A. On a reported basis, were higher by 33 basis points coming in at 10.44 compared to 10.11 a year ago. Again, we will do the same four columns, Q2 reported and without gas and then Q3 reported and without gas.","Core operations, minus 22 reported year-over-year and a minus means higher year-over-year. Ex-gas in Q2 was a minus 16. Columns 3 and 4, minus 24 and minus 8. Central in Q2 was a minus 8 and minus 7; Q3, minus 6 and minus 4; stock compensation, minus 4 and minus 4 and then a minus 3 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments.","So all told, we reported year-over-year in Q2 SG&A higher by 34 basis points on a reported basis and 27 ex-gas. This quarter Q3 reported higher SG&A by 33, 14 higher ex-gas.","Basically within the -- if you go back to the core operations or operations, the ex-gas deflation, the 8 basis points year-over-year higher, that consisted of higher payroll and benefits year-over-year, which impacted that minus 8 by minus 12, so more to the minus 8.","These items were somewhat offset by a variety of other controllable expense items. Q2 is of course always the lowest volume quarter and of course, as we know, sales were a little weaker for a variety of reasons, including some inflation.","Central expense was higher year-over-year in the quarter by 6, ex-gas by 4. IT is the 4 on an ex-gas basis. It was minus 5 on a reported, but essentially ex that. Central did a pretty good job in the quarter purchasing that. And again, stock compensation expense, no surprise there.","Next on the income statement, pre-opening, a little higher year-over-year, $18 million for the quarter versus $14 million a year ago, so up by a basis point. This year in the quarter, we had 8 openings, including one relo.","Last year in the quarter, we had 4 openings, including 1 relo. Again, some of that is not necessarily related to those specific openings as it may include some right before the quarter opened as well. All told, operating income came in at $858 million for the 12-week quarter, up $37 million, or up 5% year-over-year from last year's $821 million.","Below the operating income, interest expense, interest expense came in at $30 million this year versus $31 million a year ago, essentially flat, no surprises there. Interest income and other this year was $7 million, lower by $2 million versus last year's $9 million.","Actual interest income within interest income and other was essentially similar year-over-year at about $10 million; the balance of that delta was year-over-year it was the other category coming from small foreign exchange adjustments and slight year-over-year changes in whatever other is, other earnings. No big surprise there.","Overall, pretax income was higher by 4.5%, or $36 million, coming in at $835 million, up from $799 million a year earlier. Our tax rate was a little lower or better year-over-year coming in at 34.2%, down from 35.0% last year in the third quarter.","Basically, this year's third-quarter income tax percentage benefited from again just a few positive discrete items in the aggregate going our way. That's why it was a little lower. Our normalized rate is actually just a shade over 35% in both of those quarters.","Overall, reported net income of $545 million for the quarter compared to last year's $516 million or up 5.5%.","For a quick rundown of other topics, typical topics -- well, the balance sheet is included in the morning's press release. A couple of balance sheet info items that you may not see on there: depreciation and amortization in the quarter was $291 million and $847 million year to date.","Accounts payable as a percent of inventories, on a reported basis it was 99%, a percentage point lower than a year ago at 100%. That of course includes non-merchandise payables, such as construction payables, same kind of delta. The 99% reported this year would have been at 89%, the 100% would have been at 90%, so again right around the same year-over-year.","Average inventory per warehouse was actually down about $0.5 million, or down 4%. About a third of that is FX, so almost exactly a third, $173,000 of $516,000. The rest is pretty much spread across many categories, including the impact from deflation.","If you assume, and again, you never know exactly what the deflationary cost amounts are, but if you assume a 1% deflation, you get somewhere about half of that remaining being gas and the rest being just a little lower inventories, but, again, lower year-over-year by about $0.5 million.","In Q3 in terms of CapEx, we spent $460 million during the 12-week period and essentially year-to-date we are right at $1.8 billion. I would estimate for the year we will come in at around $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion compared to fiscal 2015 total expenditures of $2.4 billion. So up $100 million to $300 million from a year ago based on whatever timing we have left here and what expenditures are made.","In terms of Costco Online, as you know, we are now in six countries -- US, Canada, UK and Mexico, plus the recently launched countries of Korea and Taiwan. In the quarter, sales and profits are up. Sales were up on a reported basis 14% in the quarter, up about 15.5% ex-FX. On a comp basis, that would be 13% and 14% ex-FX.","In terms of expansion, again, I mentioned in the quarter that we are in now, which is a 16-week quarter, we would expect to open 10 new openings plus 1 relo, and again, that would put us at 29 net new openings, 33 openings, but 4 of those were relos, so 29 overall.","In fiscal 2015, we added 23 net new units on a base of 663, so about 3.5% square footage growth. In 2016, the 29 on the new base would be about 4.5% square footage growth, slightly lower unit growth, but you tend to open a little bigger unit since you've got the relos as well.","New locations by country again, 21 in the US, 2 in Canada, 1 each in the UK, Taiwan, Australia and Spain and 2 in Japan. As of third quarter-end, our total square footage was right above 100 million at 100.7 million square feet.","In terms of stock buybacks, if you recall in Q1, we repurchased $130 million of our common stock; in Q2, $80 million. Both of those are, of course, 12-week quarters as well and in the 12-week third quarter, we purchased $136 million such that year-to-date we've spent about $346 million with an average price per share of $148.64.","If you annualized those quarters, and again, we will see what we do this quarter, but if you annualize it, we are right at $0.5 billion for the year. We'd be right at $0.5 billion for the year. We will see where we come out.","In terms of dividends, as you know, last quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend rate year-over-year to a quarterly amount of $0.45. I believe that was up from $0.40 for the prior year each quarter. That $1.80 a share annualized dividend represents a total cost to the Company of around $790 million.","Before I turn the call back to Karen for Q&A, I want to mention a slight timing change each quarter when we report our quarterly results. Many of you have asked about the fact that we report earnings the night before, usually around 6:00 Pacific time, then you've get to wait until the next morning to hear the call.","Beginning with our fourth quarter earnings release, we are going to change the timing of that release and the conference call such that, for the fourth quarter, we will issue results after the market closes on Thursday, September 29, followed up shortly thereafter with a live conference call that afternoon and a Q&A session at the end of that call.","This new schedule will be our plan for earnings releases going forward and I think it'll be helpful and certainly in response to several of your comments out there.","The last quick item, next week, we report the four weeks of calendar May sales. This is the four weeks ending this coming Sunday, May 29. I will mention to you that, based on how Memorial Day falls year-over-year, this year, Memorial falls on day one of the June retail calendar month, so this year, we have 28 days versus last year's 27 days. So that will be a little benefit. Again, we'll all point that out.","June, there's really a wash. You've got a detriment related to Memorial Day. You've got a date pick up on the other end of June with how July 4 falls, and then finally we will get through that silliness in July where we report July sales.","With that, I will open up to Q&A, and I will turn it back to you, Karen.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Oliver Chen of Cowen and Company.","Steven Zaccone","Hi. Good morning. This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two questions from us. Firstly, we wanted to get your take on the health of the customer base for you.","There is been some different trends among retailers reported thus far in earnings. Wanted to just get your sense have you seen any changes in trends or spending habits?","Second question, just wanted to get your thoughts on progress with some of the third-party partnerships in grocery delivery. How has growth in those channels performed relative to expectations and then just thoughts about expanding into new markets? Thanks very much.","Richard Galanti","Okay. Well, in terms of the customer, so far so good. We don't see any dramatic change. Many of you have asked questions or have had some concern about traffic coming down from this 4% plus number over seven years. We feel pretty good about where our numbers are. We don't really see a lot of different changes.","Interestingly, when you look at nondiscretionary items like food and sundries versus discretionary items across the nonfoods categories, including big-ticket items like furniture, electronics and the like, we've actually had, relatively speaking, a little more strength in some of those nonfood categories. So that I think allays some of any concerns that some people have had.","But generally speaking, I'd have to say our customers are still pretty healthy and we are still getting good renewal rates notwithstanding a very small impact from some of the credit card transitions and so we feel pretty good at this point about that. And certainly I feel good about some of the merchandising stuff that we've got going on.","By the way, one of the other data points I've been asked several times in the last few weeks each time we've reported sales in the last couple of months is is it deflation, is it weakness, is it dotcom, whatever.","The fact of the matter is, if you look at during the 12-week quarter on a year-over-year basis, if we just take the average items per unit in the basket going through the front end, US only, so US only, it was up 1.4%. So we are getting people to buy more items, if you will.","The average basket value is up 0.4%. The simple implication there is you've got deflation presumably -- deflationary pressures of about 1%. Now that's a good educated guess. There could be other impacts of sizes, but typically we go into bigger sizes, not smaller sizes and bigger pack sizes.","So I think overall there's probably still a little bit more deflation that we've seen over the last couple of quarters spread to other items in the nonfood category as well as we've seen.","In terms of third-party partnerships, we are pretty agnostic. We have good relationships with Google in regard to Google Shopping Express. We have Instacart, of course, Google's, in six large communities in the country -- the Bay area, the LA area and a few others and Instacart I think is now in well over 15, maybe even 20 markets where we participate with them, and also a few of the others out there.","In terms of expectations, we didn't know what to expect. I believe that we generally are the anchor tenant, if you will, in many of these opportunities where there is more than just Costco items being purchased and sold just to provide to the end consumer, and so we think it's been good.","It's still small relative to -- we still want you to come into the warehouse and we are going to still figure out how to continue to do that, but it's growing nicely and it's certainly on a small scale a bit of a help.","In terms of expansion plans, I think you asked about openings, looks like our goal is still similar next year, about 30. We will shoot for something a little over 30 and end up about 30 if history repeats itself.","We probably had a few more relative to that 30 number, a few more in the US this year than we would have anticipated if you would have asked me a few years ago. I think some of that is timing.","We've had success in the US and probably the expectation of some of the markets we've gone into in the last couple of years, if you asked me five years ago, would we be going into some of these markets where we have never been in and our competitors have been in for up to 30 years.","We've had success in those markets, whether it's Mobile or Tulsa or Toledo or Rochester and New Orleans, and so probably there's a few more in those markets on top of the few that we opened like whatever [indiscernible] number we have in the Puget Sound or LA, where they are harder to find because we are very specific locations to fill in markets. So I think that's probably one thing.","Looking at the 30 next year, and this is a guess, it's probably not two-thirds, not 21 over 29. If I had to guess, it's probably a little less than half, 50%, 52%. And again, that's a guess at this point.","Steven Zaccone","Thanks very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Good morning. Simeon Gutman. Richard, the Visa transition besides the timing that started a little later, anything else to think about? Interchange fees probably start to go down when it happens, but are there other costs that make your SG&A or any other line items elevated temporarily?","Richard Galanti","No, same old stuff that we've talked about in terms of some of those things like having not signed up new co-branded cards since last October, November. There's part of any of these equations are different pockets of income, including generating new sign-ups, new credit card sign-ups and that's been about 4 million to 5 million a month, which is easy. It used to be something and now it's nothing until June.","Other than that, no, we've just got a lot of people on our side and on the issuer side doing a lot of work to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible and we are excited about it. It's a great reward for our members improvement wise and we will keep a little of it ourselves in terms of merchant fee reduction and really there's not a whole lot \u2013 yes, cards are hitting right now in fact.","They will continue to hit, when you've got literally over 10 million pieces of mail going out, it's spread over a few week period, and I think they just started hitting. So cards should be in everybody's hands a few days to a week -- at least a few days to a week before the June 20th D day here.","And we will be able to tell you more in September on the -- late September when we do the fourth quarter earnings call, but again we are ready to go and we are excited about it.","Simeon Gutman","And then the marketing dollars, the in-store kiosks, like you said the mailing, that's -- we are not going to see a blip good or bad in the SG&A dollar run rate? There's nothing unusual that should happen as we sequence there?","Richard Galanti","Absolutely.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then my follow-up on gross margin, I think you mentioned that looking at I think it was the gasoline with the optical business, I think you said it was higher year-over-year and if that's the case, can you explain I guess how you are doing -- I thought we were cycling the hump of some of the best performing gasoline gross margin quarters a year ago. Maybe it was the mix of optical, but figure that gas is a bigger input.","Richard Galanti","Yes, it will come in Q4. This quarter was an odd quarter. It ended up being -- in the first part of the quarter, it was better than we expected and with gas prices going up and down -- going up right now, it's been a little weaker the last couple weeks, but it was probably a little stronger near the beginning and into the middle of the quarter than we had anticipated, and it's generally two things.","I think the bigger factor is, is when there's daily price changes up and down in the cost of -- procurement cost of both us and other gas station operators and then when it goes down, we seem to feel that we get a little extra margin in part because our competitors don't give as much back as fast as we do.","So we still give way more back and it helps us a little bit. And so I think part of that new normal, if you will, over the last couple of years in that regard, it's probably on average a little better.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, thank you.","Richard Galanti","You will see it in Q4 though. I say that today. Day-to-day sometimes it changes relative to what -- just when we think we are smart and it's safe to go out, it goes the other way. But so far I guess it'll impact us in Q4.","Simeon Gutman","But in Q4 being the hump and then it gets easier after that?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, great.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. My first question relates to margin. Can you just talk about the degree to which moving food prices, I guess a deflation issue, and\/or FX would've contributed to margin rate in any way?","Richard Galanti","Well, the only thing that FX does is -- needless to say, in most other countries, some of their goods are US-sourced or US-dollar payable. In Canada, it is substantial, frankly. And we manage that and we lock in, you know, in a way natural hedges during the quarter once the buyers are comfortable with that exchange rate and what they're going to be able to price it at.","But my guess is they are still - when you've got - when you look at, let's say in Canada year-over-year the Canadian dollar is 17% weaker, incrementally just in the quarter 5% weaker from the previous month. So you've got that kind of stuff going on from the previous quarter.","You are going to have probably a little margin pressure there. Notwithstanding the margins are up a little. I think generally we try to bring down prices when there's deflation and probably doesn't impact us as much because -- it impacts us a little sooner than others and that's pretty much it.","Matthew Fassler","Got it. And then LIFO, I guess, it's I think the seventh consecutive quarter where this has gone your way and I know you market to the best of your expectations at the end of every quarter.","How much of this is food, and if we think about commodity prices, I know once again this should be zero in a normative environment. Any sense of whether there's more momentum that could prove helpful to you here?","Richard Galanti","I don't think -- again, deflation from the end of the year is down about 0.8 [ph] of a percent in terms of a LIFO index. And the other comment I made, it was about 1%. Ask the question again. I was looking at one thing. Go ahead.","Matthew Fassler","I guess the question is how much of the movement in LIFO, the ongoing credits, relate to food and based on commodity prices that you see, any desire to venture a guess as to where LIFO goes next?","Richard Galanti","We don't know. If you talk to our fresh foods buyers, they are continuing to expect some deflation. I get different answers from some of the non-foods buyers. Mind you, when we look at fresh foods year-over-year, those margins were down slightly in the low double-digit basis points year-over-year, so again not a big impact there.","It's the other categories where it was up a little bit, and so the net of all those four main categories, it was up 16 basis points. I don't think there is lots...","Matthew Fassler","And then, finally, any sense thinking about the very long run about whether your food -- how your food market share moves if at all when prices are deflationary and perhaps consumers see some of the prices that they had only seen at Costco for a long time at other retailers?","Richard Galanti","Well, first and foremost, I think we continue to believe that we will continue to see increasing penetration of the stuff we sell in fresh foods. Nobody doesn't like us. The quality levels and the values are awesome and some of the things we are doing with global sourcing initiatives and poultry plants and organic -- our pounds in beef are way up, but you've got deflation in beef more than some of the other protein categories. We are the first to go down in some of those items when there is deflation.","So I think our numbers have actually -- the deflation in some of the fresh food categories I think mask some of the pound strength, if you will or the unit strength that we have whether it's protein or produce. And I would never be so arrogant to say that nobody can catch us, but we've got some great things going on in terms of again global sourcing, working with vendor partners.","And we looked at our produce today, which is I think a $6 billion business now, approaching a $6 billion business, which is as big as protein. I don't think many retail food places do those kind of numbers.","And so I think it has more to do with that than, yes, there's probably going to be a little bit of a macro shift, whatever. I think what we do and how we do it dwarfs those other impacts.","Now there's other players coming into the market. I think just this week you've got a 365 opening and you've got other people coming to town with different health-related organic-related types of retail formats.","We are pretty good at that stuff too and again, you've got to like bigger sizes, but we are pretty awesome in the fresh area and I think that will continue to -- should be for us an increased sales penetration area and something that'll keep driving our members...","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Lasser of UBS.","Matt Lasser","Thanks a lot for taking my question. Richard, you sized the P&L impact of the credit card transition at $11 million. Presumably, that's just from lost sign-up -- credit card sign-ups. Are you able to tease out any impact from spending as a result of this transition?","So for example, maybe some of the holders don't know that they can still use their card and so they put it away and that changes their behavior...","Richard Galanti","There's always going to be a little confusion. To the extent that we haven't signed up new co-brand credit card members, I don't think many members -- many people coming into sign up for a Costco membership have walked away because we don't -- they can't sign up for the new AMEX card.","If they have an AMEX card in their wallet, they can use that one. Now, to the extent that they don't have an AMEX card in their wallet, or to the extent that they -- keep in mind, not everybody that signed up for one over the last 16 years got it. It was still a credit eligibility decision that the issuer made and it'll be that way in the future.","The fact of the matter though is is that, to the extent that they signed up as a member, and again I don't think it was that impactful, somebody walking away because they can't get an AMEX card, they have to use a debit card in their wallet or cash or check.","Now, on a macro basis, does that impact some of the big-ticket items? Yes, it probably does. Although our TV sales have been pretty darn strong. So I can talk out of both sides of my mouth on this one.","Matt Lasser","So does that mean that some of the comp slowdown just may be a function of the law of diminishing returns mass taking over?","Richard Galanti","It could be. Again, the ones we can quantify easily we look at. We can drive ourselves crazy. We know that -- let's face it, in April sales when we tried to -- when we shared with many of you on our audio, it's everything. It's deflation, it's a little of the AMEX. Maybe it's getting closer to the line of maximizing marginal whatever.","At the end of the day, we are still rolling out gas stations. We are still rolling out some of the ancillary businesses. We are still opening up new warehouses. We are expanding fresh foods as we have over the last several years.","People ask us about what are some of our new areas and certainly what we do with ticketing and executive member services, all those things -- wine and spirits I think we've been surprised by that -- these are all small things, they are all needle movers, but small movements. But I've always said there's lots of little things that help us here.","Matt Lasser","And my last question is, to the extent that you've already seen some of your existing AMEX cardholders clip up their card and switch to Visa, and it's having an impact on your sales, do you think that's going to only intensify as you get closer to the June 20 transition date? So for example, are you seeing even slower trends in base so far?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, I don't think anybody's clipped up anything. They still have to use that co-brand AMEX card through June 19, and nobody can actually use the new card even if you got it in the mail until June 20. That's part of our original agreement with our previous service provider. And that's fine.","So all stuff will happen June 20 and beyond. And rest assured there's going to be a lot of stuff happening in terms of our continued communication, of course, to our members, but there's a lot of members out there that don't have chance.","About a little over 40% of our US sales were done on AMEX with I think over two-thirds of that, a little over two-thirds to half of that being on the co-branded card. Some people tend to want Delta points or Starwood points, so they are using a different one.","The same thing will happen with Visa. Our goal is to get that co-branded card, as we did successfully with the AMEX co-branded card, that to be your top-of-wallet card. We think that there's going to be a lot of things that drive that, including the people out there on blogs independently and others that look at what is currently a 3, 2, 1 is going to be a 4, 3, 2, 1, that's huge.","So my personal view is it'll be something that's not going to all hit on day one. Let's get through day one and the transition first, but it'll be something that will continue for a couple to several years.","Matt Lasser","Okay. Good luck. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So Rich, do you think this 30 annual openings, is that -- certainly you have the people and the capital to do more. Is it a real estate bottleneck, or you are comfortable at that level? Can you go solidly beyond that?","And I think internationally outside of North America as you go into more countries, you would think that there is an opportunity to do 15, 20 a year comfortably. Can you ever get to that level?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, it clearly is not capital; we have plenty of capital. I would argue we have too much capital out there. We like it that way. It's people. It is people. Years ago, I didn't depreciate it as much as I do now, particularly in these countries. If you think about in Japan, I think there was an 18-month period a few years ago where we went from 9 to 20 units in about a year and a half, two years.","It's not like we are sending a bunch of experienced warehouse managers to go open and operate and be warehouse managers in Japan from different countries. So you do that a few at the beginning and you may do it occasionally on a onesie basis, but at the end of the day, you are growing from within and developing those local country people.","And first and foremost from an international standpoint, you've got that. That can be a little bit of a challenge, and then you've got things take longer there. There are some countries that I understand are very difficult just because of zoning and restrictions that are in place, not just on us, but any big-box, even local company big boxes in the hypermarket area and the like. So it's going to take a little longer there.","The other thing -- do I think we can go above 30? Look, we shoot for low 30s and then next year we will shoot for mid-30s and you've certainly heard me say that we want to be around 30 and five years from now we should be doing 35. Maybe we will fall a little short of that, maybe we won't. But we've got more feet on the ground real estate-wise in other countries, as well as the US, than we've ever had. It does take a little longer, but we also -- could we physically open more?","Sure, but we like what we do and the way we do it. And probably we also have a comfort level that it's not like we are going to miss out. We are, in our view, the preferred flood out there, and so when we go into a market, if we take a little longer to get there, people are waiting for us. It might be a little harder, but the fact of the matter is is we feel comfortable how we are doing it.","John Heinbockel","And then, as the traffic in the US has moderated, back to what -- maybe you said you were at a level that couldn't be sustained, back at a level that can be, are there discussions internally that it is just a natural moderation, or because you talked about within the categories the 16 basis point improvement in margin that there are things you can do proactively to give more back to the member, and would that do anything to traffic? So that discussion internally about the balance of earning versus trying to maybe drive traffic a little more, can that be done?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, first quarter was -- and if you haven't seen this slide before, it's reiterated and put out here internally every day of the year and at our managers meeting, Jim used to and Craig does now, we are a top-line company, we want to drive sales. The fact that margins year-over-year are up on those categories up 16 basis points, we are not smart enough to figure out how to get there all the time. We are always going to drive margin a little bit where we can, but we do it the right way by giving most of any savings back to the customer.","If I look at our competitive stance, our pricing competitive stance, versus our direct competitors, the gap has never been wider. We could make a little more of this, but we don't. At the end of the day, we are always looking for ways to do that.","When we do membership fee changes, historically, we are always looking to give some of that back. So all of those things go into it. But at the end of the day, what helps margins? Private label, fresh food strength, some of the ancillary businesses.","All of those things are helping as well, and again, we feel -- we don't necessarily -- I got to tell you, we don't look at it and say, hey, frequency came down a little bit, or the comp is a new normal or a little bit lower. We want to do more. Even when we were doing a 4% shopping fee, how do we get it higher even though that was kind of tough.","So we are going to continue to do things in that direction and we don't necessarily worry about, well, that came down a little bit so we need an extra few basis points of margin. That's never the case around here.","John Heinbockel","All right. And then, lastly, is KS having any kind of real impact that you can see on basket size or not really?","Richard Galanti","I don't know. We keep adding -- well, we subtract and add KS items, so they live and die by the same metrics. If it's not a great item, we stop it. But there aren't any giant items like toilet paper and water, those types of things or disposable diapers, several years ago, but there are lots of little ones. I think, again, we would see that continue, the increased penetration, but at a slower rate of growth in the future as well for the same reasons.","John Heinbockel","Okay, thanks.","Richard Galanti","I don't think, getting back to your question, I don't think that's a big reason of why the basket size has changed. If anything, many of those items, it's a lower price point. If we are doing brand only and we brought in the \u2013 prefer [ph] next to it, in many instances, it may be the same because we go to a bigger pack size. In many instances, you've got a lower price point on the same number of units.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.","Mike Montani","Hey, guys. This is Mike Montani on for Greg. Thanks for taking the question. Wanted to ask, first of all, Richard, you mentioned that there was obviously a little bit of extra strength maybe in some of the discretionary versus nondiscretionary categories and that was something that gave you comfort that the consumer hadn't changed that much.","Can you provide any updates -- obviously, early on here, but like from May results so far, have you seen sequential improvement in traffic versus even April trend?","Richard Galanti","Well, we really can't talk to anything about May yet. There's no giant surprises in either direction. But, at the end of the day -- and again, the comfort level -- I think I was -- earlier in the call, I was responding to many calls that I received from both institutional investors and analysts out there about the concern.","And again, when we look back at it, and we reported April sales and we said, okay, what are the reasons why it came down a bit, was a little weaker. What again gave us comfort, one little data point of comfort, was the fact that some of those discretionary categories are actually doing a little better than one would have thought given the total number. And so that's about as much as I would read into that.","Mike Montani","Okay, thank you.","Richard Galanti","We will tell you next Wednesday for May.","Mike Montani","And if I could, just to follow up on gas a little bit, could you provide the price per gallon for the quarter and also the comp gallon trends and if there was any material impact to EPS that I may have missed?","Richard Galanti","The price per gallon was down for the quarter 19.7%, basically $2.59 a year ago and $2.08 this year. And what was the last part?","Mike Montani","Just asking about what was the comp gallon percentage change and then also was there any material EPS impact on this quarter and if you could help us size up exactly what we are up against in next quarter?","Richard Galanti","I think year-to-date we are up in the low single digits in terms of comp gallons. Again, the big comparison was it was a year ago when it was really outsized comp gallons up 7%, 8%. I know in April I think a year ago it was 8% in the US, and so that was part of that impact of why sales, in our view, sales were a little weaker particularly in California in April.","Mike Montani","And just the EPS impact, Richard, I'm sorry, on per gallon\u2026","Richard Galanti","It was within a penny or two, really no change year-over-year. I think it might have been a penny.","Mike Montani","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict of Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","Hey, Richard. Thanks for taking the question. One on gas and another on a different subject. You've been adding 20 to 30 gas stations a year the last several years. I think your penetration is like 70% across the clubs.","How do we see that going forward, is that pace of growth going to continue? Where do you think you can get the penetration of gas stations call it a few years out?","Richard Galanti","Well, in the US -- first of all, every new unit we do where it's possible, we put in a gas station and we are even doing a few in countries like Japan and Australia, which we hadn't done historically.","We relocated a few units in the US. We just moved Hackensack to Teterboro. The Hackensack became I think our 11th, 10th or 12th business center and the new Teterboro one is a big new Costco with a gas station, with better parking and great.","So if we did three or four -- I don't have it in front of me -- but if we did 4 relos this year, my guess at least 3 of them have gas stations and those three don't. But we are starting to max that out.","In the US, we have -- at the end of the quarter, we had 420 gas stations out of 481 warehouses. In Canada, 55 out of 90. I'm guessing in Canada we still have a little bit more room to grow because we started there later.","Again, in the UK, we had none a couple years ago, now we have 4. Japan we have 5. Spain, 50% of them, 1 out of 2, and Australia, 5 out of 8 I believe. And so again it's not like five years ago in terms of just adding a bunch of gas stations, but it still, I think, moves the needle a little bit.","Peter Benedict","Okay. That's helpful. And then can you take a minute and discuss the senior management ranks at Costco? There's been some turnover lately. Doug, I think his last day may be tomorrow I guess, but just talk about what's going on in terms of transition, future transitions and maybe what changes, if any, these new leaders have implemented. I understand it would be only marginal, but just curious your thoughts on all that?","Richard Galanti","Well, look, you talked about shopping frequency staying at 4% for 7 years. People have stayed for 30, including me. So you are having some turnover, of course. Over the last few years, you've had people that are retiring in their early 70s that have worked together starting 55 years ago at FedMart in San Diego.","But I think from a merchandising and operations standpoint, that's been well thought out. Let's face it, the first big concern was what's going to happen when Jim leaves. I think while we were comfortable here internally, I think we've shown and certainly Craig has shown that the transition and the maintaining of the culture has continued without missing a beat.","In merchandising over the last few years, we've took certain carriers like we used to be with non-foods, which is a combination of hardlines and softlines and Dennis Knapp, who was a senior executive over that and has since retired, we promoted two people and have broken out hardlines and softlines.","In operations, we've made several promotions and changes of people again, typically low-tenured people like they've only been here 20 to 25 years that are going from VP to Senior VP levels on -- I think we've got about 16 Senior VPs of Operations in the US geographically.","Now in terms of Doug, Doug, as you know, has been head of US merchandising and certainly involved in a lot of merchandising beyond that as well. Doug is great. He's leaving for -- no negative issues both internally or with himself, and we are all kind of jealous. He's more on the younger side of the senior management team.","Craig has a plan, but he's looking at a few things and over the next few months, we will be announcing how that changes. But we've got good people in place and we don't think that there's an issue at all there.","In Asia, Richard Chang, who goes back to the Price Club days probably 25 plus years ago, ran operations for Taiwan, was promoted as Senior VP over Asia and we've brought some new people in there as well, new people meaning existing Costco people, of course, from the US.","And so I think we feel pretty good about the change. It's sped up because it was at zero. In the last couple of years, it's been a few, a couple and now it's a few and a few more. But I think we are pretty well-positioned for that. I don't see a big change in what we do and how we do it.","Peter Benedict","Okay, great. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul of Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Good morning. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit more around some of the geographic trends that you are seeing and just update us on your thoughts around the trends in California?","Richard Galanti","We pointed out California last month for April because it was -- while US overall again was a little weaker than it had been, it was really California. California is about a third of our US company operations and it's probably a little bit more penetrated gas-wise.","And again, a year ago, we had gallon comps, which not only drives gasoline, but more importantly drives people in the parking lot and 52 or 53 of every 100 come into shop. And so that was where we saw a bit of a distortion, California versus the rest of the US.","I believe there was a -- I don't have the number in front of me -- but to get to a 1, the other US was at a 2 and California was a minus 1, and I'm off by a little bit there, but it is that kind of direction. And so that was a little unusual.","Again, I can't predict what that means for the future, but other than that, there are some markets where -- I think the positive that we see is we've been successful in some of these new medium-size markets.","We had the most new sign-ups I believe in many years in terms of a new market, new medium-size market in Tulsa just a few weeks ago. Through opening day, we had more sign-ups than we've had. Now I'm not talking about Asia; that's a whole different story in terms of sign-up levels.","So again, things look pretty good. I don't know if there's a lot of geographic changes other than the thing we called out on California. I personally believe a lot of that related to some of the gas issues.","Bob Drbul","Got it. I saw that you are doing -- what is it, a pickup truck with GMC in terms of -- and are you getting other vendors that are coming to you to look for marketing opportunities given the success of the business?","Richard Galanti","Well, sure. In the car business, I think last year just in the US, we did just under 0.5 million new cars. We've always done -- when car manufacturers have come out with something new, we could do -- by putting one of those cars in front of our trucks in front of each of our locations and doing some type of extra amount of incentive, we can drive a ridiculously large percentage of those six weeks of sales in that car or truck.","In this case, we've toyed with the idea for several years and talked to all the manufacturers about doing a KS vehicle. A great vehicle with all the bells and whistles and an even better value than you'd get as a Costco member or as a Costco executive member.","So I know we had started and stopped a couple times with a couple different manufacturers. We are pleased with it. We think the manufacture is. The dealers are. And sure there will probably be more in the future, but we will see.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Richard Galanti","We back those with auto products too. We just keep bringing it to a different level. Why don't we take two more questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Hey, good morning, Richard. Just want to clarify a few things, if you don't mind. First, on the new member sign-ups, I think you said up 15%, certainly international store openings has a lot to do with that, but you are also seeing success in the US. If you can maybe just give us a little bit more detail around what's driving that.","Richard Galanti","Well, I don't know what's driving it. We do a pretty good job of getting people in the door, opening in some of these new markets help. It's just been overall strong. If the US is 15% and the whole company is 15%, where was it down? It was up relative to the 15% of course in the end and places like Taiwan and Spain of course was huge, but it's huge on a base of one. And then it was a little lower in Canada where we had very few new openings.","And Mexico same thing. Mexico last year we had a huge opening on a base of about 34 or 35 units, a huge opening, which had outsized numbers, so we are comparing against that with no new openings this year, same thing in Canada. We had a huge opening in a location there a year ago in the quarter versus none.","Paul Trussell","Got it. And then on core merchandise margins, just wanted to make sure the 16 basis point gain you are referring to, that's kind of the true core merchandise margins on the four categories that compares to the 11 basis points. Is that correct? And then also you made a comment earlier in the call regarding AUR. Is your view of total store deflation around 1%?","Richard Galanti","Well, if I look at my LIFO index -- we don't know exactly. If I look at my LIFO index, which is 70% of our inventory, it's a US accounting principle, from the beginning of the year to now, that's about a percentage point, 0.9 of 1%. If I look at the just the total through the US front-end registers, number of items in the basket was up year-over-year 1.4 percentage points, the average basket was up 0.4 percentage points, so a 1.0 percentage point delta there.","That again I think just affirms that roughly 1% deflationary number on average. But it's educated art, not complete science here. And the margins, the 16, is on its own sales, each of those categories, by each of those four categories sales.","Paul Trussell","Great. Thank you and good luck.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Scot Ciccarelli of RBC Capital Markets.","Scot Ciccarelli","Good morning, guys. Scot Ciccarelli. Thanks for getting me at the end here. Richard, can you remind us where you are in the IT modernization investment program, when some of those pressures may start to ease? And secondarily, are there any other investment bubbles we should be mindful of as we think about the next two to three years?","Richard Galanti","IT is the gift that keeps on giving. We started at about 3.5, 4 years ago. As we look at it today, what we thought might take four or so years to do the big chunks of this will take six. As we thought it would cost X, it cost 1.5X to 2X, or whatever it is, which is typical.","Our guess is that it'll still be slightly detrimental in fiscal '17 and actually technically it may be even flat to improved a little in '17, but you've got a 53-week year, so there is a little cheat there.","But generally speaking, flat to up a little in '17, maybe up a little in '18 or flat, maybe down a little. We don't know yet. But we are starting to get to that inflection point and my guess is that inflection point will come sometime towards the end of '17 or into '18.","Keep in mind, these numbers don't assume anything -- this is necessity first and foremost. We believe it will help us in different ways, in many ways, and there will be other things we'll add to it. But the bulk of it, of course, is getting behind us and we will go from there.","Scot Ciccarelli","Okay. And any other incremental expenses that we should be mindful of, like you finish one program and typically there's another one waiting or lurking right behind it?","Richard Galanti","I don't think there's anything big out there that way. We just did the bottom of the scale increase, which is a little unusual, not a big number, but it's $0.06 or so a year. And there's no giant changes coming to healthcare. We still give great health, medical, dental and vision benefits to everybody.","If we increased the sales penetration outside of the US, certain structural expenses help us. Healthcare in the US is easily 20 to 60 basis points as a percent of sale higher than every other country in the world and so just by doing more elsewhere that'll help that number a little bit, same thing with labor costs.","We pay similarly great labor wages relative to whatever in-country norms are, but certainly the numbers in the US and Canada are higher than some of the countries. And so those things will help us a little bit.","Now I don't think -- there's nothing huge going on out there that -- I don't think we have any big shocks to the system.","Scot Ciccarelli","Got you. Thanks a lot, guys.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, guys. We will be around. Have a good day.",""],"6023":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call October  4, 2018  5:00 PM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Michael Lasser - UBS","Josh Kamboj - Morgan Stanley","Chuck Grom - Gordon Haskett","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Karen Short - Barclays","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan","Edward Kelly - Credit Suisse North America","Paul Kearney - Wolfe Research","Jonathan Livers - RBC Capital Markets","Oliver Chen - Cowen and Company","Greg Melich - MoffettNathanson LLC","Matt Fassler - Goldman Sachs & Co","Peter Benedict - Robert W.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to this Q4 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the call over to our host, Mr. Richard Galanti.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Britney, and good afternoon to everyone. I\u2019ll start by stating that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the Company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today\u2019s press release, we reported our operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and the 16 weeks ended September 2nd.","Net income for the quarter came in at $1,043 million or $2.36 per share, a 13.5% increase compared to the $909 million or $2.08 per share in the 17-week fourth quarter last year. If you normalize the number of weeks, it\u2019s about a 20% increase.","In terms of sales. Net sales for the quarter came in at $43.4 billion, a 5% increase over the $41.4 billion last year, again 16 versus 17 weeks. On a comp basis which is on a like-week basis, comps were up 9.5% for the quarter. Sales for the 52-week fiscal year 2018, they increased 9.7% to 138.4 billion from $126.2 billion last year and the 53-week year; on a comp basis for the year as well, we reported a 9.5% comp.","Now, comp sales for the fourth quarter were as follows, and again from the press release. In the U.S. on a reported basis, was 10.8%; ex gas and FX, it would have been a 7.8. Canada, reported was a 5.7% for the 16 weeks; on a ex gas and FX was 4.6%. And other international 6.7% reported, a 6.9% ex gas and inflation -- gas inflation and FX. All told, total Company, as I mentioned, reported a 9.5%, ex gas and FX was 7.2%. As well e-commerce, which we have started reporting about a year ago on a monthly basis as well, e-commerce for the 16 weeks was a 26.2% comp, and ex gas and FX 26.3%.","In terms of Q4 sales metrics. Fourth quarter traffic or shopping frequency was up 4.9%, both on a worldwide basis as well as in the U.S. Weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted sales by about 25 basis points and gas inflation benefited Q4 comps by about 260 basis points. Cannibalization by the way weighed on the comp by about 55 basis points negative. Our average frontend transaction was up 4.4% during Q4; and excluding the impacts of inflation and FX, our average ticket was up a little over 2%.","Next on the income statement line, membership income. We reported $997 million or 2.30% of membership fee income in Q4 of \u201818; last year in the 17-week quarter, it was $943 million, 2 basis points lower. So, about 54 -- on a reported basis, $54 million increase or up 5.7%, again on a like weeks basis up a little over 12%. Of this normalized 12% number increase year-over-year in Q4, a little over half related to membership fee increases, the majority of which came from the $5 and $10 annual fee increases taken last June 1st in the U.S. and Canada.","In terms of membership renewal rates. Renewal rates rose in Q4. In our U.S. and Canada membership renewal rate at Q4-end stood at 90.4%. That\u2019s up from 90.1% at Q3-end 16 weeks earlier; and our worldwide rate improved from 87.9% -- improved to 87.9%, up from 87.5% at Q3-end.","In terms of number of members at Q4-end. At Q4-end, we had 40.7 million Gold Star households that\u2019s up from 16 weeks earlier 40.0 million; primary business 7.6 million, up from 7.5 million; business add-ons stood at 3.3 million, both at Q3-end and Q4-end. So, all told, we went from 50.9 million member households quarter ago end to 51.6 million at Q4-end. In terms of cardholders, we ended the year with 94.3 million cardholders, up from 93.0 million at Q3-end.","During the quarter, we had 13 net new openings. Also at Q4-end, paid executive memberships stood at 19.3 million that\u2019s an increase of 229,000 exec members during the 16 weeks or about 14,000 increase per week, which by the way is the same average for the whole year.","Related to the annual fee increases. The year-over-year quarterly fee income benefit peaked in this quarter, the fourth quarter. It will continue to be added to our numbers during the upcoming fourth quarters, very little in Q4 of \u201819, but during the four quarters, but will moderate each quarter. And this is due to the nature of deferred accounting treatment of the fee increases.","Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin in the fourth quarter was lower year-over-year by 35 basis points, coming in at 10.92%, down from 11.27%.","And that 35 basis-point negative, excluding gas inflation was minus 9 basis points. As I always ask you to do, go down two columns of numbers, one is Q4 \u201818 reported; and then, Q4 \u201818, ex gas inflation. The first line item would be core merchandise. On a year-over-year basis, on a reported basis, core merchandise was margin was down 44 basis points year-over-year, ex-gas inflation was down 22. Ancillary businesses were plus 14 reported and plus 21 ex-gas inflation; 2% reward plus 1 and minus 2 basis points. Other was minus 6 and minus 6 basis points year-over-year. If you add those two columns up, you\u2019ll get the 35 basis-point negative, which we reported and then minus 9 basis-point, which I just mentioned on an ex-gas inflation basis.","Now, the core merchandise component, again on reported basis was lower by 44 and lower by 22 ex-gas inflation; that still takes into account the sales penetration of the different categories. If you look at the core merchandise categories in relation to their own sales, core merchandise margin categories in terms of their own sales core on core, if you will, margins year-over-year in Q4 were lower by 2 basis points. Within the food and sundries and hardlines was up a little, softlines and fresh were down little. But all told, it was minus 2 on core on core.","Ancillary and other business gross margin, as I mentioned, was up 14 reported and up 21, ex-gas inflation. That\u2019s because of the extra good margins as well as the sales penetration. Other was minus 6, as was the case in the first three quarters of fiscal \u201818. I\u2019ve mentioned to you that we\u2019re incurring some incremental costs, primarily related to the rollout of the centralized return facilities throughout the country. And during the quarter, that was a 4 basis-point detriment, which is relatively speaking, an improvement from the first three quarters.","In addition, we\u2019re cycling some one-time items that last year and the quarter -- which net-net benefited last year\u2019s quarter by two basis points with some positive legal settlement offset by some impact from last year\u2019s Hurricane Harvey.","Moving to SG&A. Our SG&A percentage was lower or better by 15 basis points; and on ex-gas inflation and FX, it was worse by 8 basis points, coming in at 9.82 of sales this year; that would be the 15 basis points lower than the 9.97 on a reported basis. Again, for ease of explanation, we\u2019ll jot down two columns of numbers, Q4 \u201818 as reported and then Q4 \u201818, ex-gas inflation.","Core operations is the first one, lower by 16, and I will say plus 16 basis points and minus 4 basis points or worse by 4 basis points on ex-gas inflation basis; central minus 4 and minus 7; stock compensation zero and zero; and other was a benefit, plus 3 and plus 3. Again, you add up the columns, you get on a reported basis, we were lower or better by 15 basis points and ex gas inflation, higher or worse by 8 basis points.","Now, the core operation component, I\u2019d say, the U.S. wage increase that went into effect in June 11th to our hourly employees in the U.S., that negatively impacted SG&A by 6 basis points. And as I mentioned probably last quarter, this will continue to impact the SG&A comparison over the next three quarters, so June 11 through June 10th of next year. ","Central expense was higher year-over-year in Q4 by 4 basis points, 7 ex gas inflation, IT expenses were 2 basis points of that, and the balance coming from a lot of small changes in a variety of miscellaneous items frankly. But, net-net, it added up to minus 7 ex gas. And lastly, other was better by 3; that related to expenses incurred last year on the SG&A line as well from the Hurricane Harvey.","Next, on the income statement, preopening expense. About the same year-over-year. This year, it came in at $31 million; last year, it was $30 million, so $1 million higher. Last year in the quarter, in Q4 we opened 15 openings, 13 net, plus a couple of relos. This year, we had 12 openings, 8 in the U.S. and Canada, and 4 international. All told, reported operating income for the 16-week Q4 of \u201818 came in at $1,446 million; this compares to a $1,450 million in the 17 weeks results of last year in the fourth quarter.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $5 million lower year-over-year, coming at $48 million this in Q4 compared to $53 million last year. Interest income and other for the quarter was higher year-over-year by $29 million. Interest income itself was higher by $11 million, despite one less week year-over-year, a combination of higher interest rates earned on the cash proceeds, cash we have, as well as higher invested cash balances. Also benefitting the year-over-year comparison were positive year-over-year FX items that in total amounted to $14 million.","Overall, pretax income was higher by 2% or $30 million in this year\u2019s 16-week quarter, coming in at $1,449 million this year versus last year\u2019s 17 weeks results of $1,419 million. ","In terms of income taxes. Our tax rate in Q4 \u201818 came in at 27.4% and 28.4% for all of fiscal \u201818. This compared to 27.4% for Q4 compared to last year\u2019s Q4 of 34.3%. This quarter\u2019s tax rate benefitted of course from the income tax reform that was effective January 1st as well as the favorable discrete tax adjustments. For fiscal \u201819, based on our current estimates, which of course are subject to change, we anticipate our effective total Company tax rate to be approximately 28%.","A few other items of note. During -- in all fiscal \u201818, we opened a net of 21 new units, plus additional -- 4 additional relos. Of the 21 net, 13 were in the United States and 8 were international. For \u201819, we expect to open 20 plus, in the low-20s net new warehouses. About 3 quarters will be in United States and about a quarter international. As well, we plan to relocate 4 units to better located and larger facilities, same number as we did this year.","We\u2019re also under construction with our first Costco in China in Shanghai with the opening expected late next September. As of Q4 end, total warehouse square footage stood right at 110 million square feet.","And next subject, stock buybacks. In Q4, we repurchased $89 million worth of Costco stock or 419,000 shares at an average price of $211.35. For all of 2018, we repurchased $322 million at an average price of 183.13 per share.","Moving to e-commerce activities. Overall e-commerce sales increase has continued at strong levels for the quarter, coming in at 26.2% and for the year, 32.2%. First and foremost, we continue to deliver great values for our members as well we continue improving and slightly expanding our offerings, including some new brands and higher end brands. We continue to improve the member experience as well. This past fiscal year, our site traffic conversion rates and orders, all improved year-over-year.","Online grocery, both our dry grocery as well as our -- our dry grocery two-day delivery as well as our same-day fresh delivery, the latter through Instacart and others like Shipt are growing nicely, but still a very small part of our Company\u2019s sales. In terms of online two-day grocery, which is the right side, we\u2019re generating sales in all 50 states including the 6 states where no physical Costcos are present, still relatively small to our Company.","We continue to improve the online merchandise and sales offerings and services offerings with Hot Buys and Buyer Picks, and buy online and pickup in store. And we\u2019ll continue to do exciting merchandising activities. Overall, all these efforts we feel are positively impacting our business, both online and in warehouse and are helping our sales increasing member awareness of our digital presence, as well as increased traffic that we\u2019ve enjoyed in our warehouses.","The next subject I\u2019ll touch on is tariffs and their impact on our business. As you know, there are many moving parts and it\u2019s extremely fluid, starting with the actions and reactions by both the U.S. and Chinese governments. What actions are we exploring and taking in some short term and some long term? Accelerating shipments before tariffs go into effect; recognizing there\u2019s a limited ability to do so, everybody\u2019s trying to. Working with suppliers to see what can be done to reduce and\/or absorb some of the costs. In some cases, reducing our commitments on certain impacted items. Alternative country sourcing, sure, but again, it\u2019s where possible and feasible; it\u2019s limited ability that takes time. Five, taking advantage of lower pricing on some U.S. items because of the reverse, if you will, such as pork, nuts and soybeans.","In summary, we\u2019ll have to see how customers and competitors react to tariffs and what impacts it will have remain to be seen.","Last topic, as was noted in this afternoon\u2019s press release. We plan to report in our Form 10-K a material weakness in internal control related to general IT controls. These controls relate to internal user access and program change management over certain of our IT systems that relate to our financial reporting processes. I can tell you that there have been no misstatements identified in the financial statements as a result of the deficiencies, and we expect to timely file our Form 10-K.","In terms of remediation. Remediation efforts have begun. But material weakness will not be considered remediated until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and we conclude through testing that controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of the material weakness will be completed prior to the end of fiscal 2019.","Lastly, in terms of upcoming releases. We will announce our September sales results for the 5 weeks adding the Sunday, October 7th, next week on October 10th.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Britney for Q&A. Thank you, Britney. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And at this time, we have a question from Michael Lasser.","Q - Michael Lasser","Good evening, Richard. Thanks a lot for taking my question. With the core gross margin down 2 basis points, the expectation was that you\u2019d be taking some of the tax reform and investing it in the value proposition, particularly price. So, have those investments been made? And if they have, has it just been [technical difficulty] in areas? And where do you think your pricing now currently stands with others in the marketplace that have been investing in price?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind, we invest in price as it\u2019s in our DNA. Certainly, over the last few years, there\u2019s been several buckets, if you will, that we\u2019ve talked about, starting with the credit card transition that afforded us some great savings, some of which we used to invest in price, if you will; next was the what\u2019s occurred generally every five or six years, a fee increase in June of \u201817; and then, of course, the tax reform. And all those things I think have afforded us the ability. So, I don\u2019t know -- it\u2019s not like this one thing, but these monies are fungible. And we are not only investing in price, we\u2019re investing in infrastructure that we would have done anyway, remind you, with the initial successes of two-day and one-day fresh. So, there is a lot going on.","And in terms of how we feel competitively, I can tell you, every four weeks when we meet for our daily budget meeting in each of -- the U.S. as an example, each of the -- all regions, including foreign regions, but in the U.S., the eight geographic regions, they do price shops compared to our direct competitors, and we feel very good about those where we stand competitively. As it relates to monies that traditional retailers, whether it\u2019s supermarkets or the other big boxes, look, it works and it helps. But we think it impacts other traditional retailers a lot more than it does to us. I think that we\u2019ve seen as evidenced by our strong traffic numbers and frankly our strong comps in store, we feel pretty good about where we stand on that.","Michael Lasser","You\u2019ve been accelerating your e-commerce growth and it\u2019s growing at a very nice clip. So, would you consider further doubling down on some of your e-commerce investments in light of the fact that you\u2019ve been able to show growth through both channels?","Richard Galanti","Well, doubling down, I guess there\u2019s going be lots of definitions of doubling down. I think, we are; I mean, we certainly are putting a lot of focus on. And I can tell you, within IT, we\u2019ve got a lot of efforts going into fulfillment and sourcing and you name it. But, I think part of our long-term natured DNA is that we\u2019re going to do what we feel comfortable doing and grow it nicely. We\u2019ve got a lot of activities in that area. We\u2019ve added brands; we\u2019ve added some categories. But for us, doubling or tripling 3,000 or 4,000 SKUs to 8,000 or 9,000 is a lot for us. But, there are plenty of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing, not only on adding products but the way we do it. We feel that the one and two-day delivery options that we now offer at frankly better prices and our items were being offered by other third parties before, dramatically better pricing, should help us, should help that process. We\u2019re finding the ability to benefit not only with e-commerce but using online and emails to drive traffic into the warehouse, again with Hot Buys and perhaps in some cases some targeted buys, and online and e-commerce to be able to sell some items that were seasonally in nature that we might only have for 8, 10, 12 weeks, notably, patio furniture and lawn and garden or furniture during the summer. But patio lawn and garden, we generally were in and out of that stuff for 10, 12 weeks. Now, we\u2019re in 52 weeks online and there are some real sales to be had there. So, part of it\u2019s on us to keep that awareness going and improving that awareness. I think we\u2019re doing a better job of it, but we have more to do there.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman.","Josh Kamboj","Hi. This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon Gutman. Thanks for taking our question. Your comps have been very strong for the last few quarters. If you look at the basket that consumers are buying, would you attribute the strength more to capturing a broader set of categories, or are customers trading up within your core consumable categories? And if the former, which new categories are you seeing the most success in?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s really pretty balanced, I think not only for us but other non-food retailers like Walmart, and Target and certainly Best Buy. Electronics has been strong, and there are some higher price points there in general. Apparel has been helpful to us. So, we\u2019ve had some continued strong results for several years now in apparel, both brand and Kirkland Signature. And we keep trying to put another can in that package. So, I think all those things help. But, it\u2019s more -- I\u2019d say, it\u2019s more broad based than specific.","Josh Kamboj","And then, just as a quick follow-up, looking at consumer health through your lens now. Gas prices had leveled off for a while. They\u2019re beginning to rise again. Are you seeing greater sensitivity greater sensitivity in any of those categories?","Richard Galanti","Well, we haven\u2019t yet, but again, every day is a new day. One thing -- we found that when gas prices were going down, some retailers were taking them down as much as they could have, in our view, which is fine with us. We could have gone down a little more, but still were able to make a little. So, that\u2019s helped us and enhanced that value proposition. Generally, when prices go up, same thing, we generally can find where people are more conscious. I know -- I remember, back in the first part of calendar \u201808, when the economy was on fire and gas prices were north of $4 and some were saying it\u2019s going to go to north $5, we saw a big increase in comp gallons. Same thing we\u2019re seeing in the last couple of years; we\u2019ve seen -- we\u2019ve enjoyed a big increase in comp gallons because of that value proposition. It\u2019s hard to say how that impacts our numbers. Our numbers are fortunately pretty good.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom.","Chuck Grom","Richard, just first question is on the ancillary part of the gross profit margin composition that you provided. Just wondering why the ancillary line was up 14 basis points, so it\u2019s a big reversal from the third quarter.","Richard Galanti","Well, the big thing is gas. Gas is now low double digit percent of our total sales on a price point that\u2019s 20-plus-percent higher per gallon than a year ago. And while it\u2019s a low-margin business relative to us, the Company, its margins had improved year-over-year. So, on that penetration, that helped us. E-com helped us a little as well.","Chuck Grom","So, e-com has sort of captured in that line item, okay. And then, the second question is, I know you guys have talked about -- you talked about sort of store targets in the low 30s; now, you\u2019re talking low 20s. Just wondering why that deceleration in number of openings planned for 2019?","Richard Galanti","Well, we have a budget that\u2019s -- it\u2019s between 20 and 25. So, I come in at the low 20s, just to be conservative. We\u2019ve got more on plate. If you look at this year, this coming year, it\u2019s like three quarters one quarter U.S. There\u2019s more in the pipeline now internationally, but that pipeline takes longer to get through; it\u2019s longer pipeline. And so, I think you\u2019ll see that change, best guess, in 2020 and 2021. If I was a betting person, over the next five years beyond \u201819, probably some number in the mid-20s is a likely number, but we\u2019ll have to see; that\u2019s subject to change.","Chuck Grom","Okay. And then, just a last question on e-commerce. What do you think about the impact from consumers buying online? Have you seen any change and how their shopping in store? In other words, are they coming less frequently to the store? And I don\u2019t think you are too concerned about, but if you could just kind of flush out maybe the entire basket for and trends for total household when you blend in the store trips along with the online buying habits.","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, the fact that traffic is actually as strong as it\u2019s ever been, we enjoy like a 4.2 [ph] average compounded annual traffic increase for seven years from \u201809 to \u201815. And I know everybody was concerned -- you guys, everybody was concerned when it got down to the low 3s and we\u2019ve enjoyed it back in the 4s now and 4.95 the last couple of months I believe. And so, it\u2019s hard to say, should have been higher than that if e-commerce. We think it\u2019s been a net additive, but it\u2019s hard to say at this point.","Operator","And next we have a question from John Heinbockel.","John Heinbockel","So, Rich, let me start with the difference between the minus 22 margin ex deflation, and the minus 2 in their own category. So, obviously adverse mix; I think that\u2019s maybe picked up a little bit the last six months. What\u2019s the primary driver of that? Is that mostly the strength in electronics or are there other factors that work?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s not mix, no. Electronics margins are generally where they\u2019ve been; there is not a big issue there. It\u2019s gas. You\u2019ve got a business that\u2019s -- what percentage of gas is our business now, 12%, 13%? 12% of our total Company sales is gas on a much different margin structure.","John Heinbockel","Yes. But, I think, when you pull out the -- so, ex gas deflation, right, I think, margins were down 22, but there were down only 2, right, when looked at in their own categories, but the difference between the two is not mix driven?","Richard Galanti","Well, it may be mix driven somewhat but keep in mind, there is lots of other things that go into margin. There is ancillary businesses that have high margins -- if you think about pharmacy and optical, their gross margin, which is sales minus cost of sales is a higher gross margin than the 40 to 50 we talked about, because it includes special optometrists and pharmacists. So, it\u2019s kind of like what is the price that customer is buying it all in that. And you\u2019ve got other categories that have -- ancillary categories or services that have higher margins. So, all those things go into the mix.","John Heinbockel","But you\u2019re seeing penetration of KS continue to rise, and is it rising same as it had been, faster or slower?","Richard Galanti ","I think it\u2019s been consistently rising, not faster or slower. Keep in mind, there is still new items out there. But, you\u2019ve got a lot of items that start out at 10 and 20, and 30 million. The big items, like toilet paper and water. Yet, we saw a big growth over the last couple of years in water as -- where we brought the price down from $3.49 to $2.99. And just looking down the list of late, the Kirkland Signature 40 cartridge razor blades with a handle, several -- the organic cheeseburger in the food court, fragrances, the KS fragrances, all kinds of beverages.","John Heinbockel","Okay. And then, just separate topic. You obviously were doing some stuff with BOPUS on a limited basis, and I think you wanted to keep it limited. Is it still just applying to those items, right, the notebooks and the bags or is an idea of expanding that?","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019ve talked -- in the past we\u2019ve talked -- we mentioned things like jewelry, some limited electronics items like tablets, small sized items as well as handbags, high-end handbags and things. We have expanded it to some additional electronics items. But, it\u2019s still -- we still want to do it our way. We think that these are areas where we\u2019ve been surprised that many people are buying it, because it\u2019s convenient and then, they are going to come by to shop. Not to suggest these are all incremental [ph] member shops, by no means. But while they are in there, are over half of them are not just picking up the item they\u2019re going into the shop. They frankly shop at a higher -- much higher average than the average shop. So, so far so good, and we will see.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Karen Short.","Karen Short","Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to start with e-commerce for a second. Can you just give us an update on where e-commerce is as a percent of sales? And then, I wanted to see if you could give us a little color on how to think about the growth rate of e-commerce going forward?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m sorry. What\u2019s the last part of the question?","Karen Short","How to think about the growth rate of e-commerce going forward?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, the number is right around 5% of sales, I think a shade under -- I\u2019m sorry, a little over 4%. And, look, we\u2019re going to drive it as much as we can. I think, a few months ago when we went from a string of monthly 30 pluses to 23 or something, people were disappointed a little bit out there. We feel very good about it. I think, we\u2019ve shown the last couple of months, I can\u2019t say anything about September, that will be next week, but we\u2019ve seen the numbers that we feel -- look, we have the benefit of having not focused on a lot for many years and now taking advantage of that in a big way. And I mean, the example of some big ticket seasonal items like home furnishings and furniture one part of the year and adding 40 extra weeks of offerings if you will, offering online now, as well as what we\u2019ve done with white goods and the success there. In three years, we\u2019ve grown from $50 million to $500 million in white good sales, which has been helped of course by the brands willing to sell us good high-end stuff and our ability to sell it.","Karen Short","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just in terms of the tariff commentary that you made. Any way to give some sense of what percent of product is imported from China today and where you can see that going in the next few years?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s really hard to -- no, we don\u2019t want to give out specifics. There have been some of the analysts out there that have done some estimates that are -- seem to be within the range, but it\u2019s fluid. But, the real answer is things can\u2019t change overnight. And what can change is demand for an item, if the price is set to go up 15% or 25%. But, we\u2019ve experienced not dissimilar things. I mean, in Mexico when you got bunch of U.S. sourced goods historically, when the peso to the dollar has changed dramatically from 3 to 8 to 10, and then from 10 to 14 and more recently, the last couple of years from 14 to 18 to 20 range that\u2019ll have a dampening effect on certain products until it has less of a dampening product -- impact. So, it\u2019s really too early to tell.","Karen Short","Okay. And just last question. I guess, can you just give us inflation in 4Q, both cost and at retail, and then expectations, translation, given all the narrative from vendors base, since calling out passing on cost increases?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have that off the top my of head on a cost basis. And this is purely like looking at LIFO indices and not on sales, because some categories have a higher penetration. It\u2019s very small -- it\u2019s slightly inflationary. But I\u2019m talking about capital S in the word slightly.","Karen Short","And then, what are your thoughts generally, because there has been a lot of narrative from the vendors in terms of passing on price increases? Where do you guys kind of stand or what are you seeing on that front?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, our DNA is we want to be the last to raise the price and we want to work with any supplier to figure out how to not do that. But ultimately, you can\u2019t eat all these. But, we feel competitively, we\u2019ll keep doing what we do that we\u2019re usually the last to raise the price and the first to lower. And I think, we have, as a company one advantage is, is that we don\u2019t have to sell every brand alternative, every size alternative, and every SKU alternative on given item. And there are times when I think we -- our buying power is in effect -- the octane of that buying power is more than $138 billion of purchasing power. Because it\u2019s much number of limited items and not only brands competing, but also what we know about many of these items because of our private label nature. So, it affords us I think some opportunities that perhaps make it a little easier for us. But nothing\u2026","Karen Short","Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Horvers.","Christopher Horvers","So, first question is, you mentioned in the release that there have been no misstatements found related to the internal control weakness? What\u2019s-- is that the highness? Is there any risk that there could be a misstatement of the financials in the future or is that more about sort of just fixing the systems and getting the testing done?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind first of all that we feel comfortable and we feel that ultimately our auditors feel comfortable. We would have expressed a level of comfort we did in the press release about the time that there\u2019s no misstatements and there is the timeliness [ph] that will be filed on time including the K. The issues had to do with internal user access, so people within IT or contractors. And when somebody who may have had access to something they should have and sometimes that they -- once they should have had that access relieved, it took a little too long to do so.","So, the controls weren\u2019t in place. We should have done a better job. We went back as far as we could and looked back as far as we could in some systems, for the entire fiscal year, which is what you want to do and some of the newer systems, there was no look back ability for certain things. I can tell you with all the look backs that we have done and then our outside help has done, has found no issues whatsoever in terms of misstatements or breaches. So, that\u2019s what we can tell you. But, we can\u2019t be more positive that until we release the 10-K. And so, I don\u2019t want to belittle it. We should have -- it should have been fixed it, but it\u2019s -- it was internal to us, not external and we\u2019ll go from there.","Christopher Horvers","Can you also talk about sort of the -- like an organic MFI growth number, sort of ex-FX and the 53rd week? It looks like all-in that that number was running a little bit below 5% in the first half of the year, and then in the third quarter sort of picked up over 5%, and then in the fourth quarter nearly 6%. Is that sort of rough math that you\u2019re seeing sort of like a MFI comp accelerating\u2026","Richard Galanti","Well, that is -- that\u2019s pretty good rough math. But keep in mind, one of the issues is the deferred accounting. The U.S. and Canada $5 and $10 fee increases that went into effect June 1st of \u201817, so in effect, I believe that in total, it was $245 million. Well, in the next 12 months, using that number as the example, that\u2019s how much more we have in our checking account. Based on deferred accounting, it takes 23 months to get that into the P&L. And so, part of the increase from Q3 relative -- year-over-year Q3 relative to year-over-year Q4 is you peak in 12-month sense, if you think about it. Somebody who got a $10 increase for the first time, their renewal happen to be in June, that $10 was effectively $0.80 a month for 12 months, right June to May. Somebody who got it 11 months later in May, they paid it for the first time, 11 months after the first person did, that will hit the $0.80 a month for months 12 through 23, rough numbers. So, if you will, in month 12 is when you peak in terms of that -- getting what I\u2019ll call, the full effect of 1\/12 of the 270 million -- 245 million as an example. ","So, I think a little of it probably has to do with that. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that what used to be a 4% increase became a 5% and there is no 6%, some of that increase is related to that. And some of it of course is related to how many openings we have and when the openings are where we open a very successful unit on these side of Seattle and Redmond a year-and-a-half ago with three other units on these sites including Kirkland and Issaquah, we\u2019re headquartered here and one another. We went from 195,000 members or 65 per building on average, maybe we added another 8,000 or 10,000 over the next year. We\u2019ve reduced the average members, but we added net of cannibalization, 120 to $130 million of extra sales in year one and we\u2019ll grow from there. So, when you do that that changes that growth metric a little bit. Similarly, when we opened in Australia or Asia, we\u2019re afforded huge numbers of new signups in the first year with a lower renewal rate. But nonetheless there have been openings where we\u2019ve had 40,000, 50,000 new members with the company average for all warehouses whose average age is probably in the high-teens, if not in low 20s, an average in the low 60s of warehouse -- of 60-plus-thousand members. So, international impacts it. A few of the LivingSocial things that we\u2019ve done once every year, year or two, all those things have backed that number a little bit. ","Christopher Horvers","So, I guess, fighting through all the noise, how would you describe sort of like MFI comp trend over the past 12 months, has it improved?","Richard Galanti","I would say, -- well, if you take out the benefit of the fee increase and you take out the difference of weeks, my guess has been about the same. I\u2019m guessing we picked up a little from some of the Sam\u2019s closings, the 63 Sam\u2019s closings, we opened up a couple of units less than we did a year ago, and I think proportionately a few less international units. I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So, all those things were tweaking a little bit one way or another. I think overall, the fact that our renewal rates have improved and continue to improve, finally after the impact of the transitions of credit cards in the U.S. and Canada makes us feel pretty good about it.","Christopher Horvers","And then, last question, could you give us how many Visa cardholders you have in the U.S. currently and how does that compare to when you entered in with from an AmEx cardholder perspective?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. It continues to grow. I believe that in the U.S., our Visa tenders -- total Visa, not just co-branded card, is just -- is approaching 50%, in the high 40s. And it\u2019s probably 55-45 the Costco co-branded Visa. That could be 60-40. I don\u2019t have that number in front of me. But, it continues to grow. We continue to get signups. And I think when somebody sees some of the things we\u2019ve done with some of those monies, talked earlier about investing in price, when you can buy something like a high-end television, that\u2019s already at great value at Costco and then when it\u2019s on MVM or coupon, it\u2019s another 200 bucks off. And then, on top that if you use your Citi Visa card, not only you get a cash card -- and it\u2019s not on every item, but in terms of promotional things that we\u2019ve done over some of the holidays, it\u2019s really worth. And so, those are kinds of things that we\u2019ve used that for.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly.","Edward Kelly","Rich, I wanted to ask you about complements. I mean, if you could just maybe reflect a little bit on the impressive run that you had. It wasn\u2019t long ago in U.S. the comps had kind of slowed to the low single digits which now seems like a one-off. But, comps now are above historical -- what you think I guess historical norms. Can you just talk about what you think is driving that incremental strength? And then, how should we be thinking about, I don\u2019t know, I guess, what I would call mean reversion and the timing around that and what is the real mean? And is 2016 even relevant to think about?","Richard Galanti","Look, I don\u2019t know, I never went to -- 2016, one, we did a little bit to hurt ourselves when we changed up in the MVMs and greatly reduced the number of promotional days or shopping if you will, and we changed that over a quarter -- over a few months and we got back to where we were. There\u2019s also add-on that the conversion of credit cards where you had a lot of people that were auto renewal on credit card that lost our auto renewal. Any member under the old AmEx program was using it -- a different AmEx card at Costco, whether it was the Delta card or a hotel card, Starwood card, all those things -- some of those became auto renewal. Members opted in to just have auto renewal. Well, when we switched from one card -- one network to another, all those non-cards were bought by the acquirer, all those auto renewals went off. So, I think some of that is tied up into that \u201816 year.","I also think that some of the things we\u2019ve done with Buyers\u2019 Picks and Hot Buys and collecting email addresses, again we\u2019re proud of the fact that we\u2019ve greatly increased the number of email addresses we have. Some who look at it, say, why didn\u2019t you do this all along? We did, and we\u2019re not benefiting from that. So, all those things I think have helped us. And hopefully, the norm will continue for a while. But every day is a new day.","Edward Kelly","And then, just circling back on e-commerce growth. Obviously, you started the year strong. You\u2019d actually mentioned something, Richard, about people being little bit disappointed when it slowed. Did that surprise at all that it slowed the way that it did? And can you talk about how grocery is ramping relative to your expectations, two-day, same-day, and are there any metrics that you can share relative to the basket size, margins et cetera? ","Richard Galanti","Well, in terms of when renewal rates or comp slowed a little bit, remember when our shopping frequency had slowed a little bit after this incredible run from \u201809 to \u201815. I remember, at the end of \u201809, when we achieved I think 3.8 or 4.0 frequency up from historical average like 1.7, I was the first to say and remind people, if it\u2019s a lot lower in \u201810, it\u2019s still a good two-year stack because this is not sustainable. And then, for four years, we enjoyed it. But, I think you look at the things that we\u2019ve done merchandising wise, the added brands we have, the better communications tools that we can communicate with our members, and really that low-hanging fruit that we are benefiting from on top of, as one of my colleagues just said, great merchandise at low prices. I mean, there is a lot of new things that we\u2019ve had going on for ourselves. I think that should continue. We still have a lot of buckets here.","Edward Kelly","I meant on the e-commerce comp, e-commerce growth, and what we\u2019ve seen recently there relatively how we started the year, has that that small slowdown surprised you at all, and how has like two-day\u2026","Richard Galanti","The e-commerce slowed -- well, we say slowdown, went from a low 30s number to a low to mid 20s number. I\u2019ll through the two-year stack back at you. We feel very good about it. We feel very good about what we\u2019re doing. We think we\u2019ve got a lot of new things to come on and to expand it. And we still have a lot of, if you will, funds in the bucket to drive business in that direction as well. And there are brands that are willing to sell us that historically haven\u2019t. So, all those things help. But, I think the biggest thing is we\u2019re focusing on it. But, we\u2019re focusing in our way. We don\u2019t need to go buy a company and we\u2019re finding out that there is a lot of opportunity for us doing some of the things that we want to do.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin.","Paul Kearney","This is Paul Kearney on for Scott. Just a question on growth going forward and also business today. Where do you think you are in terms of wallet share of your current customers? And what\u2019s the biggest opportunity to grow wallet share with customers? And also, if you had to divide going forward where most of your growth is coming from, is it coming from wallet share, is it coming from acquiring new members or continued unit growth in new markets? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Look, frequency is up; average sale is up. We know, there is an example when we did fill that we don\u2019t add a lot of new members, we have a lot of loyal members that are shopping a lot more frequently. We know there our success with both -- when we are asked question what are the big two or three things that impact that help our sales, I think generally speaking, we all generally feel it\u2019s our strength in fresh foods, which continues to grow and improve; it\u2019s our gas stations, which gets you in the parking lot; and the executive membership. And we\u2019re doing a better job of now emailing you. And so, I think all those things have helped. But, as our head of our merchandising would say, it\u2019s great merchandise at low prices, and some of these Buyers\u2019 Picks and Hot Buys have helped as well.","Paul Kearney","Great. Thanks. And one quick follow-up, and maybe it\u2019s too early to tell. But, are you seeing any changes in membership trends for your clubs that are more like heavily using Instacart. So, is Instacart delivery for non-members leading to any uptick in memberships for those clubs? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Instacart and others, third parties like Shipt and others -- and Instacart is the big one. We have good relationships with them. And it\u2019s growing nicely. But, it\u2019s still a pretty small part of our -- we have not discerned any big difference there. When we looked -- and this is anecdotal, not statistically valid, but when we looked at it, you take a group of loyal Costco members and then a group within that group who had like characteristics of average basket to shopping frequency and they\u2019re loyal. And then, you have them -- some of them will start using Instacart, some of them are using to fill in, some of it. They may reduce their annual shops by a few and increase this way several. The key for us though is making sure they still get into Costco occasionally. And so far, we\u2019ve seen a net increase in that but it\u2019s a very strong population and it\u2019s very small size in its entirety at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Scot Ciccarelli.","Jonathan Livers","Hi, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. This is Jonathan Livers on for Scot Ciccarelli. Just a question on e-commerce as well as it continues to be a focus and you\u2019ve made sizable investments there and still putting up pretty impressive growth. Could you tell us what percentage of e-commerce is shipped I guess stores versus shipped by vendors?","Richard Galanti","Very little if -- I mean, 50% is us, but not to the warehouses, just us shipping directly from our e-commerce fulfillment centers. Very little is done at the warehouse.","Jonathan Livers","Okay\u2026 ","Richard Galanti","And by the way, it\u2019s only the business center with our two-day dry.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen.","Oliver Chen","Hi, Richard. Regarding e-commerce, as it becomes a bigger percentage of your total business, what are the main dynamics in terms of the margin impact there? And you have been speaking about this, but what are your main -- how would you prioritize the main drivers to drive the awareness growth of e-com and the kinds of initiatives that you\u2019re pursuing as that seems like a big opportunity?","Richard Galanti","Again, we said before, first and foremost, we wanted to get into the facility. And there is certainly in some categories, like white goods and big ticket -- fiscal [ph] ticket items as well, e-commerce is the way to go in a big way, and we certainly benefitted from that. We don\u2019t see e-commerce taking over our brick and mortar. We\u2019ve also tried to figure out how to do some of the e-commerce or delivery related activities that some members want and then we could provide savings too, but doing it our way. So, I think there is still plenty of low-hanging fruit. And, we don\u2019t want to get comfortable at just shopping at Costco online, unless there is not a Costco within 100 miles.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And Richard from a modeling perspective for CapEx for next year, what are some of the major buckets and how should we think about how that will unfold?","Richard Galanti","Well, first and foremost, it\u2019s warehouses. And to the extent there is few -- more international, couple of more, IT is few-hundred extra. I mean, it\u2019s not extra from the year before but general. We\u2019ve got a chicken plant, which is north of $300 million, a big chunk of that is expended in fiscal \u201819 and we really started spending money. The cheapest money was the acreage; the expensive money is the facility and all the equipment and everything. And the whole fulfillment -- I guess, what\u2019s new would be some things like the chicken plant would be some of the fulfillment activities we have on two-day delivery, and e-commerce, small package e-com where that\u2019ll be a savings frankly to us. But we\u2019re just -- we are doing a lot of those things a lot more manual than we need to do.","Oliver Chen","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Richard Galanti","[Multiple speakers] So, there\u2019s a few extra things. I think, the number would still be in the very high-2s ish, low 3\u2026","Oliver Chen","Okay. And lastly, the multi-vendor-mailer. Are you pretty pleased with the state of it now? Is it in the right place? I know, it\u2019s an important document, and you\u2019ve been thinking about making sure that it\u2019s sufficient with respect to breadth and depth?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think, we\u2019re pleased. Other than a year and a half ago, -- nine months when we changed the number of MVM days in the warehouse which hurt frequency in the warehouse, once we changed that back, the fact that we\u2019ve reduced the number of offerings in an MVM by 20-plus-percent and increased the total value by more than that and by net positive, and it\u2019s definitely working in terms of what we want to get out of it. Remind you also, we\u2019ve taken some of those items -- not every item is that works the same way. Sometimes some items that have been regular to get stale; sometimes we\u2019ve got to shake it up a little bit or change the value proposition; sometimes we take it out of the MVM and do it in the different way with these Hot Buys and Buyers\u2019 Picks. So, I think we\u2019ve in a way added to the arsenal a little bit, and it\u2019s working, but it\u2019s still -- it\u2019ll still evolve some more.","Oliver Chen","And do you believe that tariffs will contribute to risk factors with consumer confidence? Like, what are your thoughts on how that may interplay, because we have such -- we\u2019re in such a great backdrop currently?","Richard Galanti","Look, on an item given basis, when you have an expensive discretionary item, take like a patio set, I\u2019m just using that as an using example. You\u2019re going to have a less demand probably. Is it going to change? I remind you, there\u2019s a few items on the food side that are going the other way, because this -- examples of pork where something like a third of the U.S. pork goes -- is exported to China; that\u2019s changed. Therefore, pork prices are way down, there\u2019s great savings. That\u2019s creating some opportunities. Same thing with nuts; same thing with soybeans, I believe. I\u2019m just giving you some anecdotal examples. So, you\u2019re going to lose some and win some. How it impacts -- I think everybody feels that tariffs -- people smarter than me don\u2019t like them. And so, it\u2019s probably a small bit negative. Certainly, whatever negative it is, we can weather it better than others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks, Richard. I had a couple of questions. One was on gasoline, obviously, grown a lot. But what was the gallon growth from the quarter, and did penny profit actually improve? It sounds like it did. But I just want to see if that\u2019s the case?","Richard Galanti","The gallon increases were in the low-double-digits, 11% or 12%. ","Greg Melich","Got it.","Richard Galanti","Which is huge compared to the U.S. economy. That\u2019s also new gas stations as well. But I think the comp, it\u2019s got to be in the high singles.","Greg Melich","And how many new -- I mean, stations are at most of the clubs that you can have them, right, is there a penetration number you have?","Richard Galanti","Well, new openings are getting up more so than not. And internationally, we\u2019re still adding we can. I think, in the Australia with 10 locations we\u2019ve got 4, maybe 5 with gas; Mexico, we are adding some; Japan, we have a few. U.S. and Canada certainly is more saturated with gas stations. And we would say we\u2019re not going to have one in 117th Street East Drive. But where we can -- generally speaking, where we relocate, we do. A good example in your neck of the woods is where we took the old land, occupied or constrained Hackensack at Costco and moved it to Teterbor, and then turned the Hackensack into business center. Teterbor is I\u2019m guessing here 20,000 square feet larger with all the bells and whistles with the gas station and with a lot better parking, and so, a few here and a few there that way.","Greg Melich","And then, a follow-up on the cobranded card, if I did my math right, sort of upper 20% of the tender now would be on your card in the club. If I remember correctly, the part of the benefit of this is getting people top of wallet and getting them to use it everywhere. Do you have any sort of update on the usage of how much more it\u2019s being used outside of Costco, and therefore, how much more loyal that member is in terms of using the card and then, coming back to the club?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019ll just say, yes, we do. We do have that information. But we\u2019re not\u2026","Greg Melich","Okay. Is it the same -- is it back to where it was with AmEx, I guess is what I would say, or above?","Richard Galanti","I think it\u2019s quite a bit above.","Greg Melich","Quite a bit above. That\u2019s very\u2026","Richard Galanti","It continued to grow. And actually, keep in mind, part of that is the fact that it can be use at more places. So, if we get -- whichever of those cards was your top of wallet, you have more potential to use it today than you did before.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler. ","Matt Fassler","My first question relates to SG&A, kind of couple of moving pieces. First of all, it looks like the wage increase that you discussed probably drove the SG&A higher by a bit less than the percentage points, so not an overwhelming increase. Just trying to benchmark the year-on-year increase when you exclude the factor of the extra week a year ago. I went back and you weren\u2019t terribly granular I think on last year\u2019s call about the expense profile of that extra week. So, as we think about the apples-to-apples increase because clearly the SG&A seems like it\u2019s going to -- might increase at a slightly accelerated rate with the wage increases. How -- was that an average week that you would have had for the extra week a year ago, are there expenses that don\u2019t get carried in for the extra week?","Richard Galanti","There is little, if any, expenses, similar to kind of what people said, virtually nothing. So, the weeks are fully allocated. It\u2019s not like if we took an annual expense and divide it by an extra week or had a free week at the end of the year, we don\u2019t. We do it by the number of days and the year, and so nothing there. What was the other part of the question? There was a response for it.","Matt Fassler","No. I think you got that one.","Richard Galanti","In terms of the wage increases related to the tax reform. At the time we did that, we announced it was going to be somewhere between $110 million to $120 million a year.","Matt Fassler","And so, I guess, partial impact here in Q4 given the June implementation\u2026","Richard Galanti","Right. June 11 -- was about three quarters -- it was 12 -- even though Q4 is normally a 16-week quarter, not a 12-week, it was about 12 of the 16 weeks was this.","Matt Fassler","Secondly. Your inventory increase was a bit higher and it did speak to frontloading some receipts in anticipation of tariffs. Was that a factor, or anything else moving the inventory in that direction?","Richard Galanti","When I look at the list category-wise, electronics year-over-year is higher, by choice. A little of it -- some of it\u2019s volume but a little of it is what you just mentioned. And I think, the last thing is that we currently have increased our inventory levels, particularly in e-commerce and delivery-related items.","Matt Fassler","And then, finally, on renewal rates, you seem to have shaken off some of the cobwebs that emerged I guess in the period after the credit card transition, your U.S. and Canada renewal rate is back to where it was in the third quarter of 2016, so I guess the best in nine quarters or so and even more so for the worldwide rate. Have we sort of shaken the cobwebs off now? And are we -- do you think there\u2019s more room to move higher here or do you think we\u2019re kind of back at that level where we\u2019re likely to plateau?","Richard Galanti","Who knows? I think we feel good about the royalty and what we\u2019re doing to brand royalty, there\u2019s some things that impacted either little up or little down. It depends on rounding next tenth [ph] or not. When we do one of those -- I think we\u2019ve done four of them now in the last four or five years, like the LivingSocial or anything like that; you\u2019ll get an extra 250,000 members in a 10-day period or 12-day period and would by definition have a lower renewal rate in your hands. So, that hurts you a little bit. And that anniversaries a year later and it helps you a little bit. So, there\u2019s lots of little things like that. But, when we look at the underlying, the rates and I look at -- even taking a country like Australia, which is really 10 locations, its renewal rate, it\u2019s still in the 70s, but it\u2019s relatively new. The average age of those locations is, what, four years-ish, maybe. And I look at the last four years, I only know this because I am going there next week, and its renewal rate has consistently improved for the company in each of the last four years, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in other countries. So, I think the bellwethers are of course U.S. and Canada where we\u2019re mature, the average age of these locations are in the 20s, and so far so good.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict.","Peter Benedict","Hey, Richard, a clarification just on the CapEx. I just want to make sure I heard you right. So, CapEx this year, high-2s, maybe low-3s with the incremental increase driven I guess part of it by the chicken plant. Is that the way we should think about it?","Richard Galanti","Yes. Typically, our own internal budgets are $200 million to $300 million above where we come out. I believe this year, we maybe were $100 million above, right at 3 or 3.1, and that includes the beginnings of the chicken plant, so additional things we\u2019re doing with fulfillment. So, I think overall, something in the high 2s or -- I think we\u2019ve graduated from 2.5 to 2.8 range, to 2.8 to 3.1 range.","Peter Benedict","Do you have the fourth quarter CapEx number?","Richard Galanti","Not yet. It will be in the K in a couple of weeks.","Peter Benedict","Okay. On the international openings, you said 75% of the clubs this year are going to be in the U.S. But you said you got a bigger pipeline internationally, they take longer. Is there a timeframe where we should be thinking about when non-U.S. club openings will account for more than half of your openings, is that a couple years down the road?","Richard Galanti","If you had asked me couple of years ago, I would say it\u2019s three years around the road. If you asked me today, it\u2019s probably two to three-year around the road, and I could be wrong by a year further. We do definitely have more in the pipeline. And we have also been surprised by more opportunities in the U.S. that we -- if you go back to 10 plus years ago, some of the cities we\u2019re in today, we would\u2019ve said that we\u2019re not going to go there. There is always -- there is somebody else there already and it\u2019s not that big of a town. But we\u2019re finding success in those examples. So, I think we -- ultimately international -- I don\u2019t know what it is, whether it\u2019s three years or four years from now or two years from now.","Peter Benedict","Okay. Last question just around brands, both yours and others\u2019, which categories beyond white goods are you seeing kind of an incremental step up in your ability to get premium brands? And then what was the private label penetration for 4Q and for the year?","Richard Galanti","It can\u2019t give you the latter number. But in terms of ability to get new brands, apparel continues, cosmetics, some specialty food items but those are fewer and further between, sporting goods to some extent. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania.","Kelly Bania","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, Richard. Wanted to just ask about -- with e-commerce now about 4% of sales, just curious what percent of your members are really engaging online? And I guess in connection with kind of the renewal rates question. As you look at those members that are engaging online, are they renewing at a similar rate or higher rate, just curious how that could influence the renewal rates over time.","Richard Galanti","We don\u2019t disclose how many of our members. It\u2019s increasing dramatically but from a smaller base, because we have tried in the past. As it relates to -- I\u2019m guessing, I know the Executive member is more frequent, more loyal than a Gold Star member. An Executive member with a Citi Visa card comes more often and spends more and is more loyal than that. I would guess that somebody who is using it online, if they come from the warehouse and they are using online in addition to that that\u2019s more loyal than their respective groups of those other things. But, beyond that, when you got somebody that\u2019s just using online, I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. ","Kelly Bania","Okay. And just clarification on the CapEx, I think you mentioned some spend there going towards the two-day delivery program. I guess, what exactly is that for?","Richard Galanti","Well, the two-day delivery is with about seven -- most of that\u2019s e-com fulfillment. There is some additional expenditures in some of the business centers including building a couple of business centers in geographies that will greatly reduce the -- what I will call the outsized UPS fees relative to the current mileage that has to be traveled to give those packages to their customers.","Kelly Bania","Okay, got it. And maybe just one last one on wages. You\u2019ve obviously been making investments. But with the announcement this week from Amazon going to $15, just curious if you see more pressure from that, or broadly speaking, and how you plan to go over the next couple of years?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, we\u2019ve raised our entry level wages to $14 and $14.50 in United States in the past year related to tax reform. We give increases at top of the scale every year. Even though our starting wage is 14 to 14.50, an employee who\u2019s been here over number of years can get up into the equivalent of the low -- the mid-40s to the mid-50s on an hourly basis over time, on top of the great health benefits. So, at the end of the day, we feel very good about where we are. Employees starting today on a full time basis, it takes about five years to get the top of scale. And I think our average U.S. hourly wage is in the mid-22s, 22.5 roughly, which we believe dwarfs any other retail or retail type entity out there on a base scale. And I believe that you\u2019ll see more pressure on it. And by the way, there are some geographies around the country, even before we raised to it 14.50, we were already above that. We started at about a tranche or two above that because of necessities. Parts of the Bay Area would be an example.","Kelly Bania","Thank you. ","Richard Galanti ","One more question.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch. ","Budd Bugatch","Hi, Richard. Thank you for taking the question and thank you for lasting this long on the call. Most of my questions have been answered, but just on e-commerce. Can you give us the e-commerce impact on comps? Do we have that number?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m sorry, the comps?","Budd Bugatch","Yes, e-commerce impact on comps? How many basis points does it impact the comp?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s somewhere in the 70 or 80 basis-point range.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. Thank you. And\u2026","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s north of 50 and it\u2019s not 1. ","Budd Bugatch","Say again.","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s not of 50 basis points and it\u2019s below 100. So, I think it\u2019s mid to high. ","Budd Bugatch","And can you talk a little bit about the demographics of the membership signups by age? What does it look like? Is your average age of members reducing, getting younger, and what about the signup, distribution?","Richard Galanti","Well, we feel very good about the signups. But, by the way whether they are called Gen Xers or Gen Zs or whatever they were called before that, that\u2019s what you generally sign these people up. I think, we\u2019re in the very high-30s or low-40s in terms of younger people signing up, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen. What was the other part of the question?","Budd Bugatch","That was just the impact on the pace?","Richard Galanti","I need to find that out myself. I haven\u2019t seen that since we told people that our average member in the U.S. went from 54 to 52. That was a number years ago.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. And the last on e-commerce. Is there e-commerce activity outside of the U.S., and can you talk about the strength that you might see there?","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019re in U.S., Canada, Mexico, UK, Taiwan and Korea. And over the next year and half, I think we have two other countries planned. And it\u2019s growing nicely in other markets. I frankly -- the U.S. e-com business dwarfs the others. And it\u2019s probably had the biggest benefit other than starting off of a very small base, because of where we had taken and combined in line and online buying together two years ago. And I think that we\u2019ve seen a big benefit from that. We\u2019ll do that elsewhere. But, it works.","Budd Bugatch","Okay. Thank you very much. Good luck on that on the next period.","Richard Galanti","Thank you very much.","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Dawn, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the second quarter and year-to-date operating results for fiscal year 2012 and February sales conference call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, you may begin your conference, sir.","Richard A. Galanti","Thank you, Dawn. Good morning. This morning's press release reviewed our second quarter fiscal year 2012 operating results for the 12 weeks ended February 12 and our February sales results for the 4 weeks ended this past Sunday, February 26. ","As with every conference call, let me start by stating that the discussions we're having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities and Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC. ","To begin with, our 12-week second quarter results, for the quarter, earnings per share came in at $0.90, up 14% from last year's second quarter earnings per share of $0.79. This was on a 10% sales increase and there weren't any big unusual items either in this year's or last year's second quarter earnings. But as we go through our note, you'll note comparison includes not only a 10% overall sales increase, an 8% comp sales increase and normalized 7% comp increase, excluding gas inflation and FX impact. ","The FX impact on our foreign operations year-over-year in Q2, assuming flat year-over-year FX rate, essentially hit us by about $5 million pretax earnings in the second quarter. We had an 8% increase in membership fee income. This included very little impact from the recent announced fee increase, a little less than $1 million. This is due to the nature of deferred accounting, and I'll talk about that in a minute. ","We had a lower year-over-year gross margins as we continue to invest in pricing. We had good SG&A expense improvement and we had a smaller year-over-year LIFO charge, $6 million last year in the quarter versus $2.5 million and we had a favorable year-over-year income tax rate comparison. ","In terms of sales for the second quarter, reported total sales were up 10% and our 12-week reported comparable sales for the year was up 8%. For the quarter, both total sales and comp sales were positively impacted by gas price inflation, offset a little bit by the slight weakening of foreign net currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year. On a comp basis, the 8% U.S. sales increase reported in Q2, excluding gas inflation, would have been 7%. The reported 8% international comp figure, assuming flat year-over-year FX rates, would have been plus 10% and total company comps reported again at 8% for the quarter, excluding both the gas inflation and FX, would have been plus 7% for the company. And this plus 7% quarterly comp sales increase figure, it's the same level of increase achieved in each of the past 3 fiscal quarters, again on a normalized basis, including the effects of gas pricing and FX. ","In terms of sales for the 4-week month of February, it's pretty similar to the quarter. Excluding gas inflation, the 8% reported U.S. comp was 7%; the 8% international comp was plus 9% in local currency and excluding both of those, total company reported comp of 8% would have been a plus 7%. ","Other topics of interest are opening activities. After opening 4 new locations in the Q1, which ended last November 20, one each in Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin and Georgia, we opened 2 new locations in the second quarter, both in Japan, one in Yawata, near Osaka; and one in Zama, near Tokyo. Since Q2 end, on February 12, we opened last week one new location in Kobe, near Osaka, Japan. And also, last week, we reopened our Tamasakai warehouse in Japan. This had been closed since the tragic earthquake last March 11. All told, that would put our fiscal 2012 expected opening schedule at 17 net new units, the 8 we have opened fiscal year-to-date and 9 more to open by fiscal year end. And these 17 consist of 10 in the U.S., 1 in Canada, 2 in Korea and 4 in Japan. With the opening last week, the 2 openings last week, we now operate 600 locations around the world. I'll also touch on costco.com, membership results, additional discussion about margins and SG&A and our recent stock repurchase activities. ","So on to the results. Sales for the quarter were $22.5 billion, up 10% from last year's $20.4 billion. Again on a reported comp basis, Q2 sales were reported at plus 8% and plus 7%, what I\u2019ll call normalized after excluding gas and FX. For the quarter, our 8% reported comp figure was a result of a combination of the average transaction size of plus 2.4% and an average frequency increase of plus 5.2%. The frequency trend during the past 3 months of December, January and February was plus 5%, plus 5.5% and plus 5.3% and, again, for the 12-week quarter it was plus 5.2%. ","We're now going into our fourth calendar year of year-over-year frequency increases over 4%, and that, of course, is after years of frequency increased figures generally in the 0% to plus 2% range. ","For the February reporting month, much like the quarterly comp figures, our plus 8% recorded comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of 2.9%. It's a little higher than the 2.4% for the quarter overall and an average frequency increase of 5.3%. In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, our first for the quarter, in the U.S., the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast regions were the strongest. Overall, U.S. was very similar to the total company. Internationally, in local currencies, we had the same comp percent increase, about 10%, as the 10% in our prior 2 fiscal quarters, both Q4 of last year and Q1 of 2012, what I'll say is in local currencies international comp was also 10%. ","For February, on a U.S. regional basis, our strong results were in the Midwest, Texas and both the Northeast and Southeast. And internationally, for February, again, in local currencies, the plus 9% result for February compared to a plus 9% in January and a plus 11% in December going back a couple of months. ","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter and month, excluding the impact of FX, I'll just talk about February here since we do this monthly. Within Food and Sundries, all subcategories were positive for the month and averaged in the high-single digits. In terms of Hardlines, the comp was in the low-single digits as it has been for the last several months and a couple of quarters. Within Hardlines, the strongest subcategories were hardware and automotive, with electronics just below flat for the month. ","Within the low-double digit Softlines comps, the strongest subcategories were small appliances, domestics and special events. And within Fresh Foods, positive high-single digit comp and all Fresh Foods subcategories were positive. ","Now moving on to the other line items in the income statement, membership fees, $459 million this year or 2.04% compared to $426 million or 2.08% last year in the second quarter. In dollars, that's up $33 million or 8% and as a percent of sales, down 4 basis points. We continue to enjoy strong renewal rates and increasing penetration of our Executive Membership. Our new member sign-ups in Q2 company-wide were up 11% year-over-year, mostly due to the strong international openings this past year and this past 12 months in Asia and Australia. ","In terms of members at Q2 end, Gold Star, 25.9 million, up from 25.5 million at the end of the first quarter. Business primary remained at 6.4 million. Business add-on was 3.7 million, down from 3.8 million. A lot of that again has to do with as add-ons become executive, they go into the other 2 categories. All told, 36.0 million versus 35.7 million at the end of Q1 and including add-on spouse cards 65.7 million total versus 64.9 million at the previous -- the first quarter end, so up about 800,000. At Q2 end on February 12, our paid Executive Memberships were 12.15 million, an increase of a little over 100,000 since Q1 end, and that's about 8,400 a week. ","In terms of membership renewal rates, they continue strong. Our business membership renews and this is U.S. and Canada, which was the bulk of our business for a long time, was up 93.5%, up from 93.3% at the end of Q1; GoldStar 88.4%, up a little bit from 88.2% at the end of Q1; so total 89.4% compared to 89.2% at the end of Q1 end; worldwide, 85.6% at the end of Q2 versus 85.4%, so up a little bit. That number fluctuates a little bit because of the small base in many of these international countries and you're always going to have much lower renewal rates in the first year or 2 of a new warehouse and in a new market many cases. ","As you all know, we recently increased our annual membership fees in both the U.S. and Canada. The annual fee for the GoldStar and Business add-on members are now at $55 in US dollars and Canadian dollars. An annual fee for the Executive Membership in the U.S. and Canada now stands at $110. These increases became effective November 1 for new members and effective January 1 with regard to member renewals, which of course, is the bulk of our membership data. In all, approximately 22 million members will be impacted by this increase over the 12-month period that people renew, approximately half of whom are executive members, so roughly half at the $10 rate and half at the $5 rate. ","In terms of the timing of these increases hitting the income statement, please remember that membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis. So just using the example of one member who paid an extra $10 for an Executive Membership and, let's say they renewed in January, that $10 would be then spread over the next year, in our case, the next 13 4-week periods. And so the full impact or benefit to the membership income line will be over essentially about 23 months, peaking at 12 months out. Of course, the 23rd month will have the last remnant of the renewers that were just notified of their renewal 12 months into this announcement. ","So in terms of -- given the deferred accounting, there was essentially no impact in Q1, as I mentioned last quarter. There's very little impact in Q2, just under $1 million pretax; a small amount in Q3, about $7 million pretax or about $0.01 a share; much more meaningful starting in Q4 and beyond. Q4 of course, is a 17-week fiscal quarter. It's always been a 16-week quarter, but this is a 53-week year and into Q1 and 2 of next year, we'll see that impact be more meaningful. The full impact of these increases, as I mentioned, is 23 months and we'll see that when we see it. ","With regard to Executive Membership, the 2% reward, along with the increase -- the 2% reward associated with the Executive Membership was increased up from $500 per year to $750 based on eligible purchases. That's about a $4 million, $5 million annual impact. A small amount of that was accrued for this quarter to catch up for -- we're going to do it on -- based on whatever the renewal rate is. While it's still very early to see any impact on renewals from the fee increase, as we only have really one month, January, and even in January that's partial data, based on our limited data and in our judgment from the marketing people here, we don't expect any issue.","Going on to the gross margin line, the gross margin year-over-year was down 30 basis points from a 10.83% last year to a 10.53%. Get to do the little matrix here. Four columns. Columns 1 and 2 will be Q1 '12 and column 1 will be the reported figures and then column 2, we take out gas inflation because I think it makes it more meaningful without the impact of gas inflation on these percentages. So reported and without gas would be Q1 '12 and Q1 '12 again. Columns 3 and 4 would be for Q2 both reported and without gas inflation. ","The line items, merchandising core; second line item, Ancillary; third line item, 2% Reward; fourth line item, LIFO; and last line item, total. So going across the core merchandising, we reported in Q1, as we report in Q1, it was down year-over-year 32 basis points, but without gas inflation, down 10 basis points. In Q2, reported down 25; and without gas, down 16; Ancillary, minus 2 and then plus 2; and for the second quarter, minus 5 and minus 4. 2% minus 1 and minus 3; and for Q2 reported minus 2; and Q2 without gas, minus 3; and LIFO, 0 and 0 in the first quarter; and in Q2, reported plus 2 and without gas inflation, plus 2. When you add those line items up in Q1, as you recall, we had reported year-over-year gross margins down 35 basis points; without gas inflation, down 11; for this quarter, the reported down 30 basis points; adjustment for gas inflation would be down 21. As you can see, again, our overall reported gross margin, well, it was down 30. Within that 30, our core was down 25%, but again, our lower gross margin Gas business, and in fact, increasing Sales Penetration, I guess, business as well caused that impact of 9 basis points so that, again the 25, looking at it without gas inflation impact, was minus 16. ","Now while gross margins in our core business, which is Food and Sundries, Hardlines, Softlines and Fresh Foods, were still lower year-over-year in Q2 by 16 basis points, in the quarter Hardlines and Fresh Foods were about flat year-over-year and one a few basis points higher and one a few basis points lower year-over-year. Food and Sundries and Softlines were down year-over-year a little bit more than that, again for an average of that minus 16. ","As we continue to invest -- again we continue to invest in price to strengthen our business long-term and we think it's doing what we want it to do. Ancillary business's gross margin as reported was down 5 basis points year-over-year in Q2 partly due to gasoline inflation and slightly lower year-over-year gas margins in the quarter, as well as quite a bit lower year-over-year gross margins in our food court. This continues to be due to our decision to hold prices on many items even as some commodity costs have increased. You've heard that again and again. That's what we do and we do it not only there, but in a few other areas as well. ","The impact from increasing Executive Membership represented a 2 basis point hit to gross margin, again due to the 2% Rewards featured in the membership, including that small amount of annual expected increase due to the increasing the maximum from $500 to $750. And LIFO benefited us in terms of P&L benefited by $4.5 million, $6 million pretax charge last year compared to $2.5 million this year. ","Moving down to SG&A, our SG&A percentage Q2 over Q2 was lower or better by 29 basis points, coming in at 9.67% this year compared to a 9.96% last year. Again, the matrix, 4 columns, first 2 columns for Q1 with and without gas inflation and the third and fourth columns for Q2, again with and without gas inflation. Reading across, and pluses here mean good, mean lower as a percent of sales, lower SG&A as a percent of sales, core op plus 28 reported in Q1; plus 9 after gas effect taken out; in Q2 plus 25 and plus 18 without gas; central, plus 4 and plus 2; and for Q2, plus 5 and plus 4; equity, minus 6 and minus 7; and for the second quarter, minus 1 and minus 1; and total, again last -- first quarter, we reported year-over-year, 18 basis points improvement or plus 18. Without gas inflation, it was actually minus 4 or lower by 4. I'm sorry there was an adjustment last quarter that I forgot to mention, the 11.83, that Washington State initiative. That was 8 basis points to the negative. So the minus 4 reported without gas inflation in Q1 also had the impact -- that minus 4 is after the impact of the minus 8. ","For Q2, again, we reported 29 basis point improvement year-over-year; and without gas inflation, plus 21. In terms of a little editorial on SG&A, again the operations component of plus 25 was 18 without gas; and so about a 7 or 8 basis-point improvement, 7 basis-point improvement on core operation that, that helped us with, but 18 without gas. ","Our payroll percentage year-over-year benefited the SG&A comparison by more than 11 basis points. Total payroll dollars in our company increased 6.5% in Q2 compared to the 10% total sales increase. As well, increases in health care costs were a little lower than we anticipated. Hopefully that's a trend, but you never know. Central expenses better lower year-over-year in Q2 by 5 basis points, and as you saw, stock compensation expense was about 1 basis point higher. Overall, we consider Q2 a good performance in SG&A, and hopefully, that can continue. ","Moving down the income statement, preopening, $4 million last year in Q2; $6 million this year, so $2 million higher or 1 basis point. In both fiscal quarters, we had 2 openings. The bigger difference has to do with when they open and where they open. Some countries have much higher preopening per unit. And is also based on remodels and other expansion activities. In terms of provision from period assets and closing costs, in both Q2 '11 and in Q2 '12 we had a charge of $2 million. All told, operating income in Q2 was up $48 million from $596 million last year to $644 million this year. ","Below operating income, reported industry expense was about the same year-over-year, with Q2 '12 coming in at 27 compared to 27 a year ago as well. Now these amounts mainly reflect the interest expense on our $2 billion debt offering we completed in February of 2007. As I mentioned last quarter, and probably the quarter before that, that this month -- next month on March 15, in about 2 weeks, we'll pay off $900 million of this debt, the anticipated annual pretax interest savings to Costco, assuming we're paying 5.3% coupon and a small amount of amortized -- amortization of issuance costs of about a 5.4% hit of benefits -- hit to the P&L currently. And we'll be foregoing interest income on our cash in the 20 to 30 basis point range. That's about $46 million pretax per year. For Q3, given that we're doing this effective March 15, we'll get a pretax positive ramp of about $7 million. For Q4, and again it\u2019s 17 weeks, not 16, the pretax positive ramp about $15 million. And again, you could divide that by the number of weeks in Q1 and 2 next year, so it'll be 12 weeks each. ","In terms of interest income and other, it was higher year-over-year by $6 million, $10 million this year in the quarter, $4 million last year. Of that $6 million increase, actual interest income was higher year-over-year by $2 million, a reflection of higher cash balances. However, the biggest component of the $6 million change was interest income and other, and it is [indiscernible] from another was related to the FX impacts on our business. It was much this positive or much bigger in Q1 year-over-year. But as I explained last fiscal quarter, we consider this part of our gains and whether the gains and losses as these contracts are done mostly by our merchants and are offset or in addition to their merchandise margin, which is recorded up in gross margin. ","Overall pretax income was up $54 million or 9.5%. Last year, it was $573 million; this year, pretax income, $627 million. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate was a little lower, 34.2% versus 35.5% last year. Our lower effective tax rate is due to a few discrete Q2 items that -- any number of things, whether it\u2019s state or federal and audits going on and whatever, the sum of which reduced our Q2 taxes. This is about 1\/3 of that\u2019s lower, in our view, a lower tax rate increase versus last year in Q2 and the rest of it mostly related to decreases in foreign tax rates or overall average foreign tax rate. ","Now for a quick rundown of other topics, I'm always asked about depreciation and amortization. For Q2, it was $209 million giving a year-to-date D&A of $414 million. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories. Last year, we reported it was 97%, 87% if you just looked at merchandise payables, not construction and other payables. This year, the reported number was 91%. That compares to 97% a year ago, but again, looking truly at merchandise inventories and payables. This year, the AP ratio was 86%, down just a little bit from 87% a year ago. ","Average inventory per warehouse was up $1.1 million, $10.5 million last year in the quarter, $11.6 million this year. Very little, almost 0 impact from FX, really spread across many, many subcategories. Obviously, this includes the impact of inflation. As I mentioned in Q1, year-over-year, we were up just under $1 million, $900,000, almost $1 million. So pretty much in line with that level of increase. ","That being said, there are no inventory concerns. We feel we did a good job of taking markdowns for the holidays and our inventories are in good shape as well as our midyear, we take fiscal inventories twice a year, midyear and year end. Our midyear physical inventories were our best ever for midyear. And in terms of CapEx, in Q2, we spent $234 million last year. In Q2 '12, we spent a little bit more, $289 million and year-to-date it\u2019s $632 million. We would estimate for the year our CapEx will be in the $1.4 billion range. ","In terms of costco.com, both sales and profits were up over last year in Q2. Our average ticket has come down a little bit, but our site traffic continues strong. It was up a little over 9% in the quarter year-over-year. We are transitioning to a new platform this summer, bet on mid to end summer. The new technology will give us greater visibility in the Internet and we hope will bring users to costco.com via search engines which our much older current system does not allow. And early summer, we'll launch the first app on smartphones and assume both, and over the course of the next few months a couple of those. We will introduce costco.com elsewhere later this calendar year and into next calendar year outside the U.S. and Canada. ","The -- in terms of expansion, I mentioned 17 units this year. Now the 8 remaining that we have or the 8 that will be in Q4, this is down 3 from the previous 11 that I spoke about. These are all delays, they're still happening. They were all scheduled for August. They're now in either October or November so into Q1 of fiscal '13. Adding 17 units to the original base [indiscernible] of 592, that's about 3% unit growth and a little over 3% square footage growth. At Q2 end our square footage stood at 84,998,000 square feet. ","In terms of stock repurchase, during the quarter, we spent $145 million. That's a little lower than Q1 of $173 million. We're generally buyers every day and, to date, since June of '05, we\u2019ve bought back 111 million, a little over 111 million shares at about $56.74 a share for about $6.3 billion total dollars. We currently have, I think, $3.4 billion, roughly just under $3.4 billion of authorization left on our program. As I always mention, supplemental information will be shortly posted on our Investor Relations site, which has some additional information. ","And lastly, our Q3 scheduled earnings call, earnings release date will be Thursday, May 24. That will be for the 12-week third quarter ended May 6. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Dawn for questions and answers. Thank you. Dawn?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deborah Weinswig with Citi.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","As we look out for the rest of fiscal '12 and you start to cycle much easier gross margin compares. How should we think about gross margins for the rest of the year, especially as one of your competitors talking about very aggressive price investments?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I think -- needless to say, I can't give you any guidance since we don't guide -- but clearly, I think our message has been that we continue to invest in price and I think we do it more than talk about it, frankly, and so we'll continue to do that. But that's what we do. And I think the other message that we are trying to convey over the last couple of quarters and will continue to do so is, well, there's certainly a lot of tough competitors out there. This is us, not them, in terms of what we do for a living and we're not -- in our view, while every day, every competitor responds to one another, but overall, we are responding to ourselves here more than anything.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, and then can you talk about anything you're doing in terms of improving productivity on the floor?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I mean it's a never-ending battle. I mean, we constantly are working to speed the front-end line, whether it's redoing the software for credit and debit, pruning out, all the things that all of us do out there. Just last year, I know one focus, and these are all anecdotal, has been in operations. Again, I think this is where Greg has put a lot of effort into, given his operations background, operators that put a focus on overtime hours. You're always going to have overtime hours whether it's because of weather or people didn't come in if they're sick or holidays where you misjudged something, whatever it is, or physical inventories. But that being said, with a focus on it, and I think that's the key word, focus, we saw just in the last couple of quarters a few million dollars just by having fewer actual hours. And so saying those hours, even if they were still worked, those hours worked as regular hours rather than overtime hours. That extra half was a reduction. So those are the types of things we're doing. I think we still get a lot of benefit from, again, what I talked about over the last couple of years, sustainability. Again, it's not all us; it's everybody. It's the vendors. We're all working towards this end, but it's taking grams of resin out of water bottles and packaging into square containers instead of round, and making liquid everything, detergents and the like, more concentrated. All those things are having, I think, real benefits to all of us. I think we do a good job of managing health care and worker's comp and relative to -- in our view, relative to what our third-party providers tell us they're seeing elsewhere. But it's a lot of blocking and tackling and trying to not do things that we're doing that we don't need to be doing. So in the last 3 or 4 years, our active SKU count has come down from 4,100, 4,100-plus down to 3,800, 3,750. That again was our doing a conscious effort to say if the top 200 items out of roughly 4,000 are 35% to 40% of sales, you can imagine what the bottom 200 are. And every time we can take a palette of something out, that doesn't make sense -- I mean, you\u2019re always going to have some slow things because it makes sense for the small business owner, the restaurant owner, whoever it might be. But if every time you could take a palette out and mass quantity -- mass out something, some existing item bigger, you're going to have more productivity. So all those things that we do. I think for those of you who\u2019ve followed us for many years, I feel that we have continued to do little things that have helped us and we\u2019ve all been helped by what's happened in the economy and trying to be more efficient, but there's no one big thing.","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, throughout, I'd say this earning season, we've heard a lot about volume declines. Can you talk about maybe what's happening with the national brands and then maybe also with Kirkland signature?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, the first part of the question I heard the question, but what was the first part you said?","Deborah L. Weinswig - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So we've heard a lot about volume declines throughout the quarter on the HBA [ph] and TPG [ph] side, so could you maybe talk about tapping national brands versus private label?","Richard A. Galanti","Again, sub-department-wise we haven't seen any of that kind of issue in general. I mean, you see the constant pressures on what we call media and 1-Hour Photo, but in terms of -- we see a continued increase in penetration of private label even within existing private label items, recognizing the bigger part of that increase tends, in my view, tends to be we continue to add items. In the last year, 1.5 years, we've continued to add some canned good items, as an example, canned vegetables, canned fruits and the like. We've got that great peanut butter pretzel that I love. So there's a lot of things out there that we're doing but we've not seen any giant change as it relates to the kind of impact we saw in the first half of calendar '09 right after the financial crisis. I think in a given year, we probably see 0.75 of a percent increase in penetration, maybe 0.5, maybe 1. But I remember in that 6 months, we saw 2 to 3 percentage points, just in 6 months. And again, that was again people's focusing on figuring how to save money. I think one of the things that we continue to see in backflow is when we introduce a private label item. It not only drives penetration to that item which generally is a better margin, but also gets the brand to choose and the answer is just to be more competitive because they're losing market share. So it's a win-win for us and our numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Deutsche Bank.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Richard, just on the price investments that you're doing, I'm just curious, are the number of SKUs increasing each month that you're lowering prices on? Or is it the same basket of products each month? And I guess the second follow-up would be, how are you guys measuring the success of those price investments? Are you seeing a big increase in unit velocity when you do the price investments?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, we are not the most formal when it comes to trying to analyze did it work or not. I remember years -- when we had rampant inflation in the middle of '08 and we lowered the price of our chicken. At the end of '08, when we saw comps going towards 0 and I gave examples, I think over a 4-week period, we had about $32 million of actual markdowns on a limited number of highly visible items and one of them was the rotisserie chicken that had gone from $4.99 to $5.99 and we brought it back to $4.99. Well, if you put a dollar divided by 6, by the $5.99, that was very close, in my view, to the margin, the entire margin. So no matter how many more chickens you sold, it didn't help margin; it hurt it. So we're merchants at heart, and we attempt to drive the top line. I'll give you another anecdotal example. Last August or so, in Canada, where historically the soda and hotdog was at CAD $1.99. Well, many years ago the Canadian dollar was about $0.65 on the U.S. dollar. Well, in one fell swoop, Jim said take it down to $1.50. Well, that's just because that's the right thing to do. Clearly, that impacted the bottom line negatively. But I got to tell you, in a country where they've had a good economy and there's a lot of talk about inflation up there, we got national attention of being the only game in town that's lowering the prices on anything. So we saw increases in traffic and certainly increases in food court as well. So that's what we do and we feel good about the quarter in that we're getting our improvement from expense leverage and buying back a little stock and the like. And certainly, the membership fee as that improves in deferred accounting, that helps you. But we feel good about what we do with pricing and we'll continue to do it but we've really shown that when we need a little margin over time, we figure out ways to do it and do it the right way.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just remind me in late 2008, when you did do the price investments, did it last for more than a few quarters or was it longer than that?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, that was more of what I'd call back then the perfect storm. Again, we're heading towards 0 and we wanted to go into Christmas and early January with some -- driving it. And whether that was the reason, comps did turn around a little bit then. This is more that we feel that we're strong. We've got a lot of good things going on. We're always reminded by Jim and now by Craig, let's not get too ahead of ourselves in terms of our success and let\u2019s keep driving that top line. So again, I can't give you guidance it's going to be for another 6 weeks or another 25 weeks or -- but we don't worry about it, honestly, and not because we're cavalier, because we know that we have the ability to continue to drive sales. And if we need a little margin over time, we feel we can get it.","Charles X. Grom - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then just a little surprised only $145 million of buyback in the quarter with the cash balance. I mean I know you got the $900 million tranche coming due in a couple of weeks. But what are the board's thoughts on accelerating the buyback here? Clearly, trying to open up more than 20 to 25 stores a year has been challenging because of delays and your cash position's only going to continue to grow. What are you guys going to -- I mean, what's the priority here?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, the board every quarter talks about it. Needless to say, what we do, they're certainly knowledgeable of and comfortable with. To do with the strength in our stock price and we kind of look at it on a -- periodically update it to kind of [indiscernible] pricing, buying more as the stock goes down and less as it goes up a little bit and then adjust that upward over time as the stock has gone up. There are a number of weeks in the Q, in the quarter, where again, on a given daily basis, we bought a little less. But we feel comfortable, we'll continue to look at it. I don't want to judge what I and the board will consider and do. We recognize that we have a high-quality challenge with cash. You've heard it before, but I still mean it. I am confident that we will continue to increase our expansion, and some of that expansion is going to be more expensive given the international rate of expansion. And over time, all things being equal, I would guess we'd increase it. But again, we're not going to feel pressure to do it this Thursday or next week. But you'll continue to see us buy stock back and the board is supportive of that. That's a vague answer, sorry.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Carroll with UBS.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just drilling down on the pricing investment a little bit more. I know given kind of the 10 basis-point decline in kind of core business, I mean, is that at the rough level that we should think about until things start to anniversary in Q4?","Richard A. Galanti","Again, we can't guide you.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All right. No problem. And then just in terms of the precedents, I guess, from this time last year when gas prices started accelerating meaningfully, I mean, are there any lessons learned from that period that you guys will be putting in place as we see, let's just say, gas prices catch a bit of a tailwind?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I mean, I think the big thing is that our frequency. There's nothing -- it's a very low-margin business and to try to hedge yourself a little but all you're doing is, if you will, maybe smoothing the profitability out. But that there's a cost to that hedge on a low margin business, that's a big cost, so we don't. And so that's going to continue to be volatile. Whenever it's been a big year-over-year impact to earnings, we talk about it. It's a few cents better or worse or $0.05 better or worse. Clearly, I think last year, in the fourth quarter, we had a huge profits in gas and we shared that with you at the time. But when prices rise, we get more action. We're on the news more, people -- there's more frequency, I looked at some statistics recently in U.S. gallon consumption not just Costco but the U.S. consumers gallons consumption, which in good economies, is up a couple of percent, 1% or 2%, had been done 3% or 4% and of late, has been down 5% or 6%, I believe. I have to check that. And we're still up in the mid-single digits. So we're driving people into the parking lot, no pun intended, and a portion of them come in to shop. So we're -- it's just reinforcing that image.","Robert W. Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And then for the gas sales penetration I know you said it was up year-over-year. Do you have that number?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't -- gas sales penetration. I think it wasn't as much as Q1. I think it was up about 1%. I think it was around 8.5% and the low 9%s.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian W. Nagel - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I also had a question regarding the pricing actions you're taking and then the result and impact we've seen on your core gross margins. So we\u2019ve seen it now for, I guess, a few quarters. First question I have is, as you think about the actions you're taking within your clubs, what's driving, so to say, the cadence of those? Are you going product category-by-product category? Or is it a reflection to some extent the underlying input costs in those products where you're deciding to make actions? And then the second question I have along those same lines is, after these actions are taken, how are you priced relative to some of your competitors? We\u2019ve talked a lot about -- other questions asked you about competitive pricing out there, but are you, generally speaking, lowering prices below competitors or are you matching competitors, et cetera?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, first of all, we're always going to match or try to be lower than our competitors. Keep in mind, I don't know if it's half or more of our business are very competitive commodity items, whether it\u2019s milk, cheese and butter or soda pop or Advil or diapers or you name it. Private label helps that impact with us and others as well. I really do mean it. It's kind of like all the merchants are -- going into Christmas as an example. The merchants were directed in every categories, come up with some ideas of where we could get sharper and be exciting out there and -- have hot buys and have hot items at hot selling prices. So that's what we do. When we do price comp, price shops and we do it most importantly, directly with -- Sam's and BJ's are the 2 warehouse club operators. We're not comparing every price. Are the fresh food buyers looking at the ground beef ads and the chicken dryer ads or whatever else? Yes. But we're not comp shopping supermarkets. Because keep in mind our margins are, on average 11% and theirs are in the mid-20s or more in some cases; or the home-improvement retailers in the low to mid-30s. So but when you look at the most direct warehouse club competition where we're across the street from each other or down the road from each other, on key commodity items, which is, I don't know if it's 40% or 60% of our business, call it half, we're all very close. When we look at it on exact items, we're going to be lower. It could be a 0.25%. It could be 1.5%, 2%, but it's small. Where we find the big differences is on those non-commodity or highly competitive items. Where we're selling a better quality item, there's not as much of a price comp, a direct price comparison because it\u2019s not the exact item on a lot of things like domestics and housewares, and that's -- or the quality of some of the home meal replacement items at Costco versus elsewhere. So that's where others we feel can make a little more margin and we can too, but not as much. And again, that's what we do is merchant stuff, and so it really is all over the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adrianne Shapira with Goldman Sachs.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Richard, if I recall, the last time you made some price investments, it was ahead of easing prices. You were the first to lower and it obviously paid off remarkably well with strong share. Is that true this time around as well? Maybe give us a sense of what you're seeing in terms of inflationary pressures potentially easing especially in food?","Richard A. Galanti","Again, the example that I talked about and as you've just mentioned as well is in late calendar '08, the economy crisis, the rampant inflation of mid-calendar '08 towards the -- the fall of calendar '08, there was rising gas prices, rapid inflation, that came to an -- that was coming to an abrupt end. Well, in many instances, our suppliers, who had committed to raw materials, it was going to be 4, 6, 8 weeks out before the underlying prices to us and to other retailers was going to come down. Well, we saw our comps heading towards 0 and again, I think, again we call it the perfect storm. That is completely different. That was a, hopefully, a onetime perfect storm and we acted upon it. I think this has more to do with the fact that we were very strong, we feel. We're driving sales and comps. We're seeing increasing relative levels of profitabilities in some of these other countries. And it's a constant reminder, constant internal reminder again for years and by Jim and now by Craig, let's not be too sure of ourselves. Let's keep doing what we\u2019re -- as long as we're growing the company and growing earnings, we'll do that. As Jim used to say, we still, we think, we deserve to make more and we will.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I understand it's different and that it's not as abrupt. But maybe shed some light in terms of are you seeing any easing of some of the inflation that we saw last year?","Richard A. Galanti","Oh, I'm sorry, yes, we are. As an example, while there's a very minor LIFO charge, I mean, I think using 100.00 as the starting point of the beginning of fiscal year for LIFO indices, I think we're up 11 basis points for the first half of the -- first 24 weeks of the year, so virtually nothing. And that includes gas, which is a chunk of that. So are we seeing some declines? I know as an example, cotton prices have come down from its peak. So we will see some declines going forward. So yes, there's some of that. Clearly, to the extent that we self-inflicted tend to lag when there is inflation -- even if there's less inflation that there's no lag to be lagging on. So did that answer it?","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think the point is that, while we saw sequentially some degradation in core merchandise margins, if we're seeing some easing cost pressures, perhaps going forward, we shouldn't see as negative of a hit on the margins going forward if you're seeing some relief there.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, I'm going to bet on you then.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my next question, as it relates to with gas prices, obviously, that would seem as if, as you mentioned, the frequency in the traffic should continue to at least hold, if not get better. How to think about -- are you starting to see -- how are you addressing the throughput issues? I would imagine some warehouse is given what is just unbelievable traffic trends, what are you doing to kind of accommodate this kind of frequency? I know Jim was very focused on making sure the lines were not too long. What, if anything, is going on to accommodate what's just fantastic traffic?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, there's pretty much 2 things you can do. Other than trying to speed up the register a little bit. You could put more people upfront which we do. The worst thing is, when you have long lines and registers that aren't open, and that's a no-no. Clearly, one of those slides we've shown at conferences that show the number of units that are doing 200 to 250 and 250 to 300 and more than 300, there are more of them. We look for more sites and we've taken a couple of units over in Asia that were in the 300-plus range and have opened sites. That impacts cannibalization, but that's what we have to do, and we'll continue to do that. So we recognize that's a high quality problem and we have to continue to address it. And again, those 3 things you can add more people, you can improve technology little bit -- that's an ongoing iterative thing, but not a lot, other than when you can just push the basket through the archway and it tells you what you owe -- and then open more units. We're also remodeling and expanding. I mean this is anecdotal, but an example is we're under construction in Maui. We're adding a significant amount of parking. I forget how many square feet we're adding to the physical building itself, and we're adding a gas station. But most importantly, we're adding parking. If any of you have been over there, it's approaching 300 million and it's mind-boggling how small the parking lot and the building is.","Adrianne Shapira - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just my last question as it relates to online, you talked a little bit, maybe give us a sense of where is that business in terms of sales profitability, how pleased you are with it. And you talked about some tweaks and some changes coming in this year, as well as sort of expansion overseas. Maybe kind of give us a sense of what we should expect online and what sort of trajectory you'd be pleased with as that channel continues to grow.","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, well, look, as you know, we are a little different than others. We have few items on it, more big ticket items. We cater mostly to our members. It's a product extension of what we do. We don't have 100,000 or a million items on there. I think the re-platforming is a no-brainer from the standpoint that I think I said it last call, you go online and punch in [indiscernible] or something, and you don't get costco.com and because our platform is an old platform that doesn't allow search engines to crawl on it. Well, that\u2019s a duh. And that'll happen at the end of the summer. And then it takes several months for the hits to improve your pole position, if you will. Beyond that, we found success in, again, big-ticket items, white glove items, whether it's furniture or I like big-ticket electronics, and it's a lower gross margin business and a higher pretax as a percent of sales business. And so it feels small relative to our company. And for a company that's going to do $95-plus billion this year, it's 2.5-ish so it's small. And does it drive us crazy when others do a lot of business? Yes, but we recognize we do some things that they can't do and they do things that we're not going to do. So we want to do better, and we will, and we're growing, but we can always do better on it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on that last question, Richard, when you talked about dot.com, is that dynamic of lower gross margin, higher pretax profit, is that entirely because of mix or does it have to do with the business itself?","Richard A. Galanti","Say that again, Greg, I'm sorry.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That dynamic on dot.com that you described, lower gross margin rate, higher pretax profitability? Is that entirely driven by mix or is it something with the actual business?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, it's certainly bigger ticket items help but I think -- I would guess and I'm just shooting from the hip here, the biggest thing is lower operating cost. A high percentage of the items, I don't know if it's 70 or 80 today or more, is factory direct shipped, and so the cost is the electronics, is running the physical system and the buyers and not a hell of a lot more.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, great. And then you mentioned inventory up $1 million for Club globally, FX not an impact, but inflation was key there. Could you help us quantify that a little bit more? Was inflation all of it, half of it?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, well, on a year-over-year basis, my guess is inflation was 2 to 3, probably closer to 3. I don't have the exact number. And -- yes, 2.5, so call it 2.5, so that was rough number on $10 million, $250,000. The rest of it is, I know we tend to have more electronics right now, but a little bit. I mean, it really was across the board. Historically, it was in 1 or 2 categories, but I think it's partly driving the business.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And is that -- it sounds like with fewer SKUs, but then inflation being $250,000, it means there's $750,000 of actual more depth in the SKUs you have.","Richard A. Galanti","More depth and higher tickets. Not just because of inflation.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay, great. And then, lastly, on gasoline, could you highlight a little bit the -- I think you mentioned gas profitability in the Ancillary, I imagine that\u2019s because of the rate of increase and the replenishment of your inventory? Could you just give maybe a little more color on that? But that dynamic, was that what hit you in this quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","In the Ancillary, that hit us. The food court I mentioned, I think, that's a big chunk of it as well and that's, again, that's I think I talked about that in a couple of the last 3 or 4 quarters. And again, that is clearly us. I mean we've held the price of pizza when cheese prices skyrocketed and again it's still profitable, needless to say, but it's at a lower level of profitability.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But that negative 4 bps to gross margin, you mentioned the food court, but the part that's gas margin, I imagine that's not -- that's not just the fact that gas mix went up. That's the actual top [indiscernible] profit of gas?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes.","Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just given the cadence of what we're seeing, there's no reason to think that, that would change. In fact, could it get worse here before it gets better?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, first of all, with gas, who knows what happens? It was just a few days ago that everybody was talking about gas. There was speculators and there's no reason it should be going up so much, but then, in the same breath, everybody's saying that summer gas prices rise starting Memorial Day. And so when gas prices rise, our profitability lessens. There are weeks when we lose money in gas. And that being said, I mentioned I think last summer is when we made a lot of money, and I imagine prices were going down at the time. So it's hard to say. That's why we try to point out gas because it is such a volatile thing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So, Richard, continuing the long tread on gross margin, maybe going at it in another way. When we last met, you talked about how the first membership fee years ago, Jim basically said to all the merchants, hey we have an extra $20 million in price investment that we can create. So as you think about going forward and the fact that MFI growth really accelerates in the back half as you talked about, do you think that, that will allow you to accelerate the price investment?","Richard A. Galanti","Maybe yes, maybe no. We, as always, looked at it, again -- and I think the example you're talking about is probably something from 20 years ago literally. There's lots of reasons we are competitive on pricing. There's direct competition, private label, given competition geographically in a given state or country, our level of strong profitability I mean and -- is the success of our membership fee income a factor in how we operate our business? Yes, but by no means any different than all the other factors. Some are bigger than others and sometimes they're not. Again, I can't give you any direction. Our goal is not to drive you guys crazy with what we do. It's to drive our business in the right direction.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. And then is there any -- how much of the price investment maybe relates to what's going on in Canada? It seems like there's a war brewing with Wal-Mart accelerating and Target launching next year?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, again, I'm not going to comment specifically. What we do everywhere in the world as we enter a new state in the United States as somebody comes into one of our markets, we're more competitive. We respond -- usually, our most direct response and impact of that direct response is when it's direct warehouse club-to-warehouse club. And certainly, as Target, which is a new entrant into the Canadian retail market, and Wal-Mart, a very strong retailer up there as well, and other Canadian retailers, there's going to be a lot of pricing competition and advertising and certainly, we're going to continue to drive our business. So again, that's what we do -- that's one of the things we do but we do those things elsewhere as well.","Christopher Horvers - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Understood. And final question on the weather, our other favorite topic. So it seems like there's some speculation out there whether or not this is core consumer getting better or maybe January and February is seeing a lift out of weather. Is there anything you can say to that topic or anything you're seeing on the category level that you think is instructive?","Richard A. Galanti","Bob was whispering that this year was a little better than last year weather-wise but not a big impact, in our view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Morgan Stanley.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Richard, it's Mark Wiltamuth. I wanted to get your thoughts on foreign exchange drag that we could see in the second half of the year at this point.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, yes, who knows? I mean it depends on what's going on. I was looking back at the last several quarters. For a long time, the dollar weakened and then it strengthened dramatically and then it's coming off of that strength. Right now it's slightly negative. There's nothing giant brewing out there. The euro thing is less of an impact but who knows? I don\u2019t know.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then looking back through the holiday period, you were clearly one of the holiday winners in terms of sales trend. If you look at those margin investments you did make, were those all planned investments? Or did you have any of that holiday promotion that was kind of reactionary?","Richard A. Galanti","I don't think anything we did was reactionary. It was all done in advance. I mean there may be 1 or 2 things, but I don't even remember thinking, hearing about that.","Mark Wiltamuth - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then as you look at how things are going on expenses right now, what level of comps do you think you need to lever SG&A in the back half of the year?","Richard A. Galanti","You know, for the last several years, we've tried not to predict because we realize we don't know. I think whatever x is, it's a little bit lower sales comp number than it used to be because we, like everybody, has gotten a little more efficient in the last few years with the economy. I hesitate to know what it would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Richard, just a couple of quick questions. I just want to follow up on your answer to Greg Melich's question where you said higher tickets but not just because of inflation. And I was wondering if you could just give us a little more insight to the type of category shifts that you've been seeing recently and what maybe you expect for this year that could be different from what you've seen in the last couple of years? Are you adding higher ticket items to the assortment broadly? Or is it on the Softlines category? Or maybe just a little help helping us see what you may be feeling. We won't hold you to it, but any changes you're seeing?","Richard A. Galanti","Look, it\u2019s all over the board. I mean jewelry is up, needless to say, because of inflation. The average price point of a TV is up a little bit versus being down typically year-over-year. Cameras are up a little bit. Both of those have to do with the earthquake in Japan and the floods in Thailand I think in regard to cameras and hard drives or whatever. So some of those things haven't been deflationary. I noticed, again, I'm telling you this as a shopper. Some of the private label items we've had, canned goods, are 8 packs, not 6 packs. Those are things we do out there. And I know we have a few more home meal replacement items. So I think it's really all over the board. I would think some of it also is more physical units out there, because it can't all be [indiscernible]. But again, our inventories are clean and our shrink numbers midyear were great.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just one other question, on the online, are you guys contemplating a change in how you charge for shipping related to this redo?","Richard A. Galanti","I'll tell you soon as I know. I don't know what plans that I have or haven't heard about yet. We keep doing what we do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Richard, first thing, just a data point, do you have the square footage at the end of the quarter?","Richard A. Galanti","Yes, it is 84,998,000.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Alright. I want to poke around in another category, apparel. How did that behave during the quarter and any comments on what you might be doing there?","Richard A. Galanti","Apparel was up in the mid- to mid-high single digits and we get brands and we continue to try to divert brands that won't sell us, but no, it's been relatively decent.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And then on the electronics category, you mentioned before on the comp commentary was, I think you said just below 0, but you had some dollar increases in TVs, so how are units tracking overall in electronics?","Richard A. Galanti","Well, needless to say, it's a little bit below \u201cbelow 0.\u201d But I don't have that in front of me. My guess it's in the low to mid. It's not dramatically different than that.","Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","When you're looking at the cash the company has, you\u2019re going to pay down a chunk of debt. How about the dividend? What's the board\u2019s or management's thought on boosting the dividend meaningfully?","Richard A. Galanti","Again, we talk about it. There's a formal discussion every year in our April board meeting and but there's no -- again, I can't give any direction of what we discuss until we announce it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the club opening delays you're seeing, that was also down from the prior plan, but trying to think of many comparable situations for companies that have such strong consumer demand, high comps, great return on capital. I mean is it your fate at this point to be driving around 3% footage growth due to the size? Or are there any changes you can make to reaccelerate unit openings, expanding the real estate team or changes in property siting?","Richard A. Galanti","We have expanded the real estate team in the last year or so, including putting people on the ground in a few of these other countries, more so than we had in the past. We clearly are focused more internationally, which has a little longer time line. There is a lot in the pipeline. Craig clearly is committed to that and I hope we can all sit here soon and say, okay, it finally happened. One of the things that I've said before as we reflect on this question is that one of our -- in our view, one of our strengths, in some people's view relative to how quickly we open units, people think it's a shortcoming -- is we're very hands-on. And we, particularly in -- I kind of viewed it as a real positive in terms of rapid rate of expansion for years between the 3 countries and Japan, 3 in Taiwan. Between the 3 countries, we had about 20 units, so 6 or 7, 5 to 8 per country. And between those 3 units, we may open 1 or 2 a year in total between those 3 countries. That was 6 in the last year, I think, and it'll be more going forward. So we've got more in the plate and I think you should see that turn somewhat at least directionally upward. But I'm tired of listening to me also.","Mark R. Miller - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the pipeline, and that sounds encouraging, is that -- I mean is there I guess a figure you could share with us in terms of sites that have been approved or, I guess, some way for us to look at '13 and whether that number can push higher?","Richard A. Galanti","At the end of the day, I would assume, and I'm sure you [indiscernible], the number should be in the mid-20s, which would give me more comfort that at least it'll be in the low 20s but we\u2019ll have to see. We\u2019ve got a lot going on, a lot more -- we have more going on now than we had a year ago or 2 years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Richard, a couple of things. When you look -- I mean, obviously, your customer's very loyal. But when you looked at loyalty, is the Fresh Foods customer and\/or the Kirkland customer, when you look at those 2, are they significantly more loyal than people that don't put as much Fresh Food or Kirkland in their basket? Have you looked at that?","Richard A. Galanti","I have not, so I'm happy to, but I have not.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Secondly, with respect to real estate, is there more -- the sites you're looking at, because there's less -- there seems to be fewer people looking to grow as there had been, the quality of sites that you would look at, is that now opening up a bit or not? That's still not where you'd like it to be in terms of availability.","Richard A. Galanti","It's certainly up a bit from pre-financial crisis, but while there's some slowing, there are still people growing out there. And the other impact aspect of that particularly in, let's say the U.S. and Canada where we are, locations are more pinpoint shots rather than live blasts at geographic area, and anything within a 5-mile radius. We\u2019re looking within this mile radius because it's between 2 locations, 6 to 8 miles in each direction. So that becomes a little more challenging. But that's why there's more effort being put into it. And yes, the answer is yes, the economy has helped that process, but it's not like gone from difficult to easy.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And do we ever get to a point where you think about playing around with the size of the box to open up the potential number of locations, a lot smaller or...","Richard A. Galanti","Not yet. Years ago, it was probably 15-plus, 15 or 17 years ago, in the Northwest, we opened 4 units: the coast, Astoria, Oregon; Juneau, Alaska; Kamloops, British Columbia; and one more, I can't remember which one. And they were 72,000-foot units. And over time, we've changed 3 of them into 140,000-, 145,000-foot units and they're doing quite well. And so again, our focus is keeping it focused on what we do.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","All right. And then finally, so are health care costs now into the single digits in terms of growth or not yet?","Richard A. Galanti","I think they actually were in Q2. I don't have the sheet in front of me, but as I -- given the total sales increase was 10 and we increased -- we had a basis -- a few basis points improvement, the answer is most likely yes.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","And that's not -- you haven't done anything differently with the plan? And I'm not talking about being less generous. I'm talking about just sort of being more diligent about how that money gets spent. Has that been the case or it's just more -- it's going to happen more naturally?","Richard A. Galanti","It's mostly more naturally. We haven't done anything to plan in terms of detriment-ing, improving the bottom line of the cost of it by casting something on to the employee. We have not done that. I think that we're always doing -- in the last several years, we focused a lot more on preventative stuff, needless to say, and getting people back to work and workers' comp. But beyond that, there's nothing to speak of. I know our, what we call high-cost claims, which are $100,000 and over, are down a little bit in terms of frequency.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities, LLC, Research Division","Then just lastly, wage growth in comparable stores that hasn't changed much during the last couple of quarters, has it? And I'm sort of thinking about within that 6.5% growth, wherever wages were growing [indiscernible], whatever, 3% to 3.5%, that hasn't changed.","Richard A. Galanti","I don't think it was. To the extent that we're opening more units overseas, some of those countries have a lower effective wage than the U.S. does, but still very well compensated relative to that country's regular retail rates. So that slight change there probably helps you a little bit.","Operator","And at your request, Mr. Galanti, there are no further questions. I'll turn the floor back over to you for any closing remarks.","Richard A. Galanti","Well, thank you very much. Bob and Jeff and I are here and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Erica, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Erica. Good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter fiscal 2015 operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 23rd.","I\u2019ll start by stating that the discussions we are having include -- will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, our first quarter operating results for the quarter as you saw we -- our reported earnings came in at a $1.12 a share, up 17%, or $0.16 per share over last year's first quarter earnings of $0.96 a share.","Few items of note, in terms of looking at the comparison, within gross margin which was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 22 basis points, we benefited from strong margins in our gasoline business, which I will speak to more when I discuss our gross margins results and we also had a $17 million pretax nonrecurring loss recovery. This latter $17 million amount represented about 6 basis points in margin improvement or about $0.03 to our per share earnings.","Interest income and other, you note was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $17 million pretax or about $0.03 a share. This increase primarily related to several of our foreign operations using FX contracts to lock in U.S. dollar denominated merchandise payables. Under GAAP, the mark-to-market gains or losses, in this case, of course, gains are recorded on the interest income and other income statement line.","I really look at this is part of merchandising gross margin in the sense that our foreign operations -- our foreign operations buyers lock in exchange rates at prices -- at amount which they are comfortable they will be able to price their merchandise at.","Third, FX, in the first quarter, as you probably are aware, the foreign currencies where we operate overall weakened versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in the first quarter, when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $22 million pretax or $0.03 a share than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year.","Fourth item, stock expense, that was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $38 million or $0.06 a share. As I mentioned before, we have over 4,000 of our assistant managers and above, who receive restricted stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation.","These grants are made annually each October or in the first fiscal quarter. These RSU grants then typically vest over a five-year period, with accelerated vesting when a recipient reaches 25, 30, and 35 years of employment with the company.","Factors driving this increase included, of course, the appreciation of our stock price, additional levels of accelerated vesting given some employees\u2019 long tenure with the company and large number of employees in the plan. I should note that last past October, our RSU grants were reduced by an average of 15%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient.","Fifth, IT modernization costs, as discussed in each of the past eight or so fiscal quarter\u2019s earnings calls. Our major IT modernization efforts continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through \u201815 and into probably the first half of \u201916, especially as these new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins.","In the first quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs -- these incremental costs impacted SG&A by $12 million on estimated 3 basis points or $0.02 a share.","Turning to our first quarter sales, in terms of the sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figures for Q1 showed a 5% increase on a reported basis, 6% in the U.S. and 1% internationally.","As indicated in our release, excluding gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 6% U.S. would have been 7%, the 1% international would also have been 7% and therefore, the 5% for the total company reported on a normalized basis would have been 7%.","And as reported last, Thursday, our November sales results for the four-week month ended November 30th, our comp sales increase, excluding again the impact of FX and gas were even a big stronger than these 12 weeks figures, with total company comps on that normalized basis increase of 8%, which included a 9% in the U.S. and 7% international ex gas and FX.","Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans, we opened eight new locations during the first quarter, which ended November 23rd, six in the U.S., our seventh location in Australia and our second location in Leone, Mexico. During the first quarter, we also relocated one location in Wayne, New Jersey to an expanded location.","Also during the quarter we -- about six weeks prior we had experienced a severe hurricane in -- around our Campos and Lucas, Mexico location that has since been reopened.","We have no openings plan for Q2, for all of fiscal \u201915 however, we have a current plan of 31 new locations, 18 of which will be in the U.S., three each in Japan and Mexico, two each in Australia and Korea, and one each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan.","Also this morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margins and SG&A in the quarter, and just few other topics of interest.","Now on to the discussion of our quarterly results, again sales, total sales were up 7.4% to $26.3 million. Again, on a comp basis, reported a 5, ex gas and FX it would have been a 7.","For the quarter, our reported [five] [ph] comp was a combination of an average transaction size of just over flat for the quarter, ex gas and FX it would have been up about 2.5% and average frequency increase of about 4.5% in the quarter.","In terms of comparisons by geographic region, geographically for the quarter, at the Midwest and Southeast were the strongest with Northeast close behind. Internationally in local currencies, the better performing countries were Canada, Taiwan and Mexico.","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter within food and sundries which was up in the mid-single digits. Candy, deli and spirits were up with the relative standouts.","Within hardlines, there were also up in the mid-single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics, came in positive for quarter actually in the high-single digits range. In addition, better performing departments within hardlines was a hardware, sporting goods and tires.","Within mid single-digit softlines, domestic, apparel and home furnishings were the standouts and fresh foods, where our comps were in the high singles, with meat department being the standout there.","Moving to line items in the income statement, the first quarter, membership fees, were up 6% or $33 million to $582 million. That was about -- even the sales strength that was about 3 basis points decline. Again, ex-FX at 6% dollar increase, if assuming flat year-over-year FX would have been up 8%.","In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong signups at existing and new warehouses, continued increase in penetration of the executive member and strong renewal rates both in the U.S. and Canada, as well as worldwide in newer markets.","Our new membership signups in Q1 year-over-year companywide were up 4% year-over-year in the quarter. You know, there were fewer locations opened. We opened nine locations in Q1 this year versus 13 last year. But that, of course, includes all member signups, new member signups throughout the company.","In terms of new number of members at Q1 end, we began the fiscal year or ended last fiscal year with 31.6 million Gold Star members. We now had this quarter end 32.1 million, so up about 0.5 million.","Primary business remained at 6.9 million, Add On Business remains at 3.5. So all told, we went from 42 million member households to 42.5 million and including additional card -- cardholders went from 76.4 million in fiscal year end to 77.5 million at the end of the first quarter.","Also at Q1 end, paid executive memberships totaled 15.2 million, which was an increase during the 12 weeks of about 420,000 or about 35,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive members as you know represent more than a third of our membership base and over two thirds of our sales operation.","In terms of renewal rates, they continued to be strong. At the end of the fourth quarter business memberships renewed at 94.4 at Q1 \u201915, so 12 weeks later 94.5 up a tick, Gold Star remained at 89.8, total 90.6 at fiscal year end and 90.7 at Q1 end and when I say total, that\u2019s U.S. and Canada, recognizing newer markets start out lower rates and build over the first several years.","Worldwide we remained at 87.3% in the fourth quarter and at Q1 end still a nice increase from year earlier at the end of the first quarter last year at 87.3 that we ended the quarter with now was 86.5 worldwide.","As I touched on last quarter\u2019s conference call, we continue to try new things to drive sales and members, membership signups. I did mentioned in this fiscal quarter, but I -- on the last call in early September for eight days we ran a nationwide promotion for new members on LivingSocial. It was a good value and we felt worked pretty well, but we will continue to look and see what we want to do going forward, no plans at this point.","Going on to the gross margin line, gross margins as you saw were quite strong up 22 basis points to 11.03%. Again, I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers, well, our four columns, the first two columns are for the entire fiscal year \u201914, both reported and without gas deflation and then first quarter \u201815 would be columns three and four reported and without gas deflation.","Moving across those lines -- those columns, core merchandise for the year was up 6 basis points on a reported basis and up 3 ex gas deflation. For the quarter, it was down 6 basis points and down 13 without gas deflation.","Ancillary, plus 6 and plus 6 in columns one and two for all of last fiscal year. In Q1 \u201815 reported plus 22 and without gas deflation plus 20. 2% reward, minus 1s across the four columns.","LIFO year-over-year and for the -- for all of last fiscal year was a minus 5 and a minus 5, we actually had a very small LIFO credit this year versus a very small LIFO charge last year in the quarter, so it\u2019s a plus 1 and a plus 1.","Lastly, other adjustments, minus 2 and minus 2 in all of fiscal \u201814 and plus 6 and plus 7 without gas deflation for Q1, that's that one-time, that nonrecurring lawsuit recovery as I mentioned earlier. So total reported was up 22 and for the quarter and up 14 without gas deflation.","Now the core merchandise I mentioned is, on a reported basis was down 6 and down 13 ex gas, a lot of that again is driven by this -- particular the success in the gas business both in volume, as well as margin contribution, where gas margins were up when gas prices will go down typically.","Core gross margins as a percent of their own sales were slightly negative, a couple basis points down year-over-year, with food and sundries and softlines -- and softlines showing year-over-year improvement, and hardlines and fresh foods gross margins being lower year-over-year in the quarter, pretty much as what we planned -- what we continue to see in the fresh foods area with some of the raw material costs going up.","Ancillary and other business gross margins, as I mentioned, was up 22 or up 20 without gas deflation. With the exception of pharm -- slightly lower -- lower year-over-year pharmacy margins, most of the other ancillary businesses starting with gasoline, of course, but optical, hearing aid, travel business centers all showed higher margins year-over-year in the quarter.","2% reward, again increasing penetration represented a basis point hit to margin and as I mentioned, LIFO was a 1 basis point swing, we had a $1 million LIFO charge last year in the quarter and a small LIFO credit of about $2 billion this year.","Moving into SG&A, our SG&A percentage year-over-year in the quarter was higher by 5 -- by 4 basis points coming in at 10.26 this year compared with a 10.22 last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same four columns for all of fiscal \u201814 both reported and without gas deflation. Columns three and four first quarter both reported and without gas deflation.","Going across these line items, operations were a minus 2 and a plus 1 for the year and a plus 8 and plus 16 for the quarter. Remember pluses means lower year-over-year SG&A. Central, minus 3 and minus 3 in the year and minus 1 and minus 1 in the quarter. Stock compensation minus 2 and minus 2 for the year and minus 11 and minus 11 for the quarter and total would be again for reported for all of fiscal \u201914 SG&A was higher year-over-year by 7 basis points, without gas deflation higher by 4, this year in the first quarter it was higher by 4 reported and better or lower by 4 without gas deflation.","And little elaboration on this, core operations SG&A again was lower by 8, but lower by 16 ex gas impact. Within operations without gas our payroll SG&A percentage was 9 basis points better year-over-year, particularly good showing and certainly a reflection of a strong sales, as well as strong gas sales which have lower SG&A. While benefits to workers comp related expenses were about 4 basis points worse year-over-year.","Central expense was slightly higher year-over-year in the quarter by a basis point, increase IT spending is, we continue to monetize, as I mentioned, within this number that was about 3 minus -- minus 3 basis points and that will continue in those types of increments we think. The increase was partially offset, of course, by improved payroll in central, as well as by 2 basis points.","Finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation was higher year-over-year by 11. I should point out that the year-over-year basis points variances for the six months item will be quite a bit less in Qs 2 and 3, and higher year-over-year in Q4, but not as big negative as variances we've seen in Q1.","Again, if you think about it, with most of the option -- most of the RSUs vesting over five years, you take out the one that -- finally vested, so you take out the expense back when the stock was in the 50s and you add one when the stock was in the 125, 130s when we did that one in October this year.","All told, hold on, here, last thing, on the income statement pre-opening expense, $24 million last year, it was lower or better improvement by 15 -- by 9 million or 15 million this year. Again, we opened nine units this year compared to 13 last year.","So all told, reported operating income for the quarter totaled $668 million last year and $770 million this year, an increase of 15% or up $102 million in the quarter. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same year-over-year with Q1 \u201815 coming in at $26 million versus $27 million last year in the quarter.","Interest income and others I mentioned earlier was quite a bit higher year-over-year, $18 million last year versus $35 million this year, up $17 million. Actual interest income reported for the quarter was slightly up, I think it was little less than a $1 million.","The other component of equity earnings within this line item was higher by 16. This again relates to this marking to market gains on FX contracts used to -- used to source U.S. merchandise in our U.S. -- principally our U.S. merchandise in our international operations.","Overall pretax income was up 18% versus last year\u2019s quarter from $659 million last year to $779 million this year. In terms of tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in a little higher than last year. It came in at a 35.2% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 34.6%. The decrease is mostly due do to a few net discrete items that benefited last year by about $5 million and a couple of a negative discrete items, which totaled about an increase in the taxes of about $1 million this year.","Overall net income was up 17% versus last year\u2019s first quarter from $425 million last year to $486 million this year. Quick rundown on couple of other topics. Balance sheet, depreciation and amortization for the quarter came in at $254 million. In terms of accounts payables as a percent of inventories, you have the balance sheet attached to press release.","Now, on that, it showed a reported number this year of 101% payables to inventories, up about two percentage points from 99% last year. That of course includes construction payables and other payables not just merchandise.","We took up everything and just said merchandise payables as percent of inventory. Last year in Q1, it was 89%, up three percentage points to 92% this year. Again I think, a reflection of good inventory control but also strong sales. Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter ended at $14,453,000. This year came in slightly lower at 14,372,000 about $81,000 lower.","If you take out FX, FX was about a minus 250 -- $250,000 to that number. So if you take out FX, we are actually up average inventory per warehouse of about $169 million, still a very small increase of 1.2% on that normalized basis compared to the 7 plus percent sales increase.","No real issues with inventory levels going into last few weeks before calendar year and Christmas for the holidays. They are in good shape. In the past couple of months, we have received questions about possible inventory issues due to the work slowdowns and shipping along the West Coast. I\u2019m sure like many retailers, we did what we always do to bring in seasonal merchandise a little earlier if required and necessary.","Overall it was not a big issue for November and December and it\u2019s not currently a big issue. Looking ahead into January and February, it's really not a big issue, perhaps even a small issue from seasonal furniture and some other types of items like that and talking to the merchants, not big delays but a little bit of a backup.","In terms of CapEx, first quarter \u201815, we spent $555 million. Our fiscal \u201815 CapEx is estimated to be in the $2.5 billion plus range. This compares to last year\u2019s $2 billion. So, up pretty significantly year-over-year with our ramp up and expansion. All the complementary things that go along with that, with depot expansion, and of course, the IT expenses that I had just mentioned as well.","In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend of 0.355 a share or $1.42 annualized. Based on shares outstanding is about $625 million annually. We did buy a little stock back in Q1 about $18 million at an average price of $126.43. And the first, I believe, five weeks of this quarter we were under blackout from the prior year with -- until we were able to report first quarter and so we didn\u2019t buy heck of a lot during the quarter.","Costco Online, we\u2019re now in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. For the quarter, sales and profit were up over the year. E-commerce sales were up 20%, up 19% on a comp basis and up 21% excluding FX. A rep stores represents about 3% of our total sales, just under 3%.","We continue to -- from really going back couple of years ago, where we platform decide, we\u2019ve gone through a couple of iterations of improving our mobile applications as I think I mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve combined some of our e-commerce merchandise efforts with our inline efforts. We think that\u2019s been a big help to us. We\u2019ve added a few categories like apparel, health and beauty aids and few extra Kirkland signature items. We've certainly improved timing of shipments by shipping what we ship directly instead of from the manufacturer from one depot to a few depots around the country. Our international markets, stay tuned, maybe one additional country by fiscal year end \u201815, certainly lease one by the end of calendar \u201815.","In terms of a few other things that we talked about in the past, Google Shopping experience -- Express is now being offered in six markets in the U.S. Bay Area, which is recent -- now geographically expanded from its initial testing 10 months ago.","The Los Angeles area, New York City, Manhattan and more recently in October, the test continued into three new cities, Chicago, DC and Boston. Again, it\u2019s too early to completely tell but we're seeing some increased overall spend and it\u2019s been a good partner to work with Google. We continue to increase our offerings and categories in these tests as well.","Instacart, it\u2019s now in 13 markets. This is where customer in this cart order through its cart. They come in and buy merchandise and deliver it to the customer. That\u2019s needed to expand as well and boxed as now in three markets, I think, up from two.","Lastly, I think you saw the release, maybe we talked about it with Ali Baba team all in being shipped out of our Taiwan operations. We\u2019re shipping -- I think we\u2019re up to about 125, 130 items, mostly various food or sundries or harbor related items, about half our [indiscernible] Signature. It's great but it's new and we\u2019ll see where it goes from here but certainly get our name noted a little bit over there as well.","In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a lot going -- nothing going on in Q2, just a few in Q3. We have five openings, although two of them are relocation. So, net of three. And we\u2019ve got 20 plan for the 16-week fourth quarter. Most of those look pretty good at this point. It\u2019s just how they -- the timing of them.","In fiscal \u201814, for all the fiscal \u201814, which ended of course at the end of August, we added 29 units or about 5% unit square footage growth. In \u201815, assuming we add the 30 to 31 units on a base of 663, we would -- that would also be about 5% square footage growth.","If we get to 31, it will be 18 in the U.S., three each in Japan and Mexico, two each in Australia and Korea and one each in Canada, U.K. and Taiwan. So U.S. for square footage numbers at Q1 end total square footage stood at 96,437,000 square feet.","With that, I\u2019m going to turn it back over to Erica for any questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So Rich, I want to drill on a little bit on growth by category. So two were up, two were down, the two that were down are some fresh food and hard line. Fresh food was solely passthrough of inflation and was hard line\u2019s entirely mix?","Richard Galanti","Fresh food was certainly inflation in U.S. holding prices, like you know, we do. Things I know again soundbite anecdotal. Butter and milk is way up and so -- therefore cheese. And so you\u2019ve got those types of items. On the other side, some of it\u2019s electronics, that's more competitive and we\u2019re part of that. And so a little of it is mix but \u2026.","John Heinbockel","Yeah.","Richard Galanti","\u2026in our view, nothing really has the ordinary.","John Heinbockel","And then when you look at the two that were up and I think they were not up a lot, is that solely mix and where is Kirkland, I guess, Kirkland would have the big impact in food and sundries. That\u2019s what would show up. Is that primarily driving the better mix?","Richard Galanti","Honestly, I don\u2019t have that level of detail in front of me. I\u2019m looking -- first of all, none of the ups or downs were -- they were in the 10 to 25 basis point range, basically up or down. So not a lot of jumping either way. So my guess is a little of its mix. KS helps but clearly KS, the big penetration increase of KS from 0 to 25% over the last high teens are 20 years. Those increments are smaller now. And so -- yes, it helps but it doesn\u2019t help like the days when you're adding a percentage point or two in a year sometimes.","John Heinbockel","All right. Then, lastly on -- you talked about FX and inventory, even putting that aside, obviously inventory is under awfully good control, is that -- is more of that in-store or is more of that sort of backstage between your vendor in the stores?","Richard Galanti","Keep in mind, if we are turning our inventories 12 plus times a year, everything is pretty fast paced. If you are in Canada or Japan or wherever, and you're buying -- buyers using FX contracts because they\u2019ve got, in most cases, U.S. dollar denominated inventory payables. They are going to lock-in based on what they got coming in, what they know if they are going to have pay out in dollars. And at time when they are comfortable with -- based on that conversion rate, they are comfortable with the price where they are going to sell in their local currency in their local country.","So it\u2019s pretty straightforward. In fairness, as you know, it\u2019s some quarters year-over-year, some quarters it\u2019s a $10 million gain, some times it\u2019s $10 million loss. This time, it was a little better. I think partly a reflection of the weakness and the strength in the dollar, how quickly that's strengthened it, particularly in a couple of countries.","John Heinbockel","It\u2019s nothing you are doing structurally -- although there is nothing you are doing structurally to take inventory working capital out of the system?","Richard Galanti","No. I mean, we do that -- I mean, that\u2019s just kind of one of the mantras that we try to do anyway. Mind you, I mean, this is an example from gosh, 20 years ago in the tobacco business which is a very high volume, not as high one is used to be but a very high volume business, a very fast turning business. A number of years ago, the big -- the majors offered -- let's say whatever the terms were, x percent discount, if paid within seven days. And then they came back and said, we\u2019ll give you an extra half a point, if you pay one day EFT or ACH or whatever, it was. So 0.5% for paying six days early.","It\u2019s no brainer, but you take a high volume item like that. And it goes from a lot of -- probably 100% payable to 0 almost. So I mean, that\u2019s an extreme example. You\u2019ve got gas working the other way where accounts payable is probably 600% or 700%.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Siber","Good morning. This is Joshua Siber on for Simon Gutman. Just curious looking back how our customers reacting to lower gasoline prices and have you seen any trade up from regular to premium?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know -- I think we saw more premium anyway but I don\u2019t know that at the top of my head. I think the reflection that our shopping frequency in our concept continues strong. It is probably a reflection of that. Our view historically has been on something big like this whether it was -- gas was going crazy upward towards $4 a gallon in early to mid \u201808. Did it impact us? It probably impacts a little bit but not as much as some of the dollar type stores or lower demographic stores. We -- similarly, we get a little benefit from it, yes but we don\u2019t think it's big either way for us.","Joshua Siber","Okay, so\u2026.","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s got to be helpful.","Joshua Siber","Sorry, what was that?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s got to help a little.","Joshua Siber","Okay. And then looking forward, if gasoline stays where it\u2019s at right now, is there a change in profitability or have we seen the most of it in Q1?","Richard Galanti","Well, I\u2019ll say what I know. I mean, this is a volatile business as we know. Generally speaking, when it\u2019s declining, it\u2019s the best in terms of profitability. It is more profitable at any level than it used to be a little bit. I think a part of that and again, we -- so it\u2019s a profitable business. It's a lower percent of sales, profitability than the company as a whole.","I think one thing that\u2019s encouraging for us though is, it\u2019s more and more people coming to get their gas. For those that come in this, we\u2019ve heard a people that shop -- that pump gas during opening hours, a little over 50 of them now come in and shop. And so even if one or two of those 50 are incremental, that\u2019s a positive.","We\u2019ve been helped two years in a row now with these outside entities like gasplay.com where nationwide on average, we are the lowest priced. That\u2019s helped. I know, our gallon comps in the first quarter were low single digits, which is really off the charge in terms of getting people into our parking lot, that's good.","Joshua Siber","Okay. Again, if you don\u2019t mind, if I could add just one more, if you could discuss, has there been a mentality or strategic shift on e-commerce front. If you feel you\u2019ve gotten more aggressive over the past 6 to 12 months?","Richard Galanti","I think the things that I mentioned is probably been over the past 6 to 18 or 24 month but certainly we -- we've added a few SKUs, expanded some categories, trying to get people to think of it, not just as the place that I can buy patio furniture or big TV but also some regular higher velocity items.","And yes, nothing, I think has been more, if you look -- if I just looked at year-over-year sales increases on a comp basis, it wasn't a couple of years ago. It was kind of in the mid-single -- stuck in the mid single digits and last year, it was in the high teens and this quarter, it continues in that very high teen, low 20. So I think that\u2019s a reflection of the things that we've done but nothing new and dramatic in the last six months continuation of that.","Joshua Siber","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom","Good morning, Richard. Just to clarify on the gross margin grade, did you say that x gas, the quarter was down 13 basis points?","Richard Galanti","The quarter is down but again, it\u2019s also like -- it's under the phrase, no good deed goes unpunished as over the years as I\u2019ve tried to explain this in a little matrix. You almost need a three-dimensional matrix given the gas was strong and gas gross margins were very strong relative to the very low gross margin business. That disproportionately rates those two lines in that little matrix such that -- and that's why I pointed out if you could adjust food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, those four core areas, which, gosh, are better 80 plus percent of our business. Those were year-over-year were down two basis points, two of those sub departments up, 10 to 25 basis points, two of them down 10 to 25 basis points. So the core business is pretty much flat year-over-year. But it shows in that chart that way because they had higher dollar penetration of gas.","Charles Grom","Okay. So the up two basis points were more or less compared to, say, that up six or seven basis points that you posted in the third and fourth quarter?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. But it was down two and not upside.","Charles Grom","I\u2019m sorry, down 2. Yeah, okay. Okay, I got it. And then on a CapEx guidance, you had a big acceleration from this year versus last year, yet store growth was pretty consistent. Just wondering if you could speak to the delta, is it IT spend, is it land or just what's driving the increase?","Richard Galanti","Well. It\u2019s also former locations including relos. I think it\u2019s probably at least a 100 of it. International was more expensive. We probably are spending more this year on depot type stuff. All I\u2019m rounding here but depots, I bet year-over-year is 100, 150 higher. So it\u2019s probably -- but year-over-year in the prior year, there was probably 75 to 100 in IT and excluding from the leap year. But the big things are in.","Certainly for the year, that 25 to 26 number, we have an original budget probably a little higher than that. But we know that a couple of them flip and so that assumes land baking for the first part of next year. But clearly we are spending more on some of these international locations in a confident way frankly. I mean, some of the ones in Asia as you know not coming with so far have been relatively no-brainers.","Charles Grom","Okay. Just last question on the balance sheet. Roughly, $70 per share in cash, any updated thoughts on and getting a little bit more systematic on the buyback from doing so much each quarter, so much each year as opposed to setting up the grid and any thoughts on the current dividend 1% yield is lot lower than some of your consumer stable peers?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Our Board discusses it in every quarterly Board Meeting. Again, I guess I learned that the metrics works when stocks move slowly in either direction. We have had that high-quality problem that we put the makers in place and then in some cases, we are locked in for five or six weeks due to blackout, and then it moves well above several dollars of accretion we gave it.","I think we want to be more systematic, but I can\u2019t say when it will be. We will talk to you next quarter but certainly, given that we grant to these 40, 200 or 300 employees annual grants that are just in the high threes, the 3.8 million shares or something. We want to at least come to that, I think on an ongoing basis and we certainly did not do that on a quarterly basis this quarter. But the year is still young and we will see. We will let you know next quarter.","Charles Grom","All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck.","Richard Galanti","As it relates to the dividend, again, that\u2019s the conversation we continue to have and we look at all. And we recognize that as first priority is CapEx and then tied for second, if you will or few other things that we\u2019ll continue to look at. I\u2019m sure we will just do things over time but beyond a timetable that we feel comfortable.","Charles Grom","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. A couple of questions. I mean, first off on gross margins. If you look at that, you may have discussed in the prepared remarks, I apologize. But the ancillary gross margin benefit you saw in, beginning here in Q1, can you just discussed the drivers of that and how should we think about coming to sustainability of that over the next two quarters?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, the bigger hurdle was gas. As I mentioned, I think five or six, or five or seven, or six or seven of our ancillary businesses all had up year-over-year gross margins. Most particularly was gas. And so is that sustainable? No. It\u2019s never sustainable. You see where gas prices are now, so it's continuing. But again that could be fleeting and we have been asked the question. Well, when you get these outsized profits, are you more aggressive in pricing? We don\u2019t sit down and say let's use this many dollars but certainly we are going to be aggressive and that\u2019s what we do for living. So, I think that buffers a little bit as well.","Brian Nagel","It\u2019s actually goes in my next question. I think, Richard, you already answered it. In the marketplace, if we look at Costco gas right now, I know from a competitive standpoint Costco gas versus competitors, you typically price below. You are saying that -- when prices are doing what they\u2019ve done, you essentially kept the competitive relationship the same in various markets.","Richard Galanti","We\u2019ve improved the competitive relationship in our minds.","Brian Nagel","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder","Hi. It\u2019s Dan Binder. Congrats on a good quarter. Just want to follow-up on the gas discussion, with all the movement in the gallon comps and the pricing, where are we now as a percentage of sales for gas?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019ll have somebody calculate it right now for you. Hold on a second.","Dan Binder","Okay. My other question, if you want to focus on that, first, is on consumer electronics. You talked to a lot of strength there. Any color you can give us around, sort of the breadth of that strength, where you are seeing it, what you are seeing with 4K TV and competitive pricing?","Richard Galanti","First of all, as you know, we introduced several Apple products over the last year. That's a very competitive business for retailers and for us as well. We know that. But we won\u2019t have that product for our members. 4K TVs are going well. I believe that on those higher end TVs, we tend to be the outlier in terms of driving sales of those. But it is still small relative to the entire category of that component.","Phone business is very strong. You\u2019ve seen what we've done with our kiosks out there and not only phone businesses have been strong, added to that, we've added the Apple brand there as well. And then the various tablets. So there's a lot of different things in that area that are helping the sales strength. Again, I think it tends to be a little more competitive. Apple is part of that. That\u2019s pretty much it. Nothing out of the ordinary, I mean, these things fluctuate up and down a little bit. We are pleased of the strength of the comps in that area.","Dan Binder","And then\u2026","Richard Galanti","By the way, in terms of the question about gas penetration, for the quarter it was about 10.5%.","Dan Binder","10.5%. And just a quick question on the cannibalization rate. I know it hasn\u2019t really changed much. I think it was like 50 basis points in any given month on the comp. I was just curious. Can you give us an idea of what you're seeing on the bounce back of those clubs once you cannibalize it? Does it come back to sort of historical volumes within year, two years, has that been changing at all as you\u2019ve been doing more fill-ins?","Richard Galanti","Generally, it\u2019s a year or maybe slightly over a year. I mean, generally when we open it, when we cannibalize our own units, you might take anywhere as much as 10% or 15% from nearby unit or units. And a year, a year and a half later you are pretty much back. Going forward, not looking back the past year of course. And again, it varies but overall it's been pretty unpredictable for us. Based on zip code analysis and where the members are shopping from, we generally know.","And what we find is the benefit really is, when we pick up a few extra members yes, not a lot where we pick up a lot of frequency. If you have a loyal member that\u2019s shopping and making these numbers up once a month because they are a 30 minute drive away from a Costco and all of a sudden, they are 10 minute driveway and it becomes a significantly more regular shopping frequency.","Dan Binder","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler","It\u2019s Meredith Adler. I was wondering -- I\u2019m still somewhat new to the Costco story. If you could talk about where you see the most potential growth? Obviously, you don\u2019t have a lot of locations in Continental Europe and yet it\u2019s tough to get open warehouses there. When you look at Asia, do you feel like you\u2019ve still got a lot more growth in those markets and what about the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","Well, if you had asked me five years ago, where we would expect to be now, I would say our goal is to get up to about 30 locations a year by this time and probably, we be right to that middle point of trending from majority in the U.S. to less than half in the U.S. If you look at this year next, it\u2019s 30 -- roughly 30 a year, still a little over half in the U.S. I think 16 or so last year and I think I mentioned 18 out of 31 this year.","So, that's by the way a function that we\u2019ve continued to be successful and while we will still get another unit opened in the Puget Sound or perhaps in the Portland area one day or hopefully, every year or two, we get another LA unit in the Greater LA market of 45 or 50 units. But their precision points now where locations where we need to go.","But we are finding in a lot of these cities and markets like Baton Rouge, New Orleans last year. So that's probably upped our expectation a little bit about our opportunities here in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've got 10 or 11, I believe in each of Korea and Taiwan, maybe 12. And we think that we can go into the mid-to-high 20s there over time. But, again, it takes some time to get done and where.","Japan is certainly a bigger market for us. We\u2019ve got 23, I believe, 22 or 23. We should have a lot more than that. But we went from 9 to 21 or something in little over two years. So we are doing well there. And we just -- as I mentioned, opened our seventh in Australia. While Australia is what two-thirds of the size population wise as Canada, where we have 90 or so units, we have seven in Australia. I'm not suggesting we are going to have 45 in Australia anytime soon. But certainly we will get more than seven.","Western Europe, all of Europe is certainly an opportunity for us. It is tough to get in even in the worst of economies where we have been successful with about four years of effort getting one unit opened in Spain, with the second coming towards the middle to the end of next calendar year. And we still finally get our first unit opened in France. So it takes some time but we are persistent and we will be around.","Meredith Adler","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark Miller","Hi. Good morning. A slightly different question on gas prices and my historical recollection is that when gas prices were high, more consumers might go out of their way to drive to Costco and then that was viewed as a historical benefit to traffic. But the inverse does not appear to be happening and so I\u2019m wondering what in your view has changed or I mean, do you think there is a risk of gas prices stay lower that you may not get quite as much a lift in terms of traffic to the stores as in the past?","Richard Galanti","You are skyrocketing back in \u201908, going up towards $4 for the first time. We are on news every night somewhere, whether it\u2019s a small-town in Montana or Los Angeles and where is the best place for my guests. So that\u2019s certainly was a positive. Theoretically, oil amazes the people, as prices fall, that will be less of an incentive. I think it's a greater -- that membership value proposition. When a gas play.com comes ounces $40 plus million inputs from customer, from drivers out there saying that we are the best lowest price nationally by $0.14 or $0.16 that resonates. The fresh foods, second to none in our view were biased but that drives a lot of business.","The pharmacy, frankly, I think deserved credit. We get through that in terms of pricing. So the fact that we -- we are proud of fact that we take care of our employees. All those things are positives. I think once you've come to Costco for gas and we got you into the warehouse, there is reasons why you are going to come back. And I think we're starting to appreciate the fact that it is all of the above. It\u2019s some of the crazy KS items that are KS items where you\u2019ve got the money, you got to buy them at Costco. Although there are few other places now you can buy them, but we are selling into those people.","Mark Miller","Your traffic just continues to amaze. My other question is on China and so, I understand it\u2019s very early with Alibaba. But I want to ask is there any change in your long-term thinking on China? You did say that there is a benefit of getting your name known there. I mean, historically, you\u2019ve had some reservations but are you -- should we be thinking that comp growth is in the future there and what might inform that? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Yeah. I think it\u2019s in the future. But if you had asked me that same question 10 years ago, I would say I think it's in the future. And not being acute about it, every couple three years, Senior Management, both international Senior Management and it is a giant market. We are confident about what we do. We are also very hands-on and we got a lot of things going on in a lot of directions and we kind of know. We know that the anticipation is somebody is getting their first. Well, people go out in other places first and when we will come in, we will do just fine. So it will be at some point. I don't know when, if you said -- in most likelihood in the next 5 to 10 years, sure. Next two to five years, maybe. Next Thursday, we are not ready yet.","Mark Miller","Okay. All right. Thanks Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.","Chris Horvers","Thanks. Good morning. So, I want to follow-up on the acceleration in the core comps over the past year. It seems like most of the acceleration is seen in the hardlines category. So would you agree with that, or has there been movements toward the high-end of the ranges that you provide in softlines and fresh foods and so forth? And within CE, is that TV turning positive, plus the addition of Apple driving the hardlines rebound?","Richard Galanti","Well, that's one of the things I think I mentioned. Tires have been good this year. Automotive, lawn and garden have been good and we have season for that now. Apparel has continued to be strong and we enjoyed a couple of years on a compounded basis. Apparel comps saw increases in the mid-to-high teens. So that of course at some point has got to come down a little bit, but the organic is helping. I think in the last two years, we've little more than doubled organic sales from the low billions to closing in on $3 billion currently. And so that\u2019s -- all those things help.","Chris Horvers","So within the hardlines category, is that TV and Apples, essentially that\u2019s driven that acceleration within the major sort of\u2026?","Richard Galanti","I will say TV and Apple are probably the top two without looking at the detail. Phones are probably in there too. Phone could be first or second for us. I mean, phones are first but phones, TV and the reintroduction of some of the Apple items.","Chris Horvers","And when you didn't sell, let\u2019s say iPads, were you selling iPhones in the wireless kiosks?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Chris Horvers","Okay.","Richard Galanti","We are. By the way as comment was made here in my office, those are the big volume categories. But white goods are up. Now that we do a big white goods business, audio is up. Again, smaller business but we -- and that\u2019s not just headphones, it\u2019s the sound systems and all kinds of stuff. But the big volume areas are those three that I mentioned.","Chris Horvers","And was Apple sort of a point in time add back to the store base overall? Or did that start in let\u2019s say June and then ramp up over the past five months?","Richard Galanti","I think that's right. But it's a piece of it. It\u2019s not the driving piece.","Chris Horvers","Understood. Understood. Yeah. And then on depreciation, can you give us some color how to think about the depreciation? I know you -- I don\u2019t believe you historically guide to it, but with the incremental CapEx over the past couple years it would seem like dollars per week or dollars per quarter that will continue to arise for, I think the next couple years and so any color there?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. I hope it continues to rise forever. Probably, the simplest way to do it is look at what is done for each of the last several years, year-over-year in dollars. My guess it\u2019s somewhere around 10%ish and that's probably as good a guess. Maybe, if you want to add a little bit to it for IT modernization, as you know, over four or five-year period on an incremental basis, we\u2019re probably spending close to $0.5 billion, that generally once these different modules and components are put into operation, they then to get amortized over five to seven years and so maybe that adds a little bit to that $1 billion plus number.","Chris Horvers","And then where does that depreciation tend to show up in terms of the margin bucket? I know you talked about central, but is that core as well?","Richard Galanti","It's all SG&A. Virtually, all SG&A.","Chris Horvers","Okay. Understood. Thanks very much, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Kevin Heenan","Hi. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. You had called out apparel as being strong within softlines. I was just wondering if there were any particular categories of brands within apparel that were particularly strong in the quarter.","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s really all of the above. I mean, we have made a conscious -- over the last couple of years, a conscious effort to both, with brands and with Kirkland Signature, go bigger and deeper, mashing out big quantities in the stuff. And so it really is all over the board, names that you\u2019ve come to know like Dockers and Levi's and Carhartt and just a variety of ones. But also the KS, whether its women\u2019s activewear or what was -- the men\u2019s wear pant, certainly the five plus million KS shirts and men's dress shirts that we sell a year. So it\u2019s a lot of things.","Kevin Heenan","Cool. Thanks. And then just my last question. We noticed you guys have handheld scanners now in store. As you are checking out, we\u2019re wondering, kind of how that test was going, understanding information around that?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Well, I think the handheld scanner -- well, there is two things that we used in handheld scanner. We give some level of autonomy to the operators on that. Some regions embraced it little more than others. Generally, what we find and I say there is two uses. One use is your clients are backing up and employee was one of those handheld scanners could go and essentially scan.","It was a small basket. And you will say, if its top fold and you have things under other things, you can\u2019t do it. But they can help speed up the front-end by scanning -- in the case of a limited number of items, those items give that member a little print out with the barcode on it. When the member gets up to the cash register, the cashier can simply scan that barcode. It prints out and tenders that full transaction was all the detail. That\u2019s one way speeding up.","The other thing, its use for is in terms of informing people, when it would make sense for them to convert from a regular member to the Executive Member based on their prior 12 months of purchases. So if lines are backed up a little bit and we can ask the member, if we can scan their card and we can let them know that based on their prior years purchases, they were paid as example in the U.S. of an extra $55 when $10 versus $55 and they would've earned well more than that. And so it\u2019s use for that, but we don't do that all the time because as we've increased shopping frequency, the member who said no doesn\u2019t want to have to say no. I mean, we cannot have. So we did that on a periodic basis.","Kevin Heenan","Got you. All right. Thanks a lot for the information.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. Congrats on the performance and thanks for the details. Regarding a bigger picture question on online, where do you think the mix should go over time? Will it remain a little bit more modest as a percentage of total? And as you look at your guest and the customers like, which factors do people want to see you guys implement over time? And I just wanted to ask about food and protein and fresh food, what\u2019s your outlook for the inflation there? And will your pricing under price the inflation and how do you see that dynamic evolving?","Richard Galanti","Let\u2019s start with the last question. I mean, our fresh foods people use some continuation on prices like cheese and milk and butter. A lot of that has to do with some shortages in China and so increased demand from China that has pushed that out a little bit. There is still some inflation in meat. I believe, you said that that pork expectation was coming back a little bit and cheese is finally coming down a little bit.","So the expectation is yes, but not probably as severe like meat have been up 8% to 10% in prices. They will expect that level of additional inflation going forward but still some. In terms of pricing, generally, we\u2019re going to try to take price increases as early as possible and take price decreases as soon as possible. So if using the famous rotisserie chicken example, we maintain the price, while costs were going up for two years, we didn't -- when the input costs starts going down, we didn\u2019t change the price because we\u2019ve never raised it. But overall, we\u2019re going to lag a little bit because we won\u2019t be competitive.","And getting back to the first question was on Costco.com and mix changes. Yeah, it should continue to inch up more towards. When we started it, it was all big ticket. In many cases hard to take home yourself or hard to install, or hard to put together items, whether its big-screen TVs or furniture or swingsets, you name it.","We certainly wanted to be more than just that and I think again, we've seen some success there, so we keep trying things. What we don't see ourselves is being the entity that's going to deliver two different boxes of kid cereals to your doorstep at seven in the morning. Now we hope and look forward to some of these other entities that are doing those types of quick home deliveries for us to be their supplier, which we seem to be successful doing as well. But overall, we want our site to be thought about a more regular basis as well for our members.","Oliver Chen","Okay.","Richard Galanti","And some of those are health and beauty aid items. Some of those are sundries items will certainly help to close that too.","Oliver Chen","And I\u2019ve used the mobile app. Do you feel like the mobile app is going to be a key part of traffic online for you as it evolves?","Richard Galanti","It will. It\u2019s continuing and when we look at our - when Ginnie Roeglin represents each month in the budget meeting about Costco.com, we have higher and higher percentages of mobile app use. Not as nearly as much as some of the e-commerce entities out there but it\u2019s going in that direction. So, yeah, we\u2019ll keep getting better. Like everything at Costco, while our site is greatly improved from the original mobile apps that we did, there is room for improvement there and we know that.","Oliver Chen","Okay. Thank you. And a last question. On the higher end strength, have you seen customer response in a very positive to higher price points or your assortment, as we see healthier high-end customers as well as your product assortment being very appealing?","Richard Galanti","Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. That\u2019s what we do. I mean, since the beginning of time, we\u2019ve constantly try to trade customers up to better quality. We\u2019re still a merchant. We just want to sell a lot of stuff and higher-end stuff. And frankly, we can show great savings from that. If you go into our warehouses right now, it is partly for the holiday time and I\u2019ve seen some $3,000 and $5,000 and $7,000 wine and spirits pricing, which are great values at those price points.","Certainly, our jewelry are higher end. Certainly, the fact that we do a great penetration in the bigger sized televisions, so that\u2019s something. Anecdotally, I remember also, at the end of calendar \u201808 and then to calendar \u201809, when economy went south fast. And I remember and of course, at the end of \u201808 and then to early \u201909, when we took some extraordinary markdowns on things like patio furniture in January, February because the economy just hitting people, weren\u2019t buying that much those big-ticket discretionary items.","I remember, as we entered June, July as the buyers are getting ready to commit for the upcoming end of \u201809 into 2010 season, our CEO, Jim, at the time and our Head of Merchandising were reminding the buyers, don't start bringing the price points down. If you want to come back for a little volume, quantity fine, but let\u2019s -- we've traded our members up and our members expect higher end goods. Let\u2019s keep that going, because that's what we are -- that what helps us, one of the things that helps a standout in our view.","Oliver Chen","Thanks. Thanks for the comments on the luxury goods and that experience. Best regards for the holidays.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matt Fassler","Thanks a lot. Good morning. It\u2019s Matt Fassler. Thanks for keep the call going here. My one question at this stage relates to IT modernization. Richard, if you could just talk about qualitatively, what you've gotten done and what is still on the common? And then how you would expect those additional investments to further enable the online in e-commerce effort? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, for those of you who have noticed for long time, it\u2019s going to keep us alive and growing. I mean, our view is as that, we were at the top of our game in terms of keeping systems, old legacy systems as long and as cheaply as possible. And the recognition is that we did have to modernize, we knew that and we started that really in earnest about two, two and a half years ago, getting ready to start that process.","So, and our goal, of course, is to take us over the next 10 years to double our company and I\u2019m not trying to -- we don\u2019t have 10-year budgets, but certainly, at a reasonable growth factor that should be what we want to do. We need systems to do that particularly as we going to other countries and expand in existing smaller countries right now that we\u2019re in, smaller number of units and as we global source more.","So, all those things are imperative and as you know, we've done very little historically with member data. Don't expect big things from us, but expect any little things still low-hanging food for us. So we\u2019ll be able to do a little more that.","First order of business to get it done, what is being installed so far, we\u2019ve redone the front-end membership system. Right now, if you want to change your address or phone number, you have two ways to do it. You call at 800 number or you go by the membership desk.","Well, if a million or 2 million if you do something every year, its one time each for 2 many people, it\u2019s 2 million times for us. So some simple things like that will start early next year, early to mid next year. But there's certainly lot more to do with that stuff, even some basics.","We also redid the point-of-sale system and that\u2019s in, that\u2019s making -- and when I say that\u2019s in, it\u2019s just in. For the two months -- the last two months of calendar year, we have an unwritten or written rule, you can't -- don\u2019t do anything, just grow up the systems and the warehouse.","And so, while we've now installed it in the number of locations and its will be on pilot and our operators want it and like it, and then it will say, scheduling and few other things, that will be into earnest until during half of calendar \u201915.","There is one other thing, the payroll. We just redid the payroll system and that\u2019s pretty U.S only to start with, which is 70% of our company. And that's again something that\u2019s making life a little easier in the warehouses and there is some small benefits to that there.","The big benefits are when we complete the things that you got to put these things including accounting systems in place first. Our accounting systems are planned to be installed as of this fiscal year end, so at the end of this August, fingers crossed, that will be the best time to do with it, the fiscal year end and currently, we\u2019re on test, but we will tell you more, how we are on test tomorrow.","The -- beyond that, I mean, the big things that the users are excited about, if we look at our depot and truck fleet operation, there is some real savings and efficiencies in our depot operations that their aches to get in place, that still going to be six to 12 -- six to, I will say, six to 18 months out, because these are all overlapped -- these modules overlap each other somewhat.","The challenges going to be as we -- as buyers who are use to doing things one way, have to do things little different. We learned a lot of lessons when we went to Spain. We started with basically the new SAP-oriented system and there, as you might expect there are few Costco people over there. We\u2019ve learned a lot, including pain in the behind things.","So, I think that, we know what the expenses are and we know incrementally, we still got another year, year and half for that, by its own size it will -- then will have level off. Again, I think, looking two to five years out is when we\u2019re going to -- we have got to get over that hump and there will be, I am sure, some growing pains where we make those conversions. But we\u2019ve gotten a lot better of not just doing something and then letting everybody all the users figured out.","We\u2019re using 10s and 20s and 30s of additions of people to certain departments focus entire, taking existing people to know us, our current systems and putting them on these SAP modernization projects. And so, we\u2019ve done a much better job of bringing good people in and committing to two or three years in some cases those people in that area.","Matt Fassler","Thank you so much.","Richard Galanti","So we\u2019ll continue.","Matt Fassler","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","Good morning, everyone. Richard, you may have said it, but I\u2019ll double check on this regarding the gas. What was the year-over-year decrease in the gas price and can you talk about gas gallons on a comp basis increase?","Richard Galanti","The average price per gallon was down 7.3% and the comps were -- the gallons comps were I think 11%, I know it was a low double-digit, 10.5%.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. 10.5.","Richard Galanti","Yeah.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. Thank you. And I\u2019m curious about the buying or having merchandise shift ahead of -- a little bit ahead of sales plan because of some of these slowdowns on -- in the ports? Where is the extra merchandise being stored? Is it in the clubs or is that in your depots, or even offsite?","Richard Galanti","Well, Costco, yeah, no, it\u2019s not offsite. It\u2019s mostly in depots or the clubs. I mean we were stacked tall, but we turned it pretty fast too. It wasn\u2019t a huge issue, it was -- it wasn\u2019t issue, but it -- in terms of logistics of handling it. But basically the depots had little bit more for a few weeks.","Chuck Cerankosky","Okay. So if it is selling it\u2019s there\u2026","Richard Galanti","Yeah.","Chuck Cerankosky","\u2026 just gets it there ahead of time.","Richard Galanti","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Mike Otway","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. I think, first, Richard, you had said that outside of pharmacy that all the other ancillary businesses and their gross margin rates up in the quarter? So, I guess, outside of gas, which is obviously, transitory? How should we think about your ability to get some slight margin improvement on these other businesses over the course of the year?","Richard Galanti","The ancillary, well, most of them were up year-over-year. I mean, a lot of it\u2019s -- it\u2019s particularly in some of the business like Optometry and Hearing Aid. I mean they -- the actual markup on the goods is higher than our range, because we included our own cost of sales calculation, the impact of the Hearing Aid tax or of the Optometrist and things like that. So it's -- but it's a when volume is driven its operating leverage is certainly in my view better than their warehouse as a whole.","So more than anything, I mean, we keep looking to, as you've heard it before, bring prices down. Over the last couple of years when we introduced, I forget what the, it\u2019s 5.0 or 6.0, whatever the next level of the state-of-the-art Hearing Aids under our brand. We lowered the price point by close to $2,000 on by -- on a high-quality Kirkland Signature item made by well-known high-end people and we really drove that business. So we save the customer, we\u2019ve made fewer gross margin dollars, but a lot more units, fewer dollars per unit, but a lot more units","Mike Otway","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just switching gears on the international side, you guys obviously continue to fare pretty well, given the headwinds? But just kind of looking at profitability of the other international business outside of Canada and stepping back, over the last few years, you saw EBIT margins come down slightly in that portion of the business versus I think in the middle part of last decade they were moving up? What's changed and as you add more stores kind of in this segment internationally outside of Canada? What are your expectations for getting profit to move up slightly every year? And I know some of that is new store driven and everything like that but any thoughts there would be great?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think, Craig, our CEO, has said is look that the goal is to first get to three pretax and we\u2019ll go -- see where we go from there. First and foremost, we are going to drive our business. We want to see improved profitability every year. And there's a lots of moving parts and some of these ancillary businesses helped Costco travel. There's a little but it's growing nicely. We\u2019ve got new people in last couple of years in our business centers, what I'll call the 10-plus year test there too. We have them moving in the right direction. We\u2019ve got eight of them and little bit of a few more so.","So there's lots of things out there. The global sourcing initiatives does two things. It's generally limited resource commodity type items in some cases. In our view, what sets us apart in terms of quality and value, and that drives other business. So there's, I think we are less looking and saying how can we -- do we want to -- we want to grow -- first and foremost, we want to grow comps. You can take out inflation and every thing else. Can we get comps in that mid-single digit to a little higher? If we can do that than how we get topline sales a little higher and then how do we leverage that.","We\u2019ll keep doing what we are doing and we are not as concerned about one quarter or one year being a little less. I know we've gone up and down, but certainly we feel comfortable that we've got things in place to keep driving bottomline hopefully a little better than topline. But there will be fluctuations in that.","Mike Otway","Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Hey Richard, another gas question, I know you, love these. From history or maybe the question being when historically, you've moved into a lower gas price environment, big declines year-over-year at the pumps like we are seeing and could see more of. What do you guys tell the buyers to do then? What categories tend to do better when you're having a pretty dramatically falling gas pump prices? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t think we are smart enough to sit around and say with this extra profit what we can do. I talked to Doug Shaw, the head of U.S. merchandising the other day. His view was is that we are doing everything we're doing anyway. This helps some. Do we do a little more, sure but -- it gives us a little bit more umbrella but we are going to keep doing it.","Robby Ohmes","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore.","Greg Melich","Hi. Thanks. Rich. I thought we had a couple of questions left here but could you update us on inflation across the store both in COGS and at the retail level?","Richard Galanti","Yeah, if you look -- here we go. Basically again a very slight deflation for the first 12 weeks where food and sundries has very slight inflation. Sundries is a very slight inflation like less than 10 basis points. Apparel is very slight inflation also less than 10, right. So that\u2019s really end of our fiscal year. And food, of course, for all of fiscal \u201813 was up about 3.5 percentage points on a cost of goods basis.","But again for the first 12 weeks of this month, it's ever so slightly up. Computers and appliances and things like that are down about a point. Gas, of course, is down as you a little bit. And those are pretty much the pulls and it all adds up to being down less than half percentage point since the beginning of our fiscal year. That's versus being up a 0.5 percentage point all of last year from the beginning of the prior fiscal year.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s helpful and that\u2019s at the COGS levels and same with retail?","Richard Galanti","Yeah.","Greg Melich","Okay.","Richard Galanti","Yeah. I would say the same at retail, if its inflation, maybe its a little thick under that because of our lag but overall it's pretty close.","Greg Melich","Great. And then the second question was I think it was on September, you switched your -- interchanged your card partner in Canada. Could you help us understand how that changes the dynamics either in sales or profits in the business? And also remind us, when your Amex deal expires or when that\u2019s due in the U.S.?","Richard Galanti","","Sure. Well, we basically had long-term agreements in Canada and we have one here. We don't really talk about our current contracts. We\u2019ll let you know when and if anything happens. But any ongoing contracts and anything we really don\u2019t talk about. But in Canada, again we made the switch currently for I think about a three-month period ending the end of this month we set both.","So we started accepting MasterCard a couple of months ago. And we\u2019ll continue to accept as well American Express in Canada though the end of the calendar year. Look, we would have done it if it wasn't the most attractive deal for us. And remember -- and I would probably reverse the order if this was 10K for our member and us long term because we are going to continue to try the right value.","And so we think it's -- the transition is always a little bit of a hassle, but we worked well with both our former partner and our new partner. Everybody acts professionally in this thing and these things happen. And we have a good relation currently in the U.S. So we'll see where that goes in the future. But as it relates to Canada, I think we're now up to -- and it\u2019s not required yet. As of last month, we are in the 30s in terms of the percentage of people using MasterCard, recognizing 40 plus percent of our transactions in Canada before anything else is a debit.","And as you might expect MasterCard has a higher penetration of cardholders in Canada. We want to get that rewards-based card out there. And because infinity programs drive sales, not only in Costco but drive reward-based credit card programs. When we get that member using that card, that co-brand card, the same helped through with American Express co-brand. Will they use it elsewhere, it changes and improves the economics for us, which allows us to again provide a better solution to our member and continue to be more aggressive out there.","Greg Melich","It\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s going as expected, fine and stay tuned in the U.S. what we may or may not do in the future.","Greg Melich","That\u2019s great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman","Yeah. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And most have been asked, but I wanted to ask something related to the food side of the business. And I know in the past we've spoken about opportunities within food like new products, maybe organic, natural, more. And I know you've made strides with some of that. But any update on where you stand with organic and natural and how much you could do there?","Richard Galanti","Look I think we can do a lot more. The supply chain is improving and increasing everyday not just for us. Again I think in two years, we've gone to the U.S. from about $1.4 billion to close to $3 billion in organic and that's with supply constraints. So -- our view is there is couple of positives for our view.","One is it's not always a substitute sale. I gave the example and perhaps is an extreme example what for the first 25 million of fresh organic ground beef we did a year and a half or so ago on a multi-hundred million dollar fresh ground beef program. But again $25 million and first 25 million organic, 80% of it was to existing members that historically didn\u2019t buy ground beef from us because they buy organic.","And so that was added sales in that way. The other positive is generally in the retail business. Organic is high -- it was always a higher price point. But it's also generally the higher margin items. This kind of like the sale item you see on white goods is the refrigerator without the icemaker with a small freezer compartment and then you go in, you want the one with all -- the bigger one with all the extra whistles and bells.","Same thing with this, we can generally make a little bit better margin and save the customer more and have a higher price point item. So again its growing. It\u2019s a $3 billion business. I can\u2019t tell you how quickly it will grow, but it's growing certainly faster than our topline overall.","Joe Feldman","Got it. Thank you. And then also wanted to follow-up with the -- you\u2019ve mentioned LivingSocial deal a couple times this quarter, last quarter. Should we expect more on that front or more things like that to come?","Richard Galanti","Well, it's a Catch-22. It worked, recognizing we don\u2019t do a lot of it. But we also don\u2019t want our members to get comfortable waiting -- our people comfortable waiting for the next deal. So we are going to do things on a sporadic basis, on irregular basis. But we at least -- as Craig said to our heads of merchandising e-commerce and membership marketing try some things. And so we are trying some things.","So we are not -- we\u2019ll let you know that the things that we tried generally work. But it's not like we want to change our methodology. We wanted also make sure that the value of the membership is the value of the membership. But we\u2019ll keep trying some things.","Joe Feldman","Got it. Thanks and good luck with this quarter guys.","Richard Galanti","Thank you. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions? And I am sure you guys are tired of listening to me.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And there are no more audio questions at this time.","Richard Galanti","Well, thank you every one and have a good day.","Operator","","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand today\u2019s call over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead, sir.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Kayla. Good morning to everyone. Last night we reported operating results for the 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year that ended August 30. These results are compared to the similar 16 and 52-week periods of fiscal 2014, which ended last year on August 31.","Please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","To begin with our fourth quarter fiscal 2015 operating results, net sales for the fourth quarter came in at $35 billion, up 1% overall a year ago. Comp sales were down 1% on a reported basis, but were up 6% including the negative gas and FX impacts. Gas prices for the quarter were down 21% year-over-year, negatively impacting U.S. comp figures by little more than 3 percentage points, so a plus 6 U.S. comp, excluding gas price deflation.","Foreign currencies overall were weaker relative to the dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter, such that our reported international comps on a reported basis of minus 10% in Canada and a minus 7% international \u2013 in other international. Assuming flat year-over-year FX rates and excluding gas price deflation would have been plus 7% in Canada and plus 6% elsewhere internationally. For the quarter, earnings per share came in at $1.73, up $0.15, or 10% from last year\u2019s $1.58 figure.","In terms of a year-over-year comparison \u2013 the EPS comparison, a few items of note, and the biggest item of note, FX. In Q4 year-over-year, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings this year in Q4, being lower by about $53 million after-tax, or $0.12 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates have been flat year-over-year.","Number two, income taxes. Our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that, in the aggregate, decreased our income tax line by $23 million, or about $0.05 a share. The largest component of the $23 million figure was a $17 million, or almost $0.04 a share income tax benefit that resulted from our decision to repatriate in the near future from Canada back to the U.S. $750 million Canadian, or about $560 million U.S. of cash balances.","Third item of note, IT monetization. As discussed in the past several quarters, our major IT monetization efforts are ongoing and will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through the next fiscal year and possibly beyond, especially as new major systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the fourth quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis, these costs have impacted SG&A by an estimated $22 million, or 6 basis points \u2013 4 basis points without deflation in FX or about $0.03 a share.","And lastly, LIFO. Last year in the fourth quarter we recorded a pre-tax LIFO charge of $11 million pre-tax, or $0.02 a share. This year, we actually had a LIFO credit or a bring back of $14 million pre-tax, or $0.02 a share, lot of that had to do with gas deflation. In terms of new openings, for all of fiscal 2015, we opened 25 new locations, which included two relos, so a net of 23. 12 new in the U.S., three each in Mexico and Japan, and one each in Canada, UK, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia, which therefore ended fiscal 2015 a few weeks back with 23 net new warehouses and a total of 686 locations operating worldwide.","For the current fiscal year 2016, our plans are to add up to 32 net new warehouses, including a few business centers in the U.S. 18 to 20 of the planned new locations will be in the United States with the remaining in international markets, including our second opening in Spain and our first opening planned for France. During the first fourth months of 2016 through calendar year end, we plan to open 13 of those up to 32 warehouses, including two relos of net of 11 and nine in the U.S., one each in Canada, Australia, Japan, and Spain, and then the two U.S. relos are in that 11 figure \u2013 in the 9 figure, sorry. Also, this morning I\u2019ll review with you our membership trends and related activities, our e-commerce activities, plenty of discussion on margins and SG&A and recent stock repurchase activities.","Okay. So for first \u2013 fourth quarter results, sales, again, for the fourth quarter and the 16 weeks ended August 30, were $35 billion, up 1% from last year\u2019s $34.8 billion. On a reported basis, again, comps were down minus 1%. For the quarter just minus 1% reported comp figure was a combination of an average transaction decrease of about 4.5% for the quarter. And again, this included the detriment from FX of a little over 4%, and gasoline price deflation of a little over 2.5% impact. So as you can see, excluding the \u2013 these negative factors, comps overall were up 6%, and the transaction actually on an ex-gas and FX would have been slightly positive. And an average frequency increase of just under 4%, at about 3 and 3.25%.","In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions registered low single-digit comp increases, again, that \u2013 these numbers include the impact of gas deflation of little over 3% in the U.S. with the Midwest, Texas, and California being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, the strongest results in Australia, Mexico, Taiwan, and Spain, recognizing Spain only has one new unit \u2013 one unit. In terms of comp sales by merchandise categories for the quarter, for food and sundries, comps were mostly flat for the quarter, again, all these items \u2013 all these figures include about a 4% detriment from FX.","The better-performing departments were deli, sundries and candy. Within Hardlines in the low single-digit range, better-performing departments were sporting goods, hardware, and automotive. Our consumer electronics were negative low single-digit year-over-year positive low single-digit ex-FX. For Softlines, comps were in the low single-digit range, better-performing departments included home furnishings and domestics. And within Fresh Foods, comps were in the low single-digit range as well with best results in deli, produce and meat.","Moving on down the income statement to membership fees, on a reported basis, membership fees came in at $785 million, or 2.24% of sales, that\u2019s up $17 million, or 2% in dollar and up 3 basis points. Again, FX have big impact on these dollar figures on a \u2013 assuming flat year-over-year FX, the 2% dollar increase would have been up 6%.","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, 91% in the U.S. and Canada and 88% worldwide. And strong \u2013 also, we\u2019re enjoying strong sign-ups both new and existing warehouses and continued strength in our executive member program. In terms of members at fiscal year end, we had $34.0 million gold star members, up from the most recent quarter of $33.2 million, primary business $7.1 million, up from $7.0 million. We continue to have business add-on members of $3.5 million, so all told member households, 44.6 million at fiscal year end, which is up from 43.7 million 16 weeks earlier. Including additional cards, total cardholders out there stood at 81.3 million in fiscal year end, up from 79.6 million in fiscal quarter ago.","At fiscal year end, executive memberships were 16.1 million, which is an increase of about 400,000 members since Q3 end, so about 25,000 a week increase in the quarter. In terms of membership renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue strong. Total came in at \u2013 rounds up to a 91, and for U.S. and Canada and total worldwide rounds up to an 88.","Getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter on a reported basis was higher year-over-year by 44 basis points coming in at 11.14% this year versus the year ago fourth quarter at 10.70%. Without the impact of gas price deflation, that increase would be up 15 basis points. ","Now I ask you to jot down just two columns of numbers looking just at the fourth quarter here, both, the column one would be reported basis and column two would be without gas deflation. First line item would be core merchandise. On a reported basis, year-over-year up 17 basis points, ex-gas deflation down 8 basis points. Ancillary businesses reported plus 25 without gas plus 18, the 2% reward increasing sales penetration related to executive member sales and the 2% reward minus 5 reported and minus 2 ex-gas.","LIFO, plus 7 and plus 7 and total the reported basis as I mentioned plus 44 basis points in ex-gas plus 15. Now reviewing these figures again the core merchandise component was up 17, but minus 8 without gas primarily a function of improved year-over-year gross margins within our gasoline and several other ancillary and warehouse businesses.","The core merchandize gross margin, which I define as the main four departments, merchandise departments, food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods as a percentage of their own sales were actually up 13 basis points year-over-year; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines were up year-over-year and, while fresh foods was a little lower.","Ancillary and other business gross margins were up as I mentioned in a chart there up 25 basis points plus 80 without gas. We enjoyed broad based strength across most of our ancillary businesses with year-over-year gross margin improvements in gas optical hearing aids as well as operating results and ecommerce business centers, travel and executive member services.","And LIFO in the fourth quarter as I mentioned it year-over-year was a 4 basis point benefit or $40 million, compared to a 3 basis point detriment a year ago of $11 million.","Our year-end inventory shrink results were in line with our all time best results and our inventory positions were at great shape. All in all gross margin of inventory is in good shape. Moving onto the SG&A.","Our SG&A percentages year-over-year in the fourth quarter were higher or worse by 27 basis points coming in at right at 10.00% of sales this year, compared to 9.73% last year. Again taking out gas deflation essentially flat year-over-year higher or worse by 1 basis point.","Again I\u2019ll ask you to jot down the two columns Q4 reported and Q4 ex-gas deflation in terms of operations reported minus 15 or higher by 15 basis points, without gas deflation plus 8 basis points or lower or better by 8.","Central the minus 7 and minus 5, stock compensation at minus 5 and a minus 4. All told we came in on a reported basis higher by 27 basis points in SG&A and again ex-gas deflation minus 1 basis point.","And looking at these figures of the operations component of the SG&A was higher again or worse by 15 and again excluding gas lower or better by 8, within operations ex-gas deflation core warehouse payroll and other operating expenses were better by 10 basis points and half of which was improvement in payroll percent.","Central expense was higher or worse by 7 basis points year-over-year, 5 without gas with nearly all of that variance could be from an IT monetization efforts 6 and 5 basis points respectively without gas deflation.","Lastly stock compensation expense represented again a minus 5 and minus 4 without gas, just we have over 4,000 people on our plan and that\u2019s done well as a compensation tool. Next on the income statement is pre-opening higher by $12 million coming in at $27 million this year versus $15 million a year ago.","Last year in fourth quarter we had 10 openings, this year we had 13. Of the $12 million year-over-year incremental expense, which is about $0.02 a share little under half of it is due to incremental units 13 versus 10, the rest about $7 million of variance is simply increasing pre-opening expense associated with upcoming openings in the first several months of our new fiscal year versus the similar period of a year earlier.","All told reported operating income in the quarter increased $65 million or 6% year-over-year to $1.156 billion this year. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was higher year-over-year coming in at $40 million this year from third - up from $35 million a year ago.","This is mostly due to the interest expense on the billion dollar debt offering that was completed earlier this calendar year to fund a portion of the special dividend. Interest income and other was higher or better year-over-year by $10 million coming in at $40 million this year the fourth quarter versus $30 a year ago. Actual interest income for the quarter came in at $12 million, compared to $17 million a year ago so actually lower by 5.","The other component of interest income and other was higher or better by $15 million primarily related to various FX related items [indiscernible] with the foreign countries when they\u2019re locking in some of their FX needs.","Overall pretax income was up 6%, or $70 million this year versus last year. In terms of our tax rate, our company tax rate for the quarter came in lower than last year 32.7% this year versus 35.1% last year in the quarter. Again, we benefited from several discrete items in Q4 as I explained \u2013 discussed earlier in the call. Such that, overall net income was up 10%, or $70 million, coming in at $767 million this year in the fourth quarter versus last year fourth quarter net earnings of $697 million.","For a quick rundown of other items, while the balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, a couple of quick balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter came in at $351 million and for the year $1.127 billion. Our accounts payable as a percent of inventories on a reported basis was essentially a 100%, 101% both last year and in this year fiscal year end.","Ex non-merchandise payables mostly construction related would be that, both the last year in fourth quarter and in this year fourth quarter came in at 89%. In terms of inventory for warehouse, average inventory for warehouse was up 200,000, or 2% to $13 million in Q4 in this year, up from $12.8 million. That\u2019s \u2013 the actual number, again, excluding, assuming FX was flat year-over-year would have been 535,000, or up about 4.2%. The increase pretty much spread across many departments, and no real surprises there. Overall, our inventory is in good shape as I mentioned earlier.","In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter, we spent $805 million and for all of 2015, the capital expenditures totaled $2.4 billion. Our estimate for fiscal 2016, CapEx is an increase from that $2.4 billion level somewhere in the high 2s, somewhere between $2.8 billion, $3 billion. This year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year versus last year. The increase spending for remodeling, expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-dock and distribution operations, and expenditures related to our ongoing IT spending for monetization efforts. In terms of Costco online, we\u2019re still operating Costco online in four countries; U.S., Canada, UK and Mexico.","For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3.5 billion, up a little over 20% for the year. Comp sales in e-commerce, again, were also up 20% for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. In terms of expansion, I talked earlier about up to 32 units, net of relos, we would expect 11 in Q1, three in Q2, seven in Q3, and 11 in Q4, Q4 being a little longer fiscal period 16 weeks versus 12 weeks than the others.","In fiscal 2015, I mentioned on a net basis, we had 23 units on a base of 653, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year assuming the 32 units on a base of 686, that would be just under 5% square footage growth. In terms of new locations by country, assuming that 30, 32 figure, about 18 in the U.S., Canada up three, two each in Japan and Australia, and one each in UK, Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, Spain and France.","As of fourth quarter end, total square footage stood at 98.7 million square feet. In terms of common stock repurchases buybacks, for the fourth quarter, we spent $260 million on 1.836 million shares, at an average price of just under $142. On an annualized basis, that would be about $850 million, as an annualized run rate during the quarter. For the year, we spent $484 million at an average price of $142.87.","In terms of dividends, our third quarterly dividend stands at $0.40 a share, or $1.60 a share annualized, that was up 12.5% from the prior quarterly rate that paid in the first two quarters of fiscal 2015. This year is $1.60 per share dividend, represents an annual cost to the company of about $700 million. And as you know, back in February, we did a special dividend of $5 per share, which was a total of $2.2 million special dividend paid out to shareholders.","Lastly, before I turn it over to Kayla for Q&A, our fiscal 2016 first quarter schedule earnings release date for the 12-week first quarter ending on November 22, would be after market close on Tuesday December 8, with the earnings call the following morning on the 9th of December.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for questions and turn it back to Kayla.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Charles Grom from Sterne, Agee Credit.","Charles Grom","Hey, good morning, Richard.","Richard Galanti","Hi.","Charles Grom","Just on the core margin performance in the quarter, I think you said, it was up 13 basis points. Could you delve into the performance by the four sub-categories? I know you said that food, hardlines and softlines were all up. Just curious, the \u2013 why the pressure on the fresh food side?","Richard Galanti","Well I think the pressure on the fresh food side is us. We \u2013 when you\u2019ve got some inflation on some of the commodity items like eggs, you\u2019ve got a \u2013 we\u2019re not changing the price of a 16 pack of muffins or a slice of pizza or hotdog.","So it has more to do with that and nothing really surprising there. If you look at each of those four categories, again overall, the gross margin as a percent of sale \u2013 their own sales year-over-year in the quarter was up 13. I think the range was in the low 20s on the high side and the mid-teens on that negative downside. So not \u2013 pretty much similar slightly above last year, no real big changes there.","Charles Grom","Okay. Good. And then when you look to next year, just kind of switching gears a little bit when you switched to Visa from AmEx, can you shape out for us how the switch is going to work and be handled, and what you\u2019re planning to do with the interchange savings that you\u2019re going to generate? And also just looking back, how you handled it in Canada and any surprises on that front?","Richard Galanti","No. I mean, things in Canada first of all went \u2013 have gone fine; a little different in Canada, because of certain Canadian issues. The portfolio was not purchased by the new issuer, so we had essentially you have people apply for it. That being said, they shop at Costco, they want that co-branded card, and it\u2019s just fine. You see a little bit of change in renewal rate when that happens, because of auto renewals. You\u2019ve got to re-sign people up and everything. But from an improvement in terms of additional moneys be it for us in terms of lower merchant fees, or our members in terms of a better rewards on the co-brand that\u2019s all that is planned.","In the U.S., we\u2019re working through everything right now. The plan is for, again, the current contract ends on March \u2013 at the end of March next year, that could be in and around the month or two from there. The two parties AmEx and Citi continue to work towards that end. And we will expect to tell you more when we can.","In terms of how it\u2019s going to be split between merchant fees and rewards, I think our \u2013 I think I have stated in the past, our philosophy is to, when we save money on product purchases, we want to give most of it back to the consumer to the customer. And we\u2019re looking at all kinds of opportunities to do that, so stay tuned.","Charles Grom","Okay, fair enough. And just last question, August comps were obviously pretty good. Just wondering, with September almost closed here, any surprises on September sales for you guys?","Richard Galanti","If I could tell you, I would. We\u2019ll wait until next week.","Charles Grom","All right. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Quick question, I think you telegraphed this on the sales side, Labor Day, realizing it was in September both years. But this year, the quarter may not have caught the \u2013 I guess, the lead-up to it. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a big deal from a sales or earnings perspective, just quickly on that.","Richard Galanti","More of just a sales perspective, given you\u2019re talking mid single, low single-digit numbers reported normalized and reported. We basically, in August, it was a \u2013 we feel a negative impact of about 1 percentage point. And there will be a corresponding improvement in September reported for the same reason, because of the \u2013 but four weeks versus five, so it\u2019s a little less of a positive, maybe 0.7% or 0.8% if our crystal ball is correct. So yes, the August numbers were impacted negatively a little and the September number will show little positive that we\u2019ll point that out in the release.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. And then the second question, on membership fees and potential increases. Just a question on the thought process, and I think in the past largely you\u2019ve done them to cover inflation. I\u2019m sure there has been inflation over the past five years in many areas. So can you talk about considerations and how you think about it? Are you surveying? Are you probing customers ahead of time to understand what\u2019s tolerable? And then taking into account that the landscape is evolving a little, you have some nontraditional online model, membership model. So how do you think about the right range to raise that?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think we\u2019ve done $6, $5 increases over roughly 30 years, generally about every five or so years. We don\u2019t do a lot of polling. We look at it internally \u2013 have we improved the value of that membership to our member. In terms of the tolerability of it to the member, I know, our historical five in the case of the executive member last time five years ago $10 increase is a heck of a lot less than we see in other types of fees out there, be it fees for television, or your phones, or other services out there. So I firstly don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to ever be an issue. When is \u2013 we really haven\u2019t talked about it a lot, it\u2019s something that we\u2019ll probably do at some point, but stay tuned.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Good morning, Richard. Wanted to just discuss assortment and fulfillment online, certainly across the industry, there has been a lot of competition and investments being made in fulfillment whether is Amazon or Jet.com, or some of the newer initiatives from Sam\u2019s Club. Could you just discuss some of your recent online sales trends and any updates that you could provide for us on upcoming enhancements around assortment or fulfillment online?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t think there\u2019s, I mean, in terms of \u2013 there are a few things I mentioned over the last few quarters on a topical basis, we certainly expanded to some extent the SKU selection and added what I would call more frequent \u2013 frequently purchased items, be it food and sundries or a few office needs everything from, again, sundry items to health and beauty aids, K-cups, few apparel items. And so we\u2019ve expanded that. We took certain key departments and brought them in line. So we are not competing with each other and providing, I think, little more excitement to that. We ship out of more than one depot. When we first started this for the first several years in the U.S., everything was shipped out of one depot in Southern California, which meant that, it might take a little longer to get to you and it cost us a little more in terms of delivery or the member.","And as we have expanded, we\u2019ve improved that quite a bit as well, quite a bit for us. And we\u2019re pleased with the fact that sales for the last, gosh, the last two, three years, at least, have been on a year-over-year comp basis around 20%. So, we\u2019re doing it methodically. We\u2019re not going to go crazy out there. I think our mobile apps have improved and will continue to improve. And we like the value proposition we have. We\u2019re recognizing that we can\u2019t be everything to everybody, that\u2019s not what we do for a living, and but we have great value. We also like the fact that some of these other services are buying from us. Some of our top customers are some of those guys. So if we can\u2019t deliver that single unit of milk or cereal to your doorstep, someone that is may want to buy from us.","Paul Trussell","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And you spoke about the impact to margins from an IT monetization standpoint. Could you just give us a little bit more detail about what some of the latest focus points have been in terms of system upgrade? And what we should be looking forward to you all tackling over the fiscal 2016 period?","Richard Galanti","Well, going back, again, three years ago, we embarked on a pretty significant effort to really upgrade and monetize all our systems. Our systems were for the most part legacy systems, many of them written in-house. Many of them what I\u2019ll say were band-aided over the years and worked fine, but were arguably strained. Some of the systems that were included in that, that were not legacy were from outside suppliers that were not going to be supported going forward or had not been supported. And so we probably started a little later than we should have a few years ago. And we \u2013 and as I indicated over the last each quarter frankly, what we try to do is just show you really what the expense associated with those incremental efforts are. We\u2019ve installed a new membership system little under a year ago, I think, we installed a new point-of-sale system which is another deliverable if you will. There is a lot of small deliverables that I won\u2019t go into. We\u2019ve got several more over that are heading into the expense side and should be forthcoming over the next year to two years.","The other thing I mentioned in terms of \u2013 I talk on the SG&A, on an incremental basis over the last few years, I think we\u2019re now up to something in the low teens, 12, 13 basis points, those twos, threes and fives that have added each year. And recognizing your denominator, your sales because our sales keep increasing, we\u2019re seeing all of the costs associated with it. I think we\u2019ll start to see benefits when we look out beyond 2016. Does it mean that this SG&A will not go up fewer basis points, we\u2019ll see, but we \u2013 there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sometimes it\u2019s long, some days it\u2019s a longer tunnel than others but we are starting to see some deliverables from it.","So it\u2019s not a lot I can tell you about where the benefits are, there are clearly some benefits that we\u2019re going to see on the transportation side and some of the ancillary businesses like travel and other things. But the big switch over will be when buyers are buying on a new system a year or so down the road as well as the benefits in the transportation and other. But we don\u2019t want to put any dollars or basis points on those improvements. We had to do this if we want to double our size over a 10 or so year period starting couple of years ago with these expenses because we had a lot of systems that were really strained and this is going to set us up for the years to come.","Paul Trussell","Much appreciated. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Oliver Chen from Cowen and Company.","Oliver Chen","Hi, thanks a lot. Good morning, Richard. Regarding a bigger picture question, I was curious about your thoughts on what really sets you apart from other internet pure plays in terms of your supply chain and vertical integration and kind of this buying scale you have there? And then also international is a nice piece of the business just as we look at our models and talk to those part of the story, which countries do you have the most opportunity to increase share your store base versus maximum potential? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Sure. In terms of e-commerce, first we definitely chose \u2013 for us, we have a lot more items. We have 8,000 or 10,000 or so instead of 3,700 in store. That\u2019s a nit compared to everybody else out there that has hundreds of thousands, if not millions of items. I think what separates us is we\u2019ve got certainly we and others will have great quality merchandise. We\u2019ve got the best pricing overall. We work on margins that are at\/or slightly below our reported total company margins but up there high singles, very low double digits. We will compare that to anybody out there. Again, we recognize we\u2019re not going to be selling single items to govern within an hour or four hours or overnight necessarily.","But in a methodical way we think we are doing just fine and we think we have additional opportunities. And as I mentioned earlier, we are selling to a lot of these other guys that are wanting to deliver in certain unique ways. There is room for all of us. We\u2019ve got to keep, it\u2019s a big play out there in terms of market share and we think that we\u2019ll be able to take our share of that. Some little departments you lose a little, others you make a little, certainly we want people to still come into our warehouses.","In terms of opportunities outside of \u2013 in terms of warehouse club growth opportunities, I think the first comment, for those of you on the call who have noticed for long time, the market potential keeps improving. I don\u2019t think we ever would have thought we had 60 or so locations in Canada, we never thought we\u2019d have more than 80, we now have more than that and we\u2019ll certainly be over 100 at some point in the next several years. In the U.S. we are expanding if you had asked me five years ago, when we are 80% U.S., 20% international, I would say five years hence or now it\u2019s probably 50\/50 and going further South in terms of the percentage of openings in the U.S. We keep finding more opportunities here, so that\u2019s good news.","In terms of our inventories, we think we\u2019ve certainly got a lot of potential in these three countries in Asia we are currently at. Bigger market of course is Japan, much bigger than Korea and Taiwan but we think we can go from the low-teens in each of Taiwan and Korea, double over the next 10 years but we\u2019ll see, so one at a time. Australia, we only have seven units in a country that\u2019s two-thirds or a little more of that population of Canada which has 80 or 90 and I\u2019m not suggesting we\u2019re going to have two-thirds of that anytime soon but we certainly can add a few there. Western Europe, we see \u2013 it\u2019s tough getting in with all the rules, regulations and permitting process but we are pretty interested to continue that process. Again, we\u2019ll open our second unit in Spain next month in Madrid and Getafe, a third unit \u2013 second in the Madrid area next calendar year and hopefully our first in France towards the end of the next fiscal year.","So we think there is plenty opportunities. I think we feel comfortable that over the next five years we will continue to open 30-ish plus units a year and that we thought we would do that this year that just ended certainly in the high 20s, a few of those got delayed and that\u2019s life but we\u2019ve got a pipeline that\u2019s full. The international generally takes a lot longer for variety of reasons by country. And \u2013 but so we think that we\u2019ll continue to grow and do just fine in terms of that.","Oliver Chen","Okay. And Richard, just a quick follow-up, there has been talk in terms of competitors in relation to how competitors are dealing with vendors. Could you just update us on your thoughts on your vendor relationships and any catalyst there given your buying scale and your leverage and your heritage, I was just curious on your thoughts. Thanks.","Richard Galanti","I\u2019d like to think that the comment that we share internally and we talk to you guys about is that we are tough but fair. We are tough. We fight for member everyday and we \u2013 I\u2019d like to think that we do that as much if not more than anybody else. The good news about us in terms of our view of competitiveness is as we give the vast majority of any improvement back to the member and that in our view creates that moat that hopefully continues to get bigger. One of the challenges and opportunities we have is the \u2013 just the share size of our needs of various commodities, organics not long-staple cotton you name it.","So we\u2019ve got a lot of efforts in that area that I think many of our competitors don\u2019t necessarily go to that level because they are dealing with vendors and lots of more items. And so I think we have some opportunities and challenges \u2013 but opportunities and challenges I think creates something special about us. I don\u2019t think anything is changed as we get bigger, we could be tougher but still fair and we work with our vendors. We think we have good relationships with them. We would assume that most of them would agree probably a few don\u2019t but we\u2019ll continue to be very transparent in how we deal with our vendors and we have very good relationships with many of them.","Oliver Chen","Best regards. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Binder from Jefferies.","Daniel Binder","Hi. Good morning. It\u2019s Dan Binder. My question had to do with ancillary margins, the last five quarters you\u2019ve had three quarters where ancillary margins were up about 15 basis points ex cash deflation and then two quarters where they were up substantially more than that. It happens to coincide with the declining gas prices and what I\u2019m trying to understand is how much of that gross margin improvement in ancillary is sustainable versus just being a function of the way gas was fluctuating during the quarter.","Richard Galanti","Well, gas for I think most of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis has helped a lot. But the other ancillary business continue to grow and whether it\u2019s optical or hearing aid or some of the other warehouse club businesses, all those things add up, travel you name it. So I think I hope it\u2019s sustainable, they are clearly gas \u2013 we have no illusion that some point in life gas prices go up and margin will be more normal relative to our history. Right now, it\u2019s good for our member in terms of low gas prices and good for us in terms of albeit a lower top line sales. It\u2019s been more profitable on a year-over-year basis.","Daniel Binder","Okay. Then the other item I wanted to talk about was other income which I realized as a function of these FX contracts you talked about earlier in the call, always a challenge to model. I\u2019m just curious if FX rates were to stay roughly where they are today, how do you think that line item would look in Q1?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know. All I can tell you is that, we look at it \u2013 we manage it in the sense that if you go to foreign country where some of their inventory purchases are paid for in dollars or euro sometimes but U.S. dollars is the bigger example, they will do \u2013 once they are comfortable with a price point that they\u2019re going to be able to convert at that level and sell goods in their local currency in their local country, they\u2019re going to choose to figure out how much of that they\u2019re going to lock in. Recognizing lock in just makes the control that price. If the local currency continues to weaken, that was good. If local currency strengthens relative to the U.S. dollar, they don\u2019t as much but we don\u2019t try to be completely writing away.","So I think over the years in the last four or five years, that\u2019s a number that is probably ranged from plus or minus $15 million pretax, usually a little less than the number that we had this period where it\u2019s up about $15 million or so. But I would say it\u2019s \u2013 we just want to point it out because it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s going to be income statement. It\u2019s very hard to predict, I think by doing the way we do it, we\u2019re not going to ever have any giant surprise either way because of some drastic change in FX prices.","Daniel Binder","And then the last item to share, repurchase picked up a bit this quarter, how you\u2019re thinking about it for this coming year?","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019ll tell you each quarter it\u2019s part of our \u2013 what we do with our cash. As long as we feel good about our future, we\u2019re not going to ever be \u2013 we\u2019re going to buy on a regular basis, not try to take the market. I think the fact that we bought a little more this quarter as they start to come down a little bit but as I\u2019ve said in the past we buy a little more when it goes down and but we \u2013 I certainly feel comfortable about our future prospects as a company. So don\u2019t expect giant changes and how we\u2019ve been in the past. Certainly we trend in each quarter this year on an annualized basis upward and we are certainly comfortable at the current level.","Daniel Binder","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","So, Richard, if you look at the three categories, the three broad departments, we saw some margin improvement. So two things, was there any common themes there in terms of maybe COGS doing a better job on your cost or KS mix, so any commonality there? And then if we kind of reached a point here because I assume the KS mix will continue to get better and how you buy that will continue to get better where there should be an upward drift in growth just secularly because there will be the elasticity of what you would choose to invest in, those merit right putting all of that back into the market price wise.","Richard Galanti","I\u2019d like to think that we were that smart. Overall, we try to improve margins a little by lowering prices and I mean that sincerely and we\u2019re going to give most of that back to the customer to our member. As you know, we are pretty stubborn and intent on maintaining in a rising commodity standpoint prices on certain fresh food so we\u2019ve seen some impact there to the negative. I think you\u2019re right though as we continue to improve increased penetration of KS, that helps a little.","Certainly as we\u2019ve had relative strength in departments over the last couple of years like Softlines and domestics and elsewhere in some of those items, we\u2019re going to improve that a little bit and that\u2019s of course outside of the ancillary and other businesses which in some cases were from higher margins as a starting point be it pharmacy or hearing aid center or optometry or whatever else. So but organics helps in a smaller way I mentioned in the past, not only organics relative to their substitute, the non-organic same products, organics sell at a higher price point but our view is that others while it may be competitive, we actually can be \u2013 we feel a more competitive framework and a little bit higher margin than on the underlying non-organic item.","So it\u2019s really in our view a win-win for us challenge being getting more organic and that\u2019s not a challenge, that\u2019s challenge for us, of course, it\u2019s a challenge for everybody out there. So all those things help. I don\u2019t think we started the fiscal quarter and said let\u2019s see how we get an extra 10 or 15 or 20 basis points higher in a year-over-year. But we\u2019ll always try to improve a little as we know we have challenges elsewhere.","John Heinbockel","And do you think and at least I\u2019ve noticed this particularly I think more in softlines, but do you think the quality of KS, it seems to continue to get better maybe at a faster pace even then it has in the recent past.","Do you think that\u2019s fair, but the quality is getting better that\u2019s the investment not price point so much?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think two things like on the softline side like apparel and everything we\u2019ve over the last year as we\u2019ve made a bigger effort in that area we took what sometimes would be a retail branded item at $200 or $300 for pair of slacks, that were $49.99, but when you go out by the same fabric and they could hopefully a very good quality item.","And commit to a half a million or million units or so I think that helps. So we\u2019re always pushing the quality and the quantity and buying power of that and that quality value relationship continues to I think improve.","John Heinbockel","Okay and then just lastly I don\u2019t think you guys have done a whole lot of data mining right with your membership base. Do you see that and does IT modernization allow you to do that.","And then I\u2019m wondering when you think about sales sort of comp sales by comparable member I\u2019m just curious when you look going forward. Do you guys see a bigger opportunity to get and I\u2019m not saying the most loyal members maybe somebody a little bit below the top.","To come in more frequently and that\u2019s a fresh food driver or more of an opportunity to get product and more items in the basket per trip. When you think about sustainability of comps by somebody\u2019s been member for well over three, five six years when do you see the bigger opportunity?","Richard Galanti","Well, first and foremost we\u2019ve learned from doing virtually nothing to be a little more over minded about it I think there\u2019s a lot of low hanging fruit that we haven\u2019t done certainly there\u2019s more efforts in these areas in our membership marketing team on dotcom a little bit.","But we don\u2019t do a lot with it, but we\u2019re doing a little more than we use to we must get I must get a call a week from some analytics company that wants to film stuff to do AB testing left or ketchup left or right of the mustard.","We done I think a better job on our multi-vendor mailer in terms of that, but we have I think we have more opportunities that we\u2019ve even touched the surface on. But I\u2019m not suggesting that\u2019s going to be tomorrow afternoon.","Marketing is definitely been told to try some new things and we haven\u2019t they generally work I do that more as something if things start to slow a little bit we have some opportunities there.","But our first and foremost focus on just constantly driving quality and value on the products and services we sell. And that\u2019s we seem to have not figured out where the bottom of that is.","John Heinbockel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Drbul from Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul","Hi Richard good morning. I guess just have a couple of questions I think last quarter you had quantified the impact on the gas profit I think you said it benefit by a penny I was wondering if you could give us that same metric this quarter.","And the second question I have is I think was some of the remodels that are going on. Could you just talk a little bit about category focus in the remodels and your expectation on what the returns in the comp uplifts we might see?","Richard Galanti","Yep what was the first question I lost it.","Bob Drbul","Gas profit\u2026","Richard Galanti","I think last quarter there was not a big impact it is a wash year-over-year it\u2019s more than a few cents, but not a heck of a lot we really don\u2019t talk about other than directionally, which way it helped us.","Certainly I think four at least four of the last five fiscal quarters on a year-over-year basis it\u2019s been up, and more outsized the normal up. And the second question.","Bob Drbul","Remodels, trend in remodels what would be the expectation that you see category focuses and how that might impact comp store sales as we sort of go through this?","Richard Galanti","Sure, and keep in mind remodels I think of traditional retail stores remodeled they\u2019re doing a whole new front and new flooring and, new lighting fixtures I mean a lot of our remodels or everything.","And we spend a lot of money on increasing refrigeration and frozen and in the fresh foods area that\u2019s to use as somebody mentioned earlier that\u2019s to use to be a driver of our business and certainly something we\u2019re pretty good at.","We constantly try to figure out what locations that we don\u2019t have where we can put gas stations although we\u2019ve we\u2019re saturating that. There\u2019s certainly existing locations that are never going to have a gas station.","But we still have a few out there and we\u2019re of course so that it\u2019s gas stations in the few other countries beyond just the US and Canada so there\u2019s little things like that. There\u2019s typically half a dozen or so units here where we\u2019re breaking out a wall buying some extra land perhaps.","Adding 10 or 20,000 feet where it make sense and many times it make sense economically when there\u2019s some government incentives on solar that small dollar wise, but I\u2019m just coming out with some examples.","So remodeling for us is just roughly sometimes improving and updating something, but lot of times just adding some more stuff, more feet of refrigeration is something that comes to mind in a bigger way over the last few years.","Bob Drbul","And then just one question on the ancillary businesses. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening in the photo business and trends in the quarter and sort of what the expectations are there?","Richard Galanti","Well look you probably have our processing less photos than it use to it\u2019s actually about the businesses so profitability rises about flat year-over-year actual photos process is down.","We\u2019ve and half of the business on a few other things with where everything from can this pictures to photo books to three four cartridges total cartridges and, but it\u2019s that\u2019s it\u2019s not a business that\u2019s going to come back tomorrow either.","Of all the ancillary business is that one that it\u2019s big it\u2019s profitable it\u2019s not as profitable as it used to be, but it\u2019s and we\u2019ll continue to look in that space and see what we want to do.","But we still have it and still we still try to figure out how to improve it.","Bob Drbul","Thank you Richard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays.","Meredith Adler","Hey Richard this is Meredith Adler. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about kind of what happened with the store openings this year, which I think met -- mixed your expectations I know some slipped into next year.","But were there any common theme in that and when you look out the sort of nice number of openings from next year. Do you think that there\u2019s any risk based on what happened in fiscal 2015?","Richard Galanti","Sure, there\u2019s always be risk I think prior to the fiscal 2015 for the few years leading up to that we actually got better on track of getting close to what we think is going to actually open.","We put this is our original budget everything that if everything generally goes right. And we\u2019ve already and it\u2019s been green inked if you will it\u2019s been approved internally based on whatever permits and zoning issues and whatever all the issues are out there.","We think we have it a decent chance of opening it we\u2019re going to put it in there recognizing inevitably there\u2019s always five or eight of those units that are budgeted four months 11 and 12 if not a few more that fiscal year maybe 10 units a year in that last month or two.","And inevitably few of those fall out I think that we\u2019ll get closer than we did this year relative to our budget. Generally speaking it\u2019s not because we decided not to do a unit that we were going to do it.","The only time that happens or virtually every time that happens is something, because something was became a big surprise and doing additional drilling we found something on the site that was a bigger issue.","And that\u2019s by the way is generally not a risk, because when we do a site it\u2019s for virtually all of them nearly all of them we have to feel comfortable that we will be able to do it before we commit to it.","Meredith Adler","Okay, so there wasn\u2019t any.","Richard Galanti","I think we get closer.","Meredith Adler","And there wasn\u2019t any common theme to the ones that didn\u2019t open this year or got delayed?","Richard Galanti","No it\u2019s everyone\u2019s unique story, but it\u2019s just typical delays weather, zoning, other surprises that are unrelated to competition or anything else out there.","Meredith Adler","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Good morning thanks for taking my question. Can you give me more detail on the traffic trends on not only this quarter, but over the last few years. Are you seeing more of the growth comes from the middle of year of the membership base.","Presumably the most frequent members are tapped out they can no long \u2013 they cannot grow the number of times they\u2019re going to Costco. So then most are coming from the mid tier berth of the membership population or is it more like the least attached members are getting a little bit more attached?","Richard Galanti","Maybe people our membership and operations know little more than I do here I \u2013 and maybe there\u2019s some more opportunity. Overall overtime shops go up as people are making more each year as they\u2019re having family whatever those issues are.","And so certainly an older member in terms how long they\u2019ve been a member and that increase several time. But it\u2019s a lot of things it\u2019s the merchandising, it\u2019s the frequency drivers like fresh foods or gas, it\u2019s that incremental shop, because somebody always that needs a maintenance prescription.","They got to the age where they\u2019re going to come in a one extra time a year, because of their timing of their need for a cholesterol reducing drug or whatever. So it\u2019s a lot of little things plus a few of those things notable things like fresh foods and gas.","It\u2019s also executive membership, it\u2019s also the co-branded card and rewards and it really is all of the above I don\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s different reasons clearly when we have new members whether it\u2019s was new millennial members or 20 years ago new gen whatever members.","They buy less when they start they buy more over time I can\u2019t tell you what millennials are going to do relative to their predecessor age groups overall not just a Costco, but overall buying.","If they have smaller houses and they drive a little less and they buy fewer sofas, that is that is not good for anybody, but at the end of the day we think we\u2019re getting our share.","Michael Lasser","Okay, and my follow-up question is how do you notice or how do you observe your membership population responded to different types of promotions. And when I say promotions I\u2019m talking about pricing expense rewards through your card maybe the new merchandise offers.","And can you give us what\u2019s being most say what\u2019s been most impactful and how is how the response is into drive up back it hasn\u2019t been to allowed you to side out more members. Thank you so much.","Richard Galanti","Well first of all we\u2019re not going to share all the specifics, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a little bit of all of the above. We work every day to try to improve the value proposition to the member.","We work every day to try to upsize and either where it make sense, because we do lot more things and more dollars in that basket. We maybe something like the multi-vendor mailer with the couponing that grew dramatically from what was originally a six or eight week summer item summer couponing booklet to 11 or so times a year for three plus weeks each.","And over time we and our vendors figure out what works best and what starts to slow down. So those things keep getting tweaked. So again there\u2019s we focus on trying to improve the value we if we can get if we can sell you a bigger pack size of the greater value we\u2019re going to do that I think that\u2019s a catch too.","We don\u2019t just want to increase the size of something 50% and sell off at the same price per ounce or price per number of units. We only want to raise it for the most probably we try to raise and only the quantity or the quantity when we feel lower the price per unit to the member and that\u2019s serves us well and serves them well. So it\u2019s that\u2019s our religion.","Michael Lasser","Sure I\u2019m thinking more about the card does that have as much influence in the members purchase decision or frequency as pricing or coupons for example?","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t know one has more or the other we know that the executive members shop a lot take a through \u2013 take a group of 100,000 members out of are similar in terms of shopping patterns and age groups, and 10 year as a member. And they\u2019re both growing those both of those groups are growing roughly the same rate each year.","Get half of the convert to a executive member and you see a dramatic change in their buying habits, but that\u2019s no change that we have seen over the years that I think that surprises me personally is the continued penetration of that area.","And maybe we\u2019ve got little better in store of doing that clearly loyalty programs worth whether it\u2019s our executive member program or a reward based program credit card. And one of the things that\u2019s long-term exciting for us is.","We feel that we can continue even on our co-brand card, continue to improve the value proposition to our member, which hopefully gets them in here more often. But that\u2019s what we do every day.","Michael Lasser","Sure. All right good luck with the upcoming year. Thank you so much.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict","Hey Richard, thanks for taking my question. A couple here. First of all, can you talk about the new member signup trends in the fourth quarter I didn\u2019t hear if you did mention that I apologize I know they were down slightly in the third quarter?","Richard Galanti","They\u2019re actually up in the fourth quarter year-over-year a combination of decent member signups and the existing warehouses probably a few more international units in the quarter on a comparable year-over-year basis in the quarter.","I think we\u2019re up a little over 2 million members in the quarter from the area in terms of new signups.","Peter Benedict","Okay, great and then I mean you mentioned when you gave the regional color you said that Texas was good. But can you talk about maybe chance in some of the specific energy markets again like Houston maybe somewhere it\u2019s up in Alberta like and you\u2019ve seen any kind of moderation in traffic or ticket or what have you?","Richard Galanti","I just don\u2019t have that amount of granularity in front of me.","Peter Benedict","Okay and then the thought process behind repatriated cash from Canada why now and then you\u2019ve got $1.2 billion that comes during December any thoughts here to refinance that or payoff?","Richard Galanti","At this point we\u2019ll probably pay it off point of the repatriation is Canada is a very profitable country so it\u2019s we\u2019ve built up cash balances at some point we determined on an ongoing basis we will determine whether we feel this to be permanently invested up there or not.","And at such time we\u2019ll make that decision I think we\u2019ve done that twice. About a year ago we\u2019ve brought back a little over billion dollars. And in this case it was favorable from us a small favorable from a tax perspective.","A year ago I think third to fourth quarter a year ago it was slightly unfavorable, but again we determined but small. We determined it was the right time to bring it back from a reinvestment standpoint.","Peter Benedict","Okay fair enough and last question just on CapEx $2.8 billion or $3 billion this year from a double you did maybe a few years ago I understand you\u2019ve got some of the investment you\u2019re doing the higher store growth.","Is that a level you think is one that we should assume hold for several years assuming you can open 30 plus stores per year or are some of the investments you\u2019re doing in IT and systems and distribution to those kind of taper off a bit maybe in the years to how you\u2019re thinking about that?","Richard Galanti","I hope IT tapers of a little, but it\u2019s that\u2019s not the biggest piece of it. I think and certainly couple of those things it\u2019s going to be the $2.5 to $3 range as that $2.8 to $3.0 this year a $102 that likely to be $102 higher than the following year maybe I don\u2019t see that $2.8 to $3 going to $3.5 next year.","So yeah something of the high 2s is probably a good guess through for next years.","Peter Benedict","Yeah, okay that make sense thank you.","Richard Galanti","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","Hey thanks for taking the question actually had some follow-ups and some of the questions were already been asked, but I want to get some clarity. So I think the Michael Lasser, was asking about the Visa card and I guess real specifically do you anticipate that card will actually drive membership growth Richard?","Richard Galanti","Well we get there we\u2019ll let you know.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, okay and then following up a little bit on John Heinbockel and his kind of the technology. When you\u2019re looking at your executive members do you guys have clarity to the data say okay how many are these executive members using our ancillary services what are they using and kind of what the penetration rates are?","Richard Galanti","Yes absolutely, but we\u2019re not going to share with you what those are. Each ancillary business is a little different, some of them take a decade to really get some good footing. But they are all great values and yet another reason why somebody wants to be a member and we\u2019ll keep improving those values. So those are \u2013 whether it\u2019s KS, or organic, or commodities, or these items, these are all things I think that gives us a good competitive position.","Scott Mushkin","And do you think there\u2019s an opportunity to drive additional ancillary business growth with your core members?","Richard Galanti","Absolutely.","Scott Mushkin","Okay, then\u2026","Richard Galanti","I would recommend that you try Costco Travel, you\u2019ll be amazed.","Scott Mushkin","I\u2019m working right now at a Costco car buying program, so I hear that\u2019s wonderful as well.","Richard Galanti","As well, I think, we\u2019re approaching 0.5 million car \u2013 new cars a year on that. And there\u2019s a reason, we use our buying power to get our members a great savings on cars.","Scott Mushkin","And when you think about getting a little bit more involved in technology and relationship with your customers is one area that you think could be a level that could be thrown?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m sorry, say that again?","Scott Mushkin","When you\u2019re looking at data mining, knowing your customers a little bit better, marketing a little bit more aggressively, I think, you mentioned at the beginning as a scenario that would get a focus do you think?","Richard Galanti","At some point, we kind of little self deprecating when we talk about that. At the end of the day, there\u2019s a lot of opportunities to do a lot of that stuff. We kind of look at it in the 80-20 rule, we\u2019re doing a little of it, which you\u2019re getting some benefits. There will be plenty of opportunities to do some of that in the future. But we \u2013 our main focus is on driving value and a lot of those other things take care of themselves. And certainly Craig Jelinek as our CEO has told people, an e-commerce people and membership marketing, try some things and they\u2019re trying some things, and we\u2019ll keep go in that direction.","Scott Mushkin","Perfect. And I had just one last kind of follow-up, this is when Bob was talking about the remodels, I\u2019m trying to understand that our local Costco is under remodel in the fresh department. And as you look at 2016 and 2017, is that the focus of the remodels, are you expecting to do more of them, and it\u2019s just focused on fresh, it seem like that\u2019s where the focus. I just wanted to get clarity and is it going up kind of year-over-year?","Richard Galanti","I think as a general rule, it has been going up. But it\u2019s up, it\u2019s a big number. And I don\u2019t know if it keeps going up from there. I know the one across the street here, we again added 10,000 feet or 15,000 feet. We expanded greatly the walk-in coolers for customers and produce and dairy. When you\u2019re doing in some of these units $200 million, $250 million, $300 million, you can drive some true incremental good sales by not only expanding the \u2013 everything in terms of the traffic patterns ingress in and outside of the warehouse. But adding some of these things like refrigeration, fresh foods, and they\u2019ll still continue to be a big number.","Scott Mushkin","And so you\u2019re doing more fresh remodels, fresh drives traffic, is the focus in that fresh area on organic, or just general, or is it related towards organics?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think in terms of CapEx related, it\u2019s everything. Our organics is just a piece of that.","Scott Mushkin","All right. Perfect. Thank you so much. Really enjoyed the answers. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greg Melich from Evercore ISI.","Greg Melich","Hi, thanks. Gone over an hour, and I still have a couple of questions. So, one of the follow-up on gas, what was the average gas price in the quarter versus last and if you could give us the gallon as well, that would be great?","Richard Galanti","The average price in Q4 was 365 a year ago and 288 this current fourth quarter, so down 21.2%.","Greg Melich","Right. And if that\u2019s the case, I guess, going back to gas profitably understanding it\u2019s been a tailwind. I guess, is that incremental drop even from last quarter that\u2019s really allowed the profitability to boost up again. Is that \u2013 are we thinking about that right?","Richard Galanti","Actually the price was \u2013 from a quarter ago, the price was up about $0.20 a gallon. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think, there\u2019s a little bit of new normal, it\u2019s not just how it is year-over-year, it\u2019s when it\u2019s low, it\u2019s better from a profitability standpoint, and it\u2019s relative to competition. I mean, gas buddy has continued to say that we\u2019re the lowest price out there nationally, and I think we\u2019re still pretty good at being very competitive that we get a lot of good kudos for that.","Greg Melich","So basically you can keep your competitive advantage, but the penny profit might be better than it used to be the way the market is?","Richard Galanti","Yes. I think in \u2013 when prices are low, we make more than we used on average per gallon or per gas station, and that\u2019s good.","Greg Melich","Right. And then the second question was going back to membership fee income, I think, you said it was 6% if we exclude FX?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Greg Melich","I believe that\u2019s a 100 or maybe 200 bps below the trend in the last year or two. Is that just fewer openings last year, or I think last quarter you mentioned sign-ups per club was actually negative, but it was a comparison issue, just help us understand how that\u2026?","Richard Galanti","I think, overall it\u2019s just fine. There is a little bit in Canada of the auto renewal issue when we switch over and we\u2019ll see that again a year hence over the next year, starting next year, that\u2019s a small piece of it. I don\u2019t think beyond that there\u2019s a whole lot there in that regard. There\u2019s always going to be the timing, because when membership fee dollar increases, we use deferred accounting for it. And so that makes it a little more squishy number, but overall the number was in line with what we felt was pretty good.","Greg Melich","And with the auto renewal effect, I guess, I\u2019ll sneak a third one in. If I remember correctly, AmEx is roughly 40% of the tender in the stores. So to think of the magnitude that have in Canada when you did the changeover, what was AmEx\u2026?","Richard Galanti","Well, there\u2019s one big difference in Canada, the portfolio was not purchased. While I can\u2019t guarantee, it will be purchased, the contract states it should be, and we\u2019ll keep towards that, our Citi and AmEx are working towards that end. That\u2019s a different scenario in terms of auto renewal. Up there, you basically have to re-sign people up, they have to apply for credit. They get their \u2013 they get authorized. They have to re-sign up for auto renewal. I don\u2019t expect that to be an issue in the U.S.","Greg Melich","Got it. And the tender there is roughly the same as here at 40%?","Richard Galanti","I think it was a little less, but remind you the market share of our provider up there historically had a lower market share there relative to Canada than they do in the U.S., have a stronger market share down here.","Greg Melich","Okay, got it. Great. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Yes. Why don\u2019t we take one more question?","Operator","Our final question comes from Matthew Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much for keeping the flame burning just for another moment. First question relates to Spain and just curious on your learnings from your first Spain opening and how you expect your continental European stores to differ from your other international markets based on what you saw from that first unit?","Richard Galanti","Well, like any first unit with maybe the exception of Australia, which was off the charts high to start with, you learn a lot. You learn what sells and doesn\u2019t sell. I think, if I recall from when we first opened in Saville year-and-half, two years ago. We had a less \u2013 we had stronger non-food than we would have expected and not as strong fresh food. Usually in a few market you got stronger fresh food. This given us great success in countries like Korea and Taiwan and Japan. We have to remind ourselves that Korea and Taiwan, they were not very good for several years. You start off with slower sales in most countries other than Australia and when you first entered \u2013 when we first entered the market, and that was consistent, probably the worst economy we started was in Spain, but we\u2019re seeing some traction.","Membership sign-ups are just fine, and membership renewals have been just fine. But it\u2019s \u2013 one data point does not a story make here. Madrid is certainly is a much bigger market than Saville, and we\u2019ve got again one unit coming next month and a second one in around Madrid coming, I believe next spring, certainly, sometime in the mid of the calendar year. So that will be more telling in our view than anything we\u2019ve seen so far.","Matthew Fassler","Great.","Richard Galanti","We continue to be very confident that we got a good model that works, and we\u2019re patient as well.","Matthew Fassler","A quick second question. On the online and e-commerce piece, Instacart, I know, is a particularly prominent partnership among the ones that you\u2019ve got, and it\u2019s a concept that from a \u2013 in terms of the number of retailers who is doing business with and how long that\u2019s hung in, seems to be gaining some traction. Any sense as to how that relationship has evolved, in particular, how the economics look for you relative to some of the alternatives?","Richard Galanti","Well, again, we\u2019re not going to disclose any specifics, we have a good working relationship with Instacart with \u2013 certainly with Google Shopping Express as well, and Instacart is in more cities, and anybody you know out there that wants to buy from us, you call us.","Matthew Fassler","Fair enough. And then finally, I think Greg \u2013 one element of Greg\u2019s questions might not have gotten answered was gallon comps. You talked a bit about the gas prices. But I remember, when gas prices first started coming under pressure, gallon comps surged into double digits, are you still seeing that with that prices down here today?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s double-digits, but it\u2019s certainly positive.","Matthew Fassler","Got it, okay.","Richard Galanti","And we generally have that out sometimes in a moment of weakness I share it with you guys. But the comps have continued to go in the right direction in terms of gallon.","Matthew Fassler","Thank you so much.","Richard Galanti","Okay. Thank you, everyone. Have a good day."],"5972":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q4 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call October  8, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Peter Benedict - Robert Baird","Mike Otway - Wolfe Research","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","David Schick - Stifel","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Operator","Good morning.

This morning we reported our 16-week fourth quarter and 52-week fiscal year 2014 operating results, both which ended on August 31. These results are compared to the similar 16-week and 52-week periods in the prior fiscal year \u201913, which ended last year on September 1. In addition, we are reporting this morning our September sales results for the five weeks ended this past Sunday, October 5.","I will start by stating that the discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, our fourth quarter earnings results, for the 16-week fourth quarter, earnings came in at $1.58 a share, up $0.18 or up 13% from last year\u2019s fourth quarter earnings of $1.40.","In terms of sales for the fourth quarter, total sales were up 9%, comp sales were up 6% on a reported basis, and excluding gas and FX impacts were up 7%. For the quarter, gas prices year-over-year were essentially flat, so no impact on the 6% U.S. comp figure.","However, foreign currencies overall weakened relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter with biggest impact in Canada. Such that our reported 6% international comp figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been up 8%.","In terms of sales for the five-week September period, total sales increased 7% year-over-year and reported comp sales increased 4%, and again excluding both gas and FX impacts comp sales would have been up 6%.","In terms of comparing our $1.58 earnings figure for the fourth quarter this fiscal year to last year\u2019s fourth quarter of $1.40, there are five items I\u2019d like to point out. First, FX, in the fourth quarter year-over-year currencies in the foreign countries where we operate on an overall basis weakened versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in our reported foreign earnings in Q4, when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $14 million pretax or $0.02 a share than these earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year.","Second point, LIFO, last year in the quarter we recorded an $8 million pretax LIFO credit or picked up of little over $0.01 a share. This year in the fourth quarter we have LIFO charge of almost $11 million or about $0.02 a share charge.","Third point, income taxes, our income taxes this year in Q4 included several discrete items that in the aggregate increased our income tax line by about $8 million. The $8 million of additional taxes included a few positive items that benefited or lowered our taxes by about $7 million in total.","However, these positive items in total were more than offset by a $15 million income tax charge related to our decisions to repatriate from Canada back to United States about US$1.2 billion or CAD$1.3 million or Canadian cash -- operations cash balances in the near future. In all, the $8 million net income tax increase from these discrete items, a negative impact to earnings of about $0.02 a share.","Fourth item, our company bonus accrual, I discussed in last year\u2019s earnings call that our fourth quarter 2013 quarter results benefited by reversing or bringing back a portion of the company\u2019s bonus accrual, as our fiscal \u201813 results caused us to pay bonuses at a lower level than we had accrued throughout the year.","This year in the fourth quarter our accrual for the year end bonuses was not reduced in the fourth quarter as it was -- as it had been last year. Overall, this represented a $0.04 a share negative swing year-over-year to our bottom line. Remind you that the bonus program impacts a little more than 4,000 people who participated in throughout the company.","And last item I will point out is gas profits, this year our gas profits in Q4 were quite strong representing an additional $0.05 a share to earnings year-over-year. Overall, $1.58 earnings figure for the years fourth quarter was reached by several discrete items representing $0.05 or $0.06 a share in the aggregate that did not go our way.","Now to the subject to new openings, for all of fiscal \u201814 we opened 30 new locations, 17 new in the U.S., three each in Canada and Australia, two each in Japan and Korea, and one each in the U.K., Mexico and Spain, that being our first unit opening in Spain.","We ended fiscal \u201814 with 663 locations operating worldwide. For the current fiscal year fiscal \u201915, our plans are to open 31 new warehouses and also relocate four existing locations, 19 of the planned 31 new locations will be in the United States, with remaining in international markets.","Inevitably, up to a few of these will get delayed. So I\u2019d estimate that the number of new units in fiscal \u201815 will most likely be either in a very high 20s or up to 30, plus the four relos.","During the first four months of fiscal 2015 basically September through this coming calendar year-end, we planned to open eight of our fiscal \u201815 locations, six in the U.S. and one each in Australia and Mexico, as well we will complete one warehouse relo in Wayne, New Jersey. This will occur in two weeks from tomorrow on the 23rd.","This morning I will also review with you our membership trends and other activities, our e-commerce activities, additional discussion about margins and SG&A, our stock repurchase activities during the quarter. I will also comment on the recent switch in Canada of our co-branded credit card offering that\u2019s going on right now.","Okay, for the fourth quarter results, sales again, for the 16-week fourth quarter were up 9% to $34.8 billion, up $3 billion from $31.8 billion a year ago in the fourth quarter. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comp sales were up 6%. For the quarter our 6% reported comp was a combination of an average transaction increase of a little under 2% for the quarter and this included FX detriment about a 0.5% and average frequency increase of 4.2%.","In terms of sales comparisons by geographic region, in the U.S. with the 6% fourth quarter comp overall, most U.S. regions registered in the mid single-digit comp increases with Midwest and Southeast being even stronger.","Internationally, within the plus 8% local currency comp, Australia and Japan were the weakest, do in large part cannibalization with Taiwan, Korea, Canada and Mexico all coming in strong in terms of comp sales increases.","In terms of comp sales by merchandised categories for the quarter, both food and sundries and hardlines comps were both in the mid-single digits range for the quarter, and both softlines and fresh foods comps were in the high-single digits range for the fourth quarter. Within fresh foods, of course, we are still experiencing inflation in the low to mid single-digit range on average.","For our September sales results, sales for the five-week September month, which ended October 5th were $10.57 billion, up 7% from last year\u2019s September reporting period. Again, on a comp basis, reported plus 4%.","For September, our plus 4% reported comp sales results were a combination of a slightly positive average transaction, notwithstanding, almost 2 percentage points impact from FX and gas deflation, and average frequency increase of right at 4%.","Cannibalization for the month negatively impacted our sales by just under 0.5 percentage point. Excluding FX and gas effects, comp sales for the month of September as I mentioned were up 6%.","In terms of sales by geographic region, most U.S. regions were in the 4% to 5% comp sales range with Midwest and Southeast being even stronger. Internationally in local currencies, Japan and Australia being impacted by cannibalization were the weakest performers, while Canada and Taiwan were the strongest in terms of comp sales increases.","In terms of sales by category for the September, our food and sundries and softlines both enjoyed mid single-digit comps, hardlines low single-digit comps and fresh foods high single-digit comps, again having a little bit of extra inflation there as well.","In ancillary business comps, overall, in the mid-single digits led by optical and food courts. Our gas comps were in the mid single-digit range, despite average sale price of gasoline during the month being down 4 percentage points year-over-year.","Moving to the line items in the fourth quarter income statement. Membership fees, we came in at $768 million or 2.21% of sales, that's up 7% or $52 million year-over-year from $716. It\u2019s down 4 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, we had strong sales in the quarter.","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates coming -- rounding up to 91% in the U.S. and Canada, and little over 87% worldwide. We continue to enjoy strength in our Executive member program with continued new signups.","New member signups in Q4 overall little over 2 million new signups in the company. This was about a 7% increase year-over-year. This was helped, of course, by strong new signups and a few overseas openings in Australia, Korea and Spain over the past year.","In terms of members -- number of members at Q4 end, our last reported number, of course, was fiscal quarter ago in mid-May. We had Gold Star members at the end of Q3 at 30.6 million, at the end of the fiscal year it was up 1 million to 31.6 million. Primary business was up 100,000 from 6.8 million to 6.9 million, add-ons remains at 3.5 million.","So, overall, total paid member households 40.9 million at Q3 end and up 1.1 million to 42 million even at Q4 end. I would -- excluding extra cards 74.6 million at Q3 end, up 1.8 million to 76.4 million at the end of the fiscal year.","Also at the end of the fiscal year, Executive membership's stood at just under 15 million, an increase of about 450,000 just in the 16-week quarter or about 28,000 increase per week of new Executive members.","In terms of membership renewal rates, they too continue strong. Again at the end of the third quarter, business renewal rates were 94.4%. They remained there at Q4 end. Gold Star renewal rates ticked up a little bit from 89.7% to 89.8%. Overall, we remained at 90.6%, rounding up to 91%. Again worldwide, we continued at 87.3%.","Now as I\u2019ve touched on the last couple of quarters\u2019 conference calls, we continue to try a few new things to drive both sales and new member signups. In early September, this would be the first couple weeks of the first quarter of the new fiscal year. For eight days, we ran a nationwide membership promotion for new members on Living Social with the purchase of a full price $55 membership. The new member received a $20 Costco Cash card, coupons for three free items.","As you might expect, they include a Kirkland Signature bath tissue, an apple pie, and rotisserie chicken, also a free three month membership for identity protection and a bonus coupon of $25 off of any Costco.com offer purchase of $250 or more. These types of promotions we believe will allow us to get in front of the other demographics and with an appealing offer. This one worked well and we\u2019ll keep you posted.","Lastly, I want to mention that in Canada, it was announced last week that the Costco Canada\u2019s co-branded critical offering is being switched from a Costco American Express co-branded card to a new co-branded Costco Capital One Platinum MasterCard. This will be exclusive to Costco members. We've already begun to issue the new MasterCards and we will continue to accept all AmEx cards through December 31st of this year.","Our new no-annual-fee credit card doubles as the membership card and allows our members to earn cash rewards on all purchases made both inside and outside the Costco with no cap on the amount of rewards that can be earned. Getting back to the income statement, our gross margin in the fourth quarter was quite strong coming in up 15 basis points year-over-year from 10.55% year ago in the fourth to 10.70% during the fourth quarter of this last fiscal year.","As usual, I\u2019ll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We\u2019ll do four columns. This time the four columns -- the first two columns be for Q4 \u201814 both as reported and without gas inflation and then for the entire fiscal year \u201814 reported and without gas inflation or deflation.","First line item is core merchandise. In the fourth quarter, we have a year-over-year, core was up six basis points both with and without gas because gas year-over-year was essentially flat. For the year, plus 6 reported and a plus 3 without gas. Ancillary and other businesses, a big contributor in Q4 plus 15 basis points in the first two columns there and for the year plus 6 and plus 6.","The 2% reward no impact in the Q4 both in those two columns, a minus 1 basis point impact in the next two columns. LIFO, as I mentioned, of course, there was a charge this year versus a credit last year, 6 basis points year-over-year both in the fourth-quarter columns and minus 5 basis points year-over-year for the entire fiscal year in both columns.","Other, no additional items in the fourth quarter. In the last two columns for fiscal \u201914, minus 2 basis points year-over-year that related to a lawsuit recovery over a year ago that benefited us and of course, we didn't have any unusual item offsetting that benefit from a year ago. If you added up, we reported margins up 15 basis points both with and without gas.","Our reported total for the year was up 4 basis points but taking out gas, it was up one basis point. So again, a good showing overall in the fourth quarter in terms of margin improvement.","Now as I mentioned, the core was up 6 basis points. Two of the four core categories, food and sundries and fresh food show higher year-over-year gross margin percentages while year-over-year in Q4, softlines margins were essentially flat year-over-year and hardlines margins were slightly lower.","Ancillary business gross margins were up over 50 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter based on their own sales with gas, optical and hearing aids coming in better year-over-year in Q4. And LIFO again in the fourth quarter, we recorded just under $11 million or 3 basis point pretax charge compared to an $8 million or 3 basis point pretax credit last year for 6 basis point year-over-year swing in the fourth quarter.","Next our SG&A percentages, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, they were lower or better by two basis points coming in at 97.3% as percent of sales, compared to 97.5% last year. Again we\u2019ll do the same four columns, two for the fourth quarter with and without gas and two for the full fiscal year with reported and without gas.","In terms of core operations, we have two, a plus 7 and a plus 7 for the quarter and minus 2 and a plus 1 for the fiscal year. So plus 7 of course would mean that it was lower or better by that many basis points. Central was minus 7 and minus 7 for the quarter and minus 3 and minus 3 for the year.","RSUs a plus 2 and a plus 2 and for the year a minus 2 and a minus 2 and no quarterly adjustments. So total for the quarter both on reported basis without gas, again we were better by 2 basis point or plus 2. For the year, we are higher by seven basis points on a reported basis or minus 7 and without gas minus 4.","Now in terms of our SG&A performance, the core operations again was lower or better by seven basis points. Within core payroll -- within core, payroll and benefits expenses were lower or better year-over-year by 8 basis points, again helped by leveraging sales strength. Similarly other operating expenses as a percent of sales in the quarter were better by four basis points. So total between those two, those three items really would be 12 basis points.","The change in the bonus accrual year-over-year as I discussed earlier, hurt the core component by about five basis points. In terms of central, it was higher again by 7 basis points. About five of that is SG&A variance is related to the ongoing IT modernization efforts and another three is the increased SG&A expense resulting from the year-over-year swing in bonus accrual that\u2019s split between core and central.","And lastly our equity compensation, which is now an important component of the composition to again to about 4000 people. This represented an improvement of 2 basis point positive in SG&A, benefiting from both timing of certain vesting provisions when employees hit 25, 30 and 35 years of service as well as from the strong sales denominator in the fourth quarter.","Next on income statement line preopening, not a whole lot to talk about, $17 million last year in the quarter, $15 million of charges this year in the quarter. Last year, we opened seven units, this year 10, no major surprises there. All told, operating income in the fourth quarter increased 14% or $137 million year-over-year from $954 million last year in the fourth quarter to almost $1.1 billion, $1.91 billion this year in the fourth quarter.","Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was $1 million lower year-over-year coming in at $36 million last year and coming in this year at $35 million for the quarter. Interest income and other, it was lower year-over-year by $6 million, 36 million last year in the fourth quarter compared to $30 million this year. Actual interest income for the quarter was up $3 million coming in at $17 million, compared to $14 million last year.","The other component of interest income -- of interest income and other was lower by $8 million, primarily related to various FX items being mark-to-market at fiscal quarter end. Overall pretax income was up 14% or $132 million to $1.86 billion this year versus last year's fourth quarter, a pretax earnings of $954 million.","In terms of income taxes, tax rate for the quarter came in at 35.1, up three-tenth of a 1% from 34.8% tax rate all in last year. So slightly higher this year and as I explained the reasons for that earlier in the call. Overall net income was up 13% or $80 million to $697 million versus last year's fourth quarter of $617 million. And as I discussed earlier, this figure being achieved notwithstanding several items that in the aggregate did not go our way.","Now for quick rundown of other usual topics, the condensed balance sheet is included in this morning's press release with a couple of items from the balance sheet and the couple cash flow items I will point out here. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $321 million and for the year $1.29 billion.","In terms of accounts payable as a percent of inventory, on a reported basis both last year and this year's fourth quarter, it was right at 100%. Payables, of course, include things other than merchandise payables like construction payables. If you look at just merchandise payables as percent of inventory in both fiscal quarters, we were at 89% year-over-year. So almost 90% of our inventories being financed with trade payables.","Average inventory per warehouse, last year fourth quarter end, $12.5 million, up a tick this year in the fourth quarter at $12.8 million, we\u2019re up about $300,000 or 2%. The $300,000 increase, about 80% of that is in four of our merchandised subdepartments. Majors was up about $91,000, some of that is the reintroduction of Apple products. Men's apparel was up about $55,000. Foods was up $61,000 and meats were up $39,000, the latter two being somewhat related to inflation.","In terms of CapEx, in the fourth quarter we spent $567 million. For all of fiscal \u201814, total CapEx was right at $2 billion. Our estimate for fiscal \u201815 CapEx is quite a bit higher, probably in $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion range. The year-over-year increase in CapEx represents our plans for more openings this year that of course includes the four relos versus last year.","Increased spending for remodeling activities and expanding ancillary business operations, planned expansion of our cross-stock depot operations, anticipate spending later in the year for some additional openings earlier in fiscal -- in the subsequent fiscal year and increased level of IT spending for the modernization efforts.","In terms of Costco online, we\u2019re currently operated in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico. We\u2019d expect to be in at least one, probably two additional countries by the end of calendar \u201815. For the fiscal year, total e-commerce sales came in just under $3 billion.","For both fiscal fourth quarter and the fiscal year, sales and profits were up. Sales in e-commerce were up in the high teens for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year and comp sales in e-commerce were up in the 18% to 19% range for both the fourth quarter and the fiscal year.","Over the past two years as I mentioned, we replatformed our site, we've introduced new apps. We\u2019ve combined some e-commerce merchandising efforts within line efforts. We've added new categories including areas like apparel, health and beauty aids, and some sundries. And we've improved distribution and delivery time.","In addition, outside of e-commerce as you know, we\u2019ve continued over the last -- much of this past calendar year testing Google Shopping Express. That continues with a great partner with Google. The trending is positive in terms of member spending and also signing up some new members. But again it\u2019s still a test. We continued to add items to that delivery process. Currently, it's in three geographic areas, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York and more to come, I\u2019m sure.","Next discussion in terms of expansion. Again for fiscal \u201914 as ended, we opened 30. Acapulco was closed due to weather-related destruction, so ended up a net of increase last year of 29. This year, assuming, we opened the planned 31 and we open 35 but those are relos, so a planned net new of 31. Eight would be in the first quarter, none in the second quarter, two in the third quarter and 21 in the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ve got a lot going on, I think, that again we will probably see, at least couple of them. One or two of those perhaps to be up a little bit, but few be pushed into the next -- early the next fiscal year. So in fiscal 14, we added 29 on a base of 634 or about 5% square footage growth.","In fiscal \u201915, assuming 31, it will be about 4.5% to 5% square footage growth. In terms of the 31 this year, if we get all those open, 19 would be in the U.S., one each in Canada and the U.K. In Asia overall six, three in Korea, two in Japan and one in Taiwan, one additional in Australia that we are seventh in Australia, two more in Mexico and one more in Spain. As of Q4 end, total square footage stood at 95.3 million square feet.","One last comment regarding openings and operations in Cabo San Lucas Mexico, Costco like many other businesses was a victim of the recent hurricane on September \u201814th and the subsequent looting that took place and that we are currently closed. We plan to be back up and operating by early November.","In terms of common stock repurchases, we began our recent repurchasing activities on March 7th, the day after our second quarter earnings release was released. In Q3, we purchased 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14 for a total spend of just under $184 million. During the fourth quarter, we purchased 1.3 million shares at an average price of $116.11, or a total dollar amount of $150 million.","In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.355 a share or annualizes a $1.42, that's up 14.5% from the previous year\u2019s dividend rate. This $1.42 per share divided represents an annual cost of the company of about $625 million.","Lastly, our fiscal \u201815 first quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Thursday, December 11th, for that will be for the 12-week this first quarter ending on November 23rd.","With that, I'll turn it over to Brandy for Q&A. Brandy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","So, Richard, a few things, the gross margin being up in the food categories, is that cost of product to you? I know you talk about inflation, but is that cost of product driven, is that mix driven, where is that coming from?","Richard Galanti","Without looking at the detail, yes, most of it is cost of product driven. The examples of course would be, I mentioned before poultry prices to us have come down a little bit as we locked in versus where they had been. We didn\u2019t change the price, needless to say, of those items upward. I think we\u2019ve had a little bit of hit in the food court similarly for that reason.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Do you think -- as Kirkland gets bigger and gets more scaled, do you think there is -- can that move the needle on gross margin either in terms of margin on the product or mix?","Richard Galanti","I think it does a couple of things. Generally, the answer is yes. And also as KS product takes share from a branded product, it generally move the branded product to come down and price to us, which again gives us even more competitive loyalty with our members. So there's a lot of good things there. Certainly, the needle -- the low-hanging fruit occurred many years ago. You've heard examples of, whether it\u2019s toilet paper or disposable diapers where you have items that are very, very competitive branded items. We can come in with a great value, a great quality item and make a fairer margin to us but still a great savings to the customer. So it works but it moves the needle slightly.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","One of the countries you didn\u2019t talk about, good or bad was the U.K. Obviously there's a lot going on there. Just generally speaking, how do you find you are performing in the U.K. top and bottom line today?","Richard Galanti","Well, two things to finish some thing I thought about after I finished the first answer. The added benefit of course is not just KS but the increase in organic sales. That\u2019s something I think that competitively gives us a leg up, because it's where more margin historically has been made in retail organic. We can provide better savings and has other positive attributes in terms of the type of member that shops with that stuff. In terms of the U.K., it was still positive. It was at the lower end low single digits. Actually, U.K. has shown some improvement.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","You mentioned organic. Two things. What is happening to assortment there? And then secondly, it does look like on a variety of levels in terms of just product placement, marketing, you are trying to drive that significantly. So that\u2019s got to be still one of the fastest-growing departments in food. Do you think that -- is that helping you much with the Millennials or is that yet to come?","Richard Galanti","Well, it\u2019s helping. It\u2019s probably a bigger percentage now because it\u2019s on a small base. You look at, I think couple of quarters ago I talked about like fresh ground beef, organic ground. It\u2019s an infinite percentage increase from 0 to 25 or so million of that first year. As I mentioned earlier, what we are finding with all of these items is that it\u2019s incremental sales because it was loyal members that didn't buy ground beef from us before, now they are. This year, organic ground beef sales were up dramatically because the supply is up dramatically. So, yes, again, there are big numbers on -- it's one of those good things but it\u2019s lots of little things.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.","Peter Benedict - Robert Baird","Hey, Richard, couple of questions. First, just the membership promos you are doing with LivingSocial, how are those funded? Are the vendors contributing any of that or are you guys funding all that?","Richard Galanti","Take an example of -- I think we are doing most of the funding of that. Certainly to the extent, there is identity protection. We have some vendor support, I\u2019m sure. I don't know exactly but I\u2019m sure we do. The other items, on the food items, there are items, the KS bath tissue, rotisserie chicken. I\u2019m not sure if there's a little support from the manufacturers but I would assume it\u2019s part of the member procurement costs on our side.","Peter Benedict - Robert Baird","All right. Okay. And then the plans for the Canadian cash that you're bringing in?","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s really just moving it down here. As we read about everyday in the paper, money is stuck at multinational companies outside of the U.S. We have the ability -- based on when the monies were earned over the last 20 years. Years ago, basically the marginal, federal, corporate tax rate in Canada versus U.S. was a lot closer than I think the roughly 13 percentage points difference now roughly 26% versus 39%. These first billion dollars, if you will, bring in $2 million I think I mentioned is translated into U.S. dollars, is at an effective rate of about 1.25% tax rate. So we opted to move it. Canada, of course is very profitable. It has its own column in the segment analysis. You can kind of figure that out. While we are still adding two or three units, our CapEx is dwarfed by our earnings up there and so we will continue to make money. And we saw this as an opportune time to be able to start that process.","Peter Benedict - Robert Baird","Okay, perfect. And then last question just, how do you guys you think about the timing of introducing the executive membership option into new markets? What are the main considerations and how should we think about that for getting in some of these markets where you are not in? I\u2019m thinking of Asia.","Richard Galanti","Yeah, I think there is two things. One is that how big is the country in terms of how many units we have. And secondly, can we get -- I guess there are three things. That was the first one.","Second would be putting a menu of services together that we can do. And of course as we get bigger and a relatively bigger in a given country that buying power allows us to do that. And then what else we have going on in using Japan as an example, we've gone from what 9 to 23 or 24 units in about 2.5 years. So I think we like it, we like executive member program, and long-term we would like to see it another countries, but those are the types of factors.","Peter Benedict - Robert Baird","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Mike Otway - Wolfe Research","Hey, good morning. This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. Richard, in terms of SG&A, you laid out the buckets. As we think about next year, is there any -- are there any buckets that are likely to move SG&A a bit higher than this year, or perhaps a little lower? I know you mentioned you are spending a bit more on IT modernization, how does that flow through the P&L? Any color there would be great.","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, first and foremost, it\u2019s sales growth. I mean, if we can get good sales growth, that helps a lot of things. Certainly, increased penetration in some of our overseas markets actually helps quite a bit, because of various things. The healthcare expenses as a percent of sales are much lower in virtually every other country than United States. Labor costs are different and generally lower in other countries as a percent of sales. So I think those things will probably help us.","In terms of IT modernization, as I\u2019ve kind of laid out over the last couple of years each quarter, incrementally we would expect that to be in the low to mid -- low to low mid-teens incremental over a three or four years. I think we\u2019re probably up to 10 or 11 basis point or maybe 9 or 10 basis points over the last couple years and we will continue to see that this year. I don't think it's going to help us anytime soon. It probably is a slight negative impact certainly in fiscal \u201915, maybe a little in fiscal '16 before it flattens out and hopefully starts to go the other way a little bit.","Beyond that, healthcare is always none known in the U.S. And again as I mentioned, I think to the extent that the healthcare continues to be the inflationary aspects of healthcare in the US. And as you know, we haven't done -- aren\u2019t going to make major changes, like sending a bunch of people out of it. That\u2019s an expensive cost to us and we\u2019re probably be able do that. Notwithstanding that, even if that continues in its slightly greater than sale, topline sales rate of growth, increasing penetration of healthcare costs outside of the U.S. will help mitigate any damage there. So I don't think there's anything new to add to this process, those kinds of things.","Mike Otway - Wolfe Research","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of the consumer, have you seen any real change there in the last few months? And then specifically with your business in the Midwest and Southeast, maybe what you're seeing in those regions relative to it\u2019s clearly strong, what's going on there versus some other places in the country?","","Richard Galanti","Well, I think with Midwest, certainly it\u2019s a newer region relatively speaking. We are getting -- we seem to have I think hitting our sweet spots in some of those cities. Same in the Southeast, we\u2019ve opened in areas like Louisiana and Alabama and Georgia and Florida with some additional units and South Carolina. They are generally tending to do pretty well. So I think a few actually years there have helped us frankly. I can't tell you much more than that in terms of the little color on the consumer.","Some of the usual suspects, good suspects if you will in terms of merchandise categories, some of the nonfoods, softlines and hardlines categories like apparel and housewares and domestics, those of all done well in part because of our commitment to them. Our increasing commitment of apparel area would be one example. Clearly having the demographic or member I think helps. Having strength in gas, I mean gas sales were up, I think I mentioned I think 4% -- notwithstanding -- 3% or 4%, notwithstanding 4% or so percent decline in average sales price per gallon. So gallons were up nicely and that\u2019s driving, no pun intended but driving people into the Costco parking lots.","Mike Otway - Wolfe Research","Great. Thanks, Richard. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Thanks for taking my question. I'd just like to talk a little bit about, as you think about international growth, I noticed that there's -- you didn\u2019t mention opening anything in France, I think in this coming year. Are you looking just to continue to fill out the markets where you already operate? Or are you considering moving into another new market, and obviously Spain is still very new but\u2026?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, both Spain and France, I think we probably started talking about those two countries three years ago. And at the time, we felt that it could be three or more years based on the permitting and appeal processes and various not only countries, but cities and communities. And that\u2019s certainly why we keep at this point pushing out France, we will continue to look at that. And again, we will have our second opening in Spain later in calendar \u201915. We haven't mentioned any other countries beyond that. If I was a betting person, absolutely in the few years but not in the next year, year and half.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","And maybe you could just comment a little bit about real estate in the U.S., are you finding any changes in the environments, harder to find locations, working with developers, anything different?","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s anything different. In some of the markets, it becomes -- it\u2019s ever increase -- increasingly more difficult. In the greater LA where we've got 40 or 50 units, many, many units, we feel that over the next 10 years we could open another 10 or 15, but they are all very pinpointed locations based on where other locations, other Costco locations are, so it\u2019s -- and it\u2019s densely populated and it\u2019s difficult, but that's what we do.","And we\u2019ve got a lot more people in the real estate area over the last few years, we\u2019ve got more in the pipeline and we think we\u2019ll get there. I think also in -- and we are fortunate of the sense that many of the markets, be it Texas, Midwest, Southeast, some of the markets that we are newer and over the last 10 years, not the last 30 years, we\u2019re able to go into. And again given our demographic, we\u2019re able to find some locations. Certainly, we also get some calls as you might expect from developers, but it's probably an increasingly difficult effort and that's why we've added more infrastructure to pursue that.","Overseas every country is a little different. I think as I mentioned in Asia this coming year we have I think six plan 3, 2 and 1. Of course we\u2019ve opened a bunch in Japan in last two years already. And so again it takes a lot longer, but we\u2019ve got a lot in the pipeline too and so we will continue to see some growth there.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Simon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. It\u2019s Joshua Siber on for Simon Gutman. I am curious, if you guys are seeing areas of the store where customers are more or less sensitive to price increases and how much room you have to further pass-through greater costs in these categories?","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019re most sensitive to us. We haven't seen any major change in level of competition out there, I mean everybody is tough and we\u2019re pretty tough ourselves. So I don't think so. I mean, I think, it\u2019s continuing as it goes. I think some of our margin improvement of late has become as we have not raised prices, but some of the underlying costs have come down and some of that hurt is behind us, but tomorrow is another day.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Sorry. Go ahead.","Richard Galanti","The list of price increases is not a big list around here.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Richard Galanti","Relatively speaking.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","Sure. For the members that you picked up on LivingSocial, do these customers shop online more frequently and is there a noticeable difference in basket in terms of pricing or content?","Richard Galanti","They are so new, I can\u2019t really tell you. This most recent program was early about three weeks ago and the process is they redeem their coupon, then they come in and a lot of them are coming in. But I would guess generally speaking compared to the first test we did on a regional basis within social a few months earlier, you do have a higher percentage of millennials. But by getting new member millennials or otherwise, when new member first starts to shop, they are generally shopping small basket sizes and a little bit more food-oriented to start with. And that\u2019s been historically a typical for -- a typically pattern. So, it\u2019s too early to tell.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. And then just one more housekeeping question. Is the $150 million buyback that you guys spent in fourth quarter a good run rate to go forward?","Richard Galanti","","I can\u2019t really respond to that. I can tell you that we -- historically when we have bought back we have bought through blackout periods using 10b5-1s, our longest blackout period of the year which is six or seven weeks long, stretching from early -- I guess from late July, early August all the way to today.","You have to basically put in place something. Well, if you go back that many weeks, the stock at the time was in the mid to high, 115 to 117. And so we hadn\u2019t bought for the last few weeks of the quarter, but that would imply a little longer, a bigger run rate, but it will go up and down a little bit. I think that we are intent on buying some stock back.","Joshua Siber - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Thanks for the color, guys.","","Operator","","Your next question is from David Schick with Stifel.","David Schick - Stifel","Hi. Good morning. You talked in the call about the high-teens growth of online and you talked about the success of the Google partnership. And you said profit growth was I think at a similar pace. But going back to what you said; if you could just give any more details on how the profitability or the growth thereof is trending in online, that would be helpful. Thanks.","","Richard Galanti","","The profit was very good. I don\u2019t think we really give out profit growth numbers there and that 3% piece of our business. The good news, it\u2019s growing and it is more profitable. E-commerce is definitely quite a bit more profitable than the rest of the company. And so 3% of sales implies a greater percent increase of earnings.","","David Schick - Stifel","Is it more profitable on a flow-through basis than it was at this time last year?","Richard Galanti","","Let me correct that, 3% of sales, a higher percent of sales profitability than the company overall. So every time we can grow those sales, you will see earnings grow nicely too.","David Schick - Stifel","And then is the operating margin of it -- if you don\u2019t want to detail that, that's fine, but is it growing beyond the revenue, is it levering, or is it expanding the total loaded margin? ","Richard Galanti","","Well, the problem you\u2019ve is that we\u2019ve opened recently in a couple of new countries in the last year and half. And so we\u2019re spending a lot of money on that. We spent a lot money on apps upgrading. And so I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me, but I know it\u2019s growing and it\u2019s profitable. And we are continuing to pursue it.","David Schick - Stifel","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question is from Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","Hi. Thanks, Richard. A couple questions. Love to start on membership fee income, so it was up 7%, what was it in local currencies? And in terms of membership growth, how much of that you think is driven by the new clubs? ","","Richard Galanti","","Let me answer the first question. It was up 8% without FX and dollars. And what was the other question?","Greg Melich - ISI Group","So I think you said memberships were up 7%. I was trying to get a sense of how much of that was driven by the new openings, particularly in these markets where you have been very successful and you've had huge membership growth with some of the new clubs.","Richard Galanti","","I don\u2019t have it in front of me. I\u2019m sure that made it healthy. I can remember over the years when sometimes it\u2019s a little down year-over-year because a year ago we had some foreign operations with those outsized, new sign-ups and fewer international the next year. I don't know off the top of my head.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","All right. So use 8% as the local currency number?","","Richard Galanti","Yes. ","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay. And then second, I wanted to understand a little bit more about the gross margin in ancillary. I guess that was up -- you said up 50 bps in ancillary, which was 50?","","Richard Galanti","The ancillary, if you totaled ancillary gross margin divided by total ancillary business sales, it was up a little over 50 basis points. Different ancillary businesses were up or down differently, that in addition to strong sales in those areas. So the combination of increasing penetration and increasing margins was at a higher level benefit to the total company gross margin. Gas being the outsized one there.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","How should we think about the sustainability of that on gas? Like, are we now at what would be a normal run rate there? And also is dot-com -- where does that show up in your nice little bridge you do?","","Richard Galanti","Well, dot-com is in the core. It\u2019s on percent\u2026","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Okay. That\u2019s the reason.","Richard Galanti","Dot-com, no. In terms of sustainability of gas profits, I only wish. We\u2019ve probably been on a little longer run of good gas profitability the last several months. Generally speaking, when gas prices year-over-year are flat or declining as they are now that's good news. We save the customer more and we make more.","When they are growing up fast, we save the company and the customer little less and we make it less. And so we've been blessed by having a positive run here for several months. But it\u2019s a volatile area. Now that\u2019s just looking with false blinds on just gas operation. That doesn\u2019t take into the account fact that every time we can get somebody to come in and get gas. That\u2019s incrementally a potential positive shop in the warehouse as well as and so that we of course don't consider is part of that.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Is it fair to say that the 15 bps that you cited that gas was half of that? I think you listed it first when you talked about optical and hearing aids and gas.","","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. I bet it\u2019s half or more. It\u2019s not all.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Got it. And then lastly just on the inventory increase, it sounded like you gave those four areas which is all very clear. Was there anything unusual about that other than restocking Apple that you wouldn't use that as sort of a trend going forward in those categories?","","Richard Galanti","Actually, the trend -- this is, I think probably the lowest year-over-year average increase in merchandised inventories. For few years there, we've been running up 5%, 6%, 7%, 8% year-over-year in the inventory levels. In the last couple of quarters on a year-over-year basis, we've been down in the 2% or 3% range.","So actually it\u2019s come in better in my view, I mean, 2%, whatever a 3% increase in inventories on a 2% increase in inventories on a 7%, or 8% or 9% increase in total sales. I think the anomaly there would be adding some product on that side and the anomaly, of course with inflation and fresh foods. But that\u2019s going to fluctuate as well. So, I think overall probably this is -- we looked at this as being a little bit better level of increase in average inventories per warehouse.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","And it sounds like you think it's sustainable at this rate?","Richard Galanti","At this point, are you sure?","Greg Melich - ISI Group","","Yeah. Thanks a lot.","Richard Galanti","That could change tomorrow. You never know.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","I know. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question is from Mathew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot and good morning. A couple of quick ones here. First of all, I know that you essentially mark-to-market for LIFO at the end of any given quarter or so. So your expectation is that you are probably going to be clean as you go into next year. That being said with the trends that you're seeing in pricing in key categories, what is your initial thinking on the direction that might move in 2015 relative to this past year?","","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s hard to know. The only person, I\u2019ve actually talk to is in the area of fresh foods and there's anticipation of continuing overall inflationary trend there. Although some of it, when it's deflationary, it\u2019s because -- I think butter had skyrocketed and now it\u2019s coming down a little. I might be wrong on the commodity there but probably still a little bit of inflation.","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Okay. A quick second question here. You mentioned in your gross margin discussion that a hard line was down a bit year-on-year. Just interested in any color in terms of the drivers there?","Richard Galanti","","Yeah. I think, for the quarter it was flat. Nothing really stood out. I mean, majors versus electronics was up slightly, nothing really stands out there.","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then finally, you had a question earlier about some of the membership deals that you are running, for example, the one with LivingSocial but really who bore the economic costs. I guess my question is, and I know that this is pretty small potatoes for the moment, how do you account for those subsidies? Does it reduce the membership fee income or does it show up in some other line item?","","Richard Galanti","It\u2019s allocated between sales and membership but it\u2019s mostly membership.","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Okay. So for the year -- sorry go ahead.","Richard Galanti","That\u2019s over the year. I mean, and it\u2019s amortized over the year. I will have to find out. I don\u2019t -- it's so small. It\u2019s less than a rounding error.","Mathew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Fair enough. Okay. I appreciate it. Thank you.","","Richard Galanti","","Is that it?","Operator","Your next question comes from Charles Grom with Sterne Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne Agee","Thanks. Good morning, Richard. Nice quarter. Just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about Google Express and what\u2019s the ultimate goal of that program? Is it to drive increased memberships? Is it for you to get younger? And I guess what's holding you guys back on rolling it out to more than just the few regions where it's being tested today?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all we talk about us and Google partnering on this. They\u2019re partnering with a number of other retailers as well. You can go to Google Shopping Express in each of those three geographic markets and see about other retailers. We\u2019re certainly, I think a big component of it but we\u2019re big component of anything we do. And it\u2019s been good so far. I think you really have to ask them that. I would assume they are looking at additional markets but as they are announced, you\u2019ll find out as well.","Generally speaking, ultimately, we always asked about all the concerns with delivery and e-commerce and all that stuff. And we recognize, we\u2019re not going to be the guy that drops off Fruity Pebbles cereal and a quarter milk before your kid wakes up in the morning for breakfast, if you ordered it before 10 p.m. a night before. But we started our business being a wholesale supplier. In this case, it\u2019s kind of hopefully a win-win, not only for Google Shopping Express but for us.","We are seeing incremental business from it but there is -- again there is a lot of nuances to it, so far so good. But again, the biggest test it\u2019s been around for seven -- eight or nine months I guess, since January in the Bay Area and a lot fewer months in L.A. and New York. We like it because it\u2019s our member and there is net positive aspect of it. You can\u2019t get Costco items through Google Express unless you are a Costco member. And we have seen incremental signups because of that.","And look, we appreciate the fact that it\u2019s a way to self merchandise, as well it\u2019s a way to get some members over time as well it\u2019s a great way in our view to have -- ultimately, we want to get you into the store or into warehouses more frequently also and we think there\u2019s avenues to do that. But it\u2019s really too early to know other than as its likely rolled out to other cities. We\u2019ll be part of that at this point in time.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. So another initiative you guys have is to get younger is this organic offering. I'm just wondering if you could just put things into context of where you guys are today, either number of SKUs or percentage of sales, to where you were a couple of years ago.","Richard Galanti","Organic was about $3 billion I\u2019m told by one of the many people in my office right now last year and growing dramatically, a part of that supply and part of that\u2019s pushing it more. I don\u2019t think we said around the number of years ago and said let\u2019s do organic to get millennials. I think what happened is as we saw items and as those items grow and we see that it\u2019s got great attributes for us. Wonder we didn\u2019t even realize until we saw it.","We can generally provide a better savings than others because other retailers sometimes will use it as an ability to get more margins and so it show greater savings. It\u2019s a higher price point item than the substitute item. And again the added benefit was as in some instances, I\u2019ve used the ground beef example.","We had existing loyal members that 80%, I know in the first year assume it could be a little lower. Now but a large percentage of those were incremental sales because those were existing members that didn\u2019t buy their ground beef at Costco. So to the extent that you have, be it Millennial or otherwise but to the extent, you have somebody that is an organic buyer that may have left Costco but if we don\u2019t have an organic alternative, they go to shop elsewhere for that item.","Now, so that helps unforgettably more frequently to Costco but we\u2019re doing it because we\u2019re selling those items. And as it increases -- we've had organic milk for a number of years and certainly we\u2019re able to use our buying power and our sourcing to continue to drive that.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. And just switching gears a little bit, it's been a while since I've heard you guys articulate a longer-term store goal. And I'm just wondering if you are willing to share one now. And as a follow-up to that, 19 clubs in the U.S this year out of, say, roughly 31. When does the pendulum shift to more international locations where you are doing 19 international, say, as opposed to 19 in the U.S. for this year?","Richard Galanti","I think over the next five years. If you look that a year ago, I think, we talked about the fact that over a five-year period we\u2019d expect to open roughly 30 a year, maybe starting at 28 or 29 and after 33 or 35 and we\u2019re kind of in that. I guess, you\u2019re two or two and a half of that five years. I think the fact that we\u2019re opening a few more -- if you ask me four years ago, I would guess, it might be more evenly split right now. I think that\u2019s simply a function of availability and speed at which you get things done here.","When you're looking at 20 million population city in Asia, there is all kinds of issues and again, as I\u2019ve mentioned, we\u2019ve got more people in real estate on the ground in each of these countries compared to very few on the ground five years ago.","So the pipeline is definitely more filled. And I guess, from -- looking at it in a positive way, I -- the question of, when do you going to slowdown in the U.S because of anticipated saturation, where -- I am happy to report that that\u2019s not happening yet.","It will happen at some point, but if anything, it's probably that pendulum has probably swung the other way a little bit in the last couple years in part because some of the strength in those markets where we've been in 10 to 15 years or less not 25 and 30 years.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Interesting. And any thought on a longer term store goal that you guys have?","Richard Galanti","Other than more, I think, if you ask, Jeff and Craig and the heads of operations, if it were this current might, as I defined it five-year period, its 30 -- a little over 30-year. I think we like to get up to 35 a year in the next five years, maybe a little more. So we\u2019ll continue to try to push that a little bit and we feel we have the capabilities to do that that depends of course on continued success in these markets.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. And then the last question just on the margins as a follow-up to I believe Matt's question, just wondering if you could speak to the degree of improvement on food and sundries and fresh relative to the third quarter, which I believe your food and sundries was up 20 and then fresh was down a couple of basis points? I know you said it was positive, just wondering if you could give us the degree of improvement?","Richard Galanti","I think it\u2019s in the -- I don\u2019t have it right in front of me, but it was less than up 50 and more than up 10, I don\u2019t have it in front of me.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","I\u2019m sorry, could you repeat that?","Richard Galanti","Less than up 50 and more than up 10 basis points.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay.","Richard Galanti","I think, somewhere in the high teens or 20s, I don\u2019t -- I could be off a little bit, but there wasn\u2019t -- one of them wasn\u2019t up 1 basis point and the other up 80. They were both up.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks again.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Exstein with Credit Suisse.","Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse","Morning. It\u2019s Charlene Wong on for Michael Exstein. What\u2019s your initial experience in Spain been like?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m sorry. What was the question?","Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse","What has your initial experience in Spain been like?","Richard Galanti","Well, so far, it\u2019s fine. I mean, our member signups are strong and continuing. As we expect when we go into a completely new country, you generally see smaller baskets to start with. We haven't -- needless to say, we\u2019ve only been here for three or four months so we haven\u2019t anniversaried anything in terms of seeing any type of renewal rates. But we\u2019re pushing forward. We\u2019re working on our sites in Spain. So, no major differences of expectations.","Charlene Wong - Credit Suisse","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi, Richard. Just got a couple of questions for you, though. On the fourth quarter what was the percentage of sales to the total and I'm not sure if you gave it, but can you talk a little bit about in September the impact on gas and FX were to the month of September sales?","Richard Galanti","Yes. I can. Gas was, well, let\u2019s say, FX was 120 drag and gas was about 0.5 a point, just 48 basis points.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. Great. And then just the last question that I have is, on the openings for the next fiscal year, are you -- the timing of them, why are they so back-half weighted?","Richard Galanti","Well, the biggest reason is, we try to open everything as soon as we can, other than when there's some craziness, because if it\u2019s up in Minnesota and its in the snow and the grounds frozen, you might lose four months and you can\u2019t get the foundation, the ground dug and the foundation set.","But it's just timing of when they are. We would love to push a few of them sooner. That\u2019s generally our best guess of where they are. Its really, I mean, the impact is and I\u2019m sure by Q3 as we know more specifics about how many will open we will have a little color on pre-opening expense. But other than that it\u2019s a manageable process.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","And there are no additional questions at this time.","Richard Galanti","Well, thank you very much. And Bob and Jeff and I will be in the second day of our budget meeting for a couple hours but feel free to leave the message. We\u2019ll get back to you after noon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

I will come back to this in a moment.","In terms of sales for the quarter, total sales were up 1%, which again was impacted by the extra week. Comp sales, which compares like 16 week periods were up 5% both on a reported basis and excluding gas and FX. For the quarter gas prices year-over-year were effectively flat, so no impact on the 5% U.S comp figure. However, foreign currencies weakened related to the U.S dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily in Canada and Japan. Such that our reported 4% international comp figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been up 7%.","In terms of sales for the five week September period, total sales increased 6% year-over-year. Reported comparable sales increased 3%, and that 3 was comprised of a 4 in the U.S and zero internationally. And excluding gas and FX, comparable sales would have been up 5%. The four U.S reported would have been a five excluding gas deflation and zero internationally would have been an up six assuming FX was flat year-over-year in local currencies.","In terms of comparing our $1.40 reported earnings for the fourth quarter to last year\u2019s fourth quarter of a $1.39, several items to note. First a few items that I\u2019ve discussed each in the prior several earnings calls. Last year\u2019s fourth quarter had an extra week simply dividing the 17 weeks intuitively $1.39 figure would have suggested that the benefits from that extra week was about $0.08 a share. Membership fee income of course included about $25 million pre-tax extra and that relates to the late 2011, early 2012 annual fee increase in the U.S and Canada and how that works way to our income statement based on deferred accounting over about a 23 months period.","Interest expense of course was higher in the fourth quarter by about $13 million pre-tax were $0.02 a share. This related to last December\u2019s $3.5 billion debt offering that was done in conjunction with $7 per share special dividend.","There are also a few items that year-to-date through the first three quarters have represented a positive year-over-year profit variances, but that\u2019s one the other way in Q4 year-over-year. For example FX on a strengthening foreign currency is relative to the U.S dollar added to earnings per share year-to-date through the first three quarters and swung the other way in the fourth quarter.","In Q4 foreign currencies -- the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S dollar, resulting in foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S dollars being lower by about $10 million pre-tax or penny and half a share then those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year. A similar year-over-year profit swing occurred in the profitability of our gasoline operations.","Year-to-date through the third quarter the gas profitability was higher year-over-year through the third quarter year-to-date. In Q4 it too swung in the other way coming in lower at Q4 year-over-year. In addition to these factors, I point out in our discussion of SG&A, a few other items that resulted in our expense percentages coming in higher year-over-year in Q4.","In terms of new openings, for all fiscal \u201913 we opened 26 new locations, 12 in the U.S, three each in Canada and the U.K., five in Japan and one each in Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, ending fiscal \u201913 with 634 locations worldwide. For fiscal 2014 we\u2019ve ramped up our expansion plan on our documented plans to open 36 new warehouses with half of these in the U.S. and the remaining in international markets, including our first two plan for Spain next spring and summer.","Inevitably a few of these will probably get delayed. So I would estimate that a number in the low to mid 30s is more likely still a pretty good increase about the 16 and 26 new warehouses opened in each of the past two fiscal years.","During the first four months of 2014 through calendar year-end, we plan to open 15 of these locations, 10 in the U.S including three next week, two each in Canada and Australia and one in Mexico. Also this morning I will review with you our member trends, our e-commerce activity and of course additional discussion about margins and SG&A.","Quickly on the start to the call here in terms of fourth quarter results, more detail. Sales for the year's fourth quarter were $31.8 billion, up 1% from last year's 17 week fourth-quarter of $31.5 billion. Again if you normalize the 17 weeks by taking 16, 17 --, if you will, would have been up 7% on a normalized comparable week basis.","Our reported comp basis, Q4 comps were up 5% for the quarter. For the quarter our 5% reported comp was a combination of almost flat average transaction for the quarter that included the detriment of FX of about 80 basis points. So we are moving up slightly without assuming flat FX and an average frequency increased in the quarter of 4.5% up.","In terms of comparisons by geography regions most U.S regions registered mid single digit comp increases for the quarter with Texas, Midwest and Southeast being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, Korea and Taiwan were on the weak end due in part to cannibalization on relatively small base of existing units. With Canada and Mexico the strongest in terms of comp sales increases.","In terms of comp sales by merchandised category for the quarter, within food and sundries, which were mostly in the mid single digits. Deli, wine and spirits, beer, frozen foods and candy were all relative standouts. Within hardlines, fairly flat numbers year-over-year. The departments with the strong results for office, health and beauty aids and hardware. Electronic sales, which is a relatively large size sub department within hardlines was weaker year-over-year in the fourth quarter.","For softlines low-double digits for the quarter; small electrics, housewares, domestics and apparel were standouts and the same old department media continuing being the relatively weak department there.","In fresh foods, comp sales in the mid-single digits; deli and produce showing the best result. In September, the five-week month, sales were $9.9 billion, up 6% from last year's September reporting period. On a comp basis, September comps were reported \u2013 were up a reported 3% for the month.","That 3% included a negative 1.3% average transaction. This includes the detriment of FX of about 1.5 percentage points and deflationary gasoline which deflated quite a bit, about 1 percentage point. So the 1.5% and the 1%, those 2.5 percentage points negative is included in that minus 1.3% transaction. Average frequency up about 4%. Excluding FX and gas effects, comp sales for the month of September were plus 5%.","In terms of sales by geography from September, most of U.S. regions were in the low to mid single digit comps with Southeast and Texas being on the strong end. Internationally, Korea and Japan were on the weak side of all the international countries with Canada and Mexico showing the strongest comp sales increases in local currency.","In terms of category sales for September, food and sundries, low to mid singles; hardlines, low singles similar to the quarter. Softlines in the low to mid teens, up a little bit from the quarter. Fresh foods continues in the mid single digit range, led again by produce and service deli.","And lastly ancillary business comps were slightly negative on a reported basis basically due to the gasoline business which experienced 8% deflation year-over-year in the average price per gallon during the five-week monthly reporting period. Gallons in terms of gas were slightly positive.","Moving on down the line items in the income statement, membership fees were up 3% or about $22 million, an increase of 4 basis points year-over-year to $716 million. Both membership fee members for this year's fourth quarter and last year's had some items to look at. Within the $716 million, of course it was \u2013 this year it included the $25 million benefit as I talked about from the fee increase.","And last year's $694 again it was a 17-week quarter, taking one-seventeenth out of that it would reduce that number by 41 million. So I think the 3% reported increase in dollars again adjusting it for those two anomalies would have been up about 6%. But the 3% is what we reported.","In terms of membership, renewal rates remain strong both in the U.S. and Canada and worldwide. We continue to strengthen our executive membership program. New member sign ups in the quarter companywide were very strong, up 9% year-over-year despite one less week in the quarter. That strong performance was mostly reflective of very strong sign up and our three Japan openings that opened in the fourth quarter. As I've mentioned in the past, we get very strong opening sign ups at locations in Asia and Australia.","In terms of number of members at fourth quarter end, Gold Star and in the quarter and year at 28.9 million up from 28.2 million 16 weeks earlier. Primary business remained at 6.6 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million. Again you get some of those add-ons moving into other categories as they opt for executive. Total paid memberships went from 38.3 million at Q3 end and 39 million at fiscal year end. And total cards went from 69.9 million at third quarter end to 71.2 million at fiscal year end.","Executive members continue to increase. We're up over 13.5 million at the end of the fiscal year which is about 250,000 increase in terms of members since Q3 end or about 15,000 a week added during the quarter. As I've mentioned before, executive members are over third of our member race and about two-thirds of our sales as well.","In terms of membership renewal rates, they too continue strong. Our business renewal rates went from 93.9 at the end of the third quarter tweaked up to 94.0. Gold Star went from 88.9 to 89.1, so total business in Gold Star went from 89.9 to 90.0. Those numbers by the way are for U.S. and Canada which we've always showed in the aggregate. That's a little over 82%, 83% of our business.","Worldwide the number went from an 86.4 at the end of the third quarter to an 86.3 and the reason there is with all these new international openings you're always going to have much lower renewal rates in start-ups years of new occasions, and particularly in new markets.","Going down the gross margin line, again I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have four columns. The columns would be reported and without gas and the second column without gas. That will be Q3 '13 and Q3 '13. The third and fourth columns would be reported for Q4 '13 without gas for Q4 '13. As I mentioned in Q4, there was no inflation so the third and fourth columns will be the same numbers.","The line items, the first one will be core merchandizing. Going across to the four columns would be minus 5 basis points year-over-year, minus 11, minus 4 and minus 4. Ancillary and other businesses; plus 6, plus 5 and then plus 3 and plus 3 in the last two columns. 2% reward minus 2 across the board. LIFO, plus 6 and plus 6 in the Q3 columns and plus 7 and plus 7 in the Q4 columns. And other there was plus 7 and plus 7 in the Q3 columns and 0 and 0 in Q4 columns. That related to a loss in recovery that we mentioned last quarter.","All told, reported in Q3 year-over-year, gross margin was up 12 basis points. But again taking out gas inflation, it was up 5. This year both on a reported and without gas, it was up 4 basis points. I'll provide a little color on these numbers. Core merchandize component to gross margin was down 4 basis points year-over-year. Three of the four core categories; food and sundries, hardlines and softlines showed higher year-over-year gross margin percentage on their own sales in the 10 to 25 basis point range each while year-over-year in Q4 fresh food margins were lower by about 80 basis points.","As I mentioned in the last few earnings calls, our investment in pricing occurs throughout many merchandizing departments but has been most notable in fresh foods. Ancillary business gross margins were up 3 basis points year-over-year in Q4. I guess in food court margins coming in a little lower than Q4 last year with others like pharmacy, optical, hearing aids coming a little bit better.","The impact from the increasing executive membership business represented a reduction in gross margin of 2 basis points reflecting the cost of higher penetration of sales going to the executive member reward program. LIFO with the fourth quarter, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax credit this year in the fourth quarter compared to the $11.5 million pre-tax charge last year in the quarter, so that was a year-over-year 7 basis point swing in our favor. All-in-all, a pretty good margin result in the fourth quarter.","Now moving to reported SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q4 over Q4 were higher by 9 basis points coming in at 975 this year compared to a 966 last year. Again, we'll jot down a few numbers. The same four columns; reported and without gas and then again reported and without gas. And the first two columns will be for Q3 year-over-year and the third and fourth columns will be Q4 year-over-year. Going across operations; plus 2 reported in Q3 '13, plus 7 without gas. That means \u2013 plus sign means better or lower. In Q4 it was minus 9 and minus 9.","Central; plus 2 and plus 2 in the columns one and two; plus 3 and plus 3 in columns three and four. RSUs or equity compensation minus 1 and 0 and minus 3 and minus 3. All told, in Q3 year-over-year we reported a plus 3 or SG&A better by 3 basis points. Without gas inflation it was actually better by 9 basis points looking at it that way and again in Q4 year-over-year it was higher or minus 9 basis points.","The core operations component again was 9 basis points year-over-year. There are several moving parts to that. For example, benefits to worker's comp expenses were higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by 5 basis points, 4 in the benefits side and 1 in the worker's comp side. In part due to year-end true-ups of various expense accruals as well as some increases. So again some of that I would say would be more normal, some of it is just how we true-up things at year end.","Several additional basis points of our expense comparisons in Q4 year-over-year resulted from a variety of other year-end expense true-ups that in the aggregate had helped us a little last year in the quarter intended to hurt us a little bit this year in the quarter. These items now withstanding within core operations our payroll as percent of sales continue to improve year-over-year.","Central expense it was better or lower by three basis points as you saw on the chart. This benefited by bringing back a little bit of our bonus accrual for the year. That benefit was somewhat offset by ongoing IT monetization costs. I\u2019m happy to mention also that -- I want to mention also that IT expense as a percent of sales will continue to be, negatively impact the SG&A throughout the upcoming fiscal year as we continue these monetization efforts.","Lastly our equity compensation which has provided us part of a compensation package to more than 3000 people in Costco represented a three basis point hit to SG&A in the quarter. So told there are few other things I think were anomalies and few they were a little higher expense all resulting of course the reported higher SG&A. In terms of the income statement pre-opening expense $15 million last year up $2 million to $17 million this year, no real surprises. Last year we had six openings, four in the U.S. and two international. This year we had seven openings in the quarter, two U.S. and five international.","All told reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased slightly year-over-year, I mean last year at $949 million versus $954 million this year. Again lots of reasons for this, the extra week and many of the items I pointed out earlier in this discussion. Below the operating income line reported interest expense was $14 million higher year-over-year with Q4 \u201913 coming in at $36 million versus $22 million in last years quarter. This difference relates to additional interest expense again in the December 12, $3.5 billion debt offering which equates to about $44 million pre-tax a year and about between $13 million and $14 million for the 16 week quarter.","Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $2 million coming in at $36 million this year from $38 million a year ago. Actual interest income within this figure came in at $14 million compared to $16 million a year ago. The other component of interest income and other amounted to income of about $22 million in each of the fourth quarters; essentially it was same over year-over-year. Overall pre-tax income was down $11 million versus last year's fourth quarter coming in at $954 million this year versus $965 million last year. Again last year's fourth quarter included one more week of earnings results and this year's 16-week fourth quarter.","In terms of income taxes, our Company\u2019s tax rate this quarter came in at 34.8% versus 35.6% a year ago, so a little less about 8\/10th of a percent lower year-over-year tax rate. While many of the items I talked about in expenses tended to go against us in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. There are few discreet items in taxes that tended to help us and reduce that rate a shade from a year-ago. Overall net income was up $8 million versus last year's fourth quarter from $609 million last year to $617 million this fiscal year in the fourth quarter.","Now for a quick renown of other topics, while the finance balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, a couple of balance sheet informational items. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $295 million and therefore $946 million for the entire fiscal year. Merchandize accounts payable, again and then when you look at accounts payable on the balance sheet it includes majority of it is merchandize related, the other component is typically construction related.","So anyway on the balance sheet a reported AP ratio was 100% this year down from 103% just using merchandized accounts payable to inventories, it was 89% down from 90%. Average inventory per warehouse; last year it was $11.7 million per warehouse. This year it was $12.5 million or about $800,000 per warehouse or about 7% up year-over-year. The $800,000 increase is really spread throughout many merchandized departments and overall our inventories regain shape our fiscal inventories at fiscal yearend came in as good as they\u2019ve ever been.","In terms of CapEx, in the first three quarters of this year we spent $488 million, $455 million and $435 million respectively. So in Q4 we spent $705 million not only as it\u2019s more weak in the fiscal quarter but again it's in -- and expect it's related to all the openings we\u2019ve had coming on this fall. So for the total year we spent $2,083,000,000. I\u2019d estimate that our fiscal \u201814 CapEx given the planned 36 openings will be approximately $2.3 million to $2.5 million again the lower end of that range taken account that probably there\u2019s a couple of things that will slip during the period.","Costco Online, currently costco.com which is our U.S. ecommerce, costco.ca and costco.co.uk. For Q4, sales and profits were up over last year even with the extra week last year. Q4 ecommerce sales were up 8%, again if you extrapolated that for the extra week it would have been about 15% normalized. Ecommerce is again a little over 2% of our sales. We re-platform dot com sites; our dot come sites last fall as I mentioned and we also launched the Android and Apple apps during the same time. costco.uk was launched last fall and in this fall we plan to begin ecommerce operations in Mexico.","In terms of expansion, for the year again this assumes that we opened the 36 that I mentioned at in our plan. It would be 14 in the first quarter, two in the second quarter including one which is before calendar yearend that\u2019s how we had the 15 earlier; nine in Q3 and 11 in Q4. So with fiscal \u201913 the 26 we added represented about 4.5% square footage growth. Assuming 36 on a base of 634 this year, that would be 5.5% square footage growth. If you assume that the low end perhaps 30 that would be about 4.7% square footage growth. So something in the 4.5% to 5% -- closer to 5% range should be our expectation this year.","The new locations by country assuming 36 figure, half would be in the U.S, three would be in Canada, seven would be in Asia between four in Korea and three in Japan, five would be in Australia, one in Mexico and two would be in Spain as I mentioned we\u2019d enter in the spring and the fall. As our fourth quarter end some of you asked about square footage. We stood at -- square footage stood at 90,805,000 square feet, an increase year-over-year of 4.5%.","In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.31 a share or $1.24 annualized that was up 13% from the previous $0.275 per share quarterly dividend. This $1.24 annualized dividend represents the total cost to the company of about $541 million and of course these quarterly dividends were in addition to the $7 per share a special dividend which totaled a little over $3 billion that we paid to shareholders back in December of 2012 our fiscal second quarter of \u201913.","The usual supplemental information will be posted on the Costco investor relation site later this morning. And lastly our fiscal \u201914 first quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, 11th of December that will be for the 12-week fourth quarter ending on November 24th.","With that, I will turn it over to Felicia.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","Steve Forbes \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Hey Richard, it's actually Steve Forbes on for John today.","Richard Galanti","Hi.","Steve Forbes \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","When you think about the, I guess the holiday selling season coming up; does the shorter selling season between Thanksgiving at Christmas not matter or does something get done differently from a merchandizing or operational standpoint?","Richard Galanti","It doesn\u2019t matter, I mean every pre-holiday Christmas day is better than a post holiday Christmas day, but overall we\u2019re approaching it the same from an inventory standpoint and it being fairly positive on our buying.","Steve Forbes \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then just on Canada; how are you progressing with the rollout of gas and then I guess who\u2019s our target for the number of locations that offer gas as for the end of next year?","Richard Galanti","I have to -- we are 40 right now. North of 40 right now and my guess is this \u2026","Unidentified Company Representative","Every new building will have a gas station.","Richard Galanti","That every new building will have a gas station, so those three I guess another three to five. So six to eight is my guess on a -- oh here I got the numbers here. Gas in Canada we have 43 currently, at the end of, as this past sundry, and that\u2019s out of 85 total Costco\u2019s in Canada. So, on a base of 43, six to eight would be given expected gas.","Steve Forbes \u2013 Guggenheim Securities","And then just lastly on our cost pressure; actually the competitive environment I guess you mentioned fresh foods, the 80 basis points and so forth. Is there anything else you can give a little additional color on and then I guess how are you -- is there any sense of the return that you're seeing on these investments?","Richard Galanti","Well, keep in mind the return \u2013 I used the example of the rotisserie chicken in the past. We get more positive press out there from keeping that incredible giant chicken at 4.99 and over the last year, year and a half, the underlying poultry price have skyrocketed so we've \u2013 the underlying price has skyrocketed such that there's very little margin on it right now although it looks like there is some relief in terms of where pricing is going over the next few months based on poultry future's cost. It doesn't mean we're raising price, it means that we'll at least make a little margin. But sometimes that's fast and that's what we do. In terms of the competitive environment out there and then from what I see at the every four-week budget meetings from all the regions, it's not easy but it's not \u2013 there's always pockets of something but there's nothing that's changed in the extreme either way.","Steve Forbes - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Thanks and good morning. Can you comment on whether you bought back stock this quarter and what your general thought process is on the buyback at this stage of the game?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, we did not \u2013 I forget to mention that. So for the year we bought very little, about $34 million I think at the very beginning of this year back in September. On a long-term basis we're still positive about the outlook of our company long term and we'll continue to look at it. We report once a quarter and we'll let you know next quarter what we've done or not done this quarter. We did of course do the $3 billion special dividend back in the fall at a time when the stock was showing a lot of strength and so we feel good about the combination too over time and I'm trying to be as coy as possible because I can't give you any direction until we'd let you know a quarter from now.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Understood on that. And just a quick follow-up. On the electronics business, can you give us a sense whether the weakness was volume or price driven and what do you think your market share did during the quarter?","Richard Galanti","Well, it was both. I honestly don't know what others have done. We've been very strong up until the fourth quarter. Like through May, it seemed like every month we had what we call majors which is electronics principally and TVs within, that's the biggest category, tended to be up in the 5 percentage point to 10 percentage point range. A little of that I think back then was higher average price point even though electronics tends to be deflationary, we were selling bigger and bigger and more advanced televisions, 60s and 80s. Back in June, July as we saw some weakness and we shared that with everybody on our monthly sales call, the big effect tended to be \u2013 it was the Olympics a year ago and that's what we've seen so far.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Thanks so much, Rick. I appreciate it.","Richard Galanti","Hold on, one other thing here. The managers are telling us there is a challenge that sales have come down a little bit everywhere. I don't know what others have done.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman, Sachs & Co.","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you talk about how you think about inflation in key categories going forward and does that provide an opportunity for some margin relief such that maybe we can move back to flat core margins? And then related to that, how should we think about the LIFO impact related to that?","Richard Galanti","Okay. Well, first of all, as I've said several times in the last year or two when margins have showed a little year-over-year downturn, in our view it's us more than our competition and we have been pretty extreme on certain categories. I think a year ago was the food court, as I mentioned the rotisserie chicken when you're selling 60 million plus of those a year that adds up to more than a couple of basis points alone for the company. But that's overall what we do. In terms of LIFO and in terms of what does inflation or deflation do? Certainly inflation we tend to \u2013 ultimately you got to take some of it subject to competition but we tend to be laggard historically. With deflation we tend to be the first out of the box. So certainly though when there is inflation, there is perhaps a little bit of opportunity and that gets to the LIFO question, what generally you see is when there's a LIFO credit meaning that there has been deflation, you've also had some price reductions. So part of the reason I think the core year-over-year was down a little is that is well; when it goes the other way they tend to go in opposite directions. Not all the time but that's the case. So I think that we do better when we're reducing prices and driving business and overall that's good for us better than others. We view that we tend to be more aggressive and take more advantage of that to show a difference between us and our competition.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","So does that mean that are you seeing more deflation and do you expect more deflation going forward and would that result in\u2026?","Richard Galanti","Keep in mind we're not seeing a lot of anything right now. I did mention gasoline in general. I mean gasoline is quite deflationary. Year-over-year in the month it was 8% lower but it's kind of \u2013 everything else is kind of neutral certainly well under 1 percentage point. Again, I mentioned poultry as an example that had more to do with the fact that poultry prices had risen dramatically over a couple year period and we've maintained 4.99 price on that which again we find ourselves in the news about that which is a positive. Now that there is some \u2013 it seems like there is some downward pressure on both feed and poultry prices of futures over the next few months as the commitments for the producers go through the higher cost up, we would expect hopefully to see those prices come down which adds to margins and we'll maintain that 4.99.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","So what about \u2013 isn't there pricing on the grain side, isn't that causing pressure? There is some Nielsen data out today suggesting that prices are coming down on the grain side and if you look at corn and soy out there where the price of the market today that would suggest that prices will come down in the future, so are any of the merchants talking about on the dry grocery side or other areas in the box where they expect pricing to come down or is the outlook basically neutral?","Richard Galanti","If our landed cost come down, generally you expect to see our prices come down. I think we have the anomalies or the outliers are going to be something like in extreme light of \u2013 by the way, rotisserie chicken is just one form of chicken we sell. We sell frozen and fresh and everything else but just that one item is $300 million plus. So when we have been the leader in terms of keeping the price down despite very upward increases in underlying costs, as those come down that gives us a little margin relief. But generally speaking across what I'll call this supermarket canned and box categories, we're going to try to lower prices.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Understood. And then any commentary in terms of how September played out from a cadence perspective week-to-week?","Richard Galanti","I don't have that detail in front of me. I mean a lot of it has to do with how Labor Day falls and what the weather is with back-to-school. There's probably a 3% or 4% range between the weeks but I don't have that in front of me.","Christopher Horvers - JPMorgan","Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Just want to touch on a couple of things. First, with regard to competitive pricing, as you know one of your competitors has been out there with a new vendor book program that I think they've done now three or four times. Just curious in your price sensitive organization, how are you dealing with that? Are you matching price when they do a vendor book or do you just set up, do your own vendor book and disregard that as promotional pricing that's not every day?","Richard Galanti","We're going to do what we do. Look, if they keep doing it, it must be working and we've been doing it for a long time ourselves. We're always out there trying to do new things as well and I think that's fine. We take that into account when \u2013 the comments I mentioned earlier about levels of competition out there.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","But I guess just day-to-day when they have a vendor book out there, do you feel compelled to lower the price on those items or do you just treat it as their one-off promotional event that you don't necessarily match?","Richard Galanti","Well, in a perfect world absolutely yes every time. The reality is, is just like on our NVM booklets when we're getting \u2013 we\u2019ve negotiated a specific deal with a specific vendor and its essentially a lower cost to us because of that, but that's because of the deal that we negotiated. We are not going to go way down to match something all the time; we're looking at it as promotional. At the end of the day, all of the big retailers from the biggest to the next three or four and the large supermarket teams as well, all the big manufacturers have various buckets and different silos of promotional monies whether it's for the MBM or slotting allowances or seasonal back to school whatever it is and different retailers going to use it at different times in different ways. So ultimately every day blocking and tackling were going to match prices. We're not going to go crazy 20% below costs for somebody else had used that -- their silo of promotional monies in a way on a promotional basis. As I wouldn't expect they would either.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","And then with regard to Canada I think you guys are a little bit more aggressive in front of target openings, they kind of came out the gate maybe a little bit higher priced than people thought, just kind of curious how you\u2019ve adjusted to that or if you have at all?","Richard Galanti","I would say it has been less of an issue than we had thought. We never thought it would be a huge issue other than the fact that having have a formidable player and they certainly are formidable and respected coming into a market where that would impact promotional activities with Walmart, with Loblaws and others up there that there will be a lot of marketing and excitement and promotional stuff. There has been some, but probably not as much as we had felt. Now we\u2019ve also been held by the fact that we have rolled out things like gas that drives business and the economy overall in Canada has been very strong over the last few years. They have not suffered any economy strains that we have here in the U.S. So maybe you can ask them, but we haven't seen a big deal.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","Have you been able to take price back ups since they weren\u2019t as aggressive or you just stay pretty stable?","Richard Galanti","No, we cannot do that.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","Yes, okay. Last item was just on this other income line, you mentioned $22 million outside of interest income, was that related to like FX gains? I know you\u2019ve that Mexico peso issue against the dollar.","Richard Galanti","It's principally FX gains.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","FX gains? Okay.","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Daniel Binder - Jefferies & Co.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Melich with ISI Group.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Thanks. Richard thanks for the walk through on the membership fee income. I did have a follow-up there. You said that the 3% really sort of gets to 6% if you try and back out the extra week and fee increase, does that also adjust for FX which I presumably would have been a headwind to that year-over-year in the quarter?","Richard Galanti","That would affect it a little more, you're right.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","So that will be another 100 bps, so we just think of it as proportional to the business?","Richard Galanti","It's probably a little less than that, but I should have mentioned it. I always try to find reasons here.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","All right. So that basically in local currency membership fee income might have been up 7% not 6%?","Richard Galanti","It could have been, I just don't -- I need to calculate it out, but yes certain -- something, but I don't know if it\u2019s (indiscernible) that.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","(Indiscernible).","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Then second on SG&A, I just want to make sure I got the nine bps of headwinds that I got that right, the workers comp sounded like most of it was a catch up for maybe under accrual earlier in the year and then there are few other things that you said were true up by year end. Could you summarize of the nine bps, how much of it was true up versus how much of it is actual cost of running the business ongoing?","Richard Galanti","I don't want to get that granular not because the number is worse than I think. Somewhere in the middle it was probably the right answer. They\u2019re literally the two big ones of course are benefits in membership -- benefits in workers comp, which I mentioned was five bps year-over-year. I know within workers comp, first of all, understand what a true up is. You think about workers comp we have just the U.S workers comp well in excess of $100 million of in current expense every year. There is also what we reserve when somebody gets injured or whatever to say it went down on disability, we set a reserve based on what we think. Now to extend it's a bad injury it might be a reserve of tens of thousands, if not a few hundred thousand dollars based in anticipation over several year period.","Every quarter end the actuary -- our actuaries look at that to adjust the -- what's on the balance sheet, if you will, we\u2019ve expensed or reserve already. So on top of that 100 a year of incurring items you are also truing that up at the end of every quarter directly under GAAP accounting. That I think the reserve on our balance sheet at any given time just on workers comp is over $300 million and so a swing of $5 million or $10 million one-way on actuarial changes based on what happened in the last quarter of real expenses and adjusting those things, sometimes it helps you by a few million, sometimes it hurt you by a few million. And there are several large expense pools given our size that we try to be granular to help you understand the numbers, but again if I had to look at last year in Q4, a few more of those moons lined up for us, this year a few of those expense is lined up against us and probably somewhere in the middle of that nine is the right number, I hate to go further than that because I don't know.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","All right. Fair enough. And then lastly on the CapEx, I understand that it\u2019s going up this year with more openings. But how should we think about the number there? Is that number -- because I know you spend money on land and everything well before the opening. So should we think about that number is proportional to a number that might be out there in 2015 or in other words we model it out if we\u2019re going to open 30 or 35 plus a year, is this the run rate we use now or is this year elevated because you're going into Spain and it was like \u2026?","Richard Galanti","I say more of it\u2019s the run rate than one-time elevation. So, I mean, I think something in the 2.3 to 2.5 is a best guess right now.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Right. So that makes sense with this sort of opening level.","Richard Galanti","Right. And again if its 6 or 7 less and we got delayed on a couple of property purchases and we did a little less or more on depots, all of those things add into that. But probably something in the -- something between 2, 2.5 is the right guesstimate for the next few years.","Gregory Melich - ISI Group","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Yes, hi. It\u2019s Jason here. I just wanted to understand a bit more on the membership income in addition to what was shared before. I guess, maybe just looking forward though what kind of -- now that the accrual base is in there and you\u2019ve taken the fee increase and renewal rates are high, I mean what can be done to drive more members per store? Is executive membership going to be a bigger focus now that we've got a couple of years from that the increase? And if you can share anything in terms of the international progress in terms of membership obviously the renewal rates are lower than the U.S., but what could be done there? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, let me -- what I am always be surprised that this the continued increased penetration of executive membership even in countries like the U.S which has been around for 13 or 14 years and Canada which has been around for 10 years. We still -- we do a better job at thing in store of converting people to executive membership both when they -- new sign ups. I remember several years ago, 10 to 15 of every 100 signed up \u2013 existing warehouse in the U.S and Canada signed up as executive membership, now its in the 30s and 40s. Part of that has been a little bit better at just doing that and hopefully it\u2019s as we point that out there, obviously their value.","In terms of driving membership the fact that we\u2019re getting a lot more members in some of these countries like Asia and Australia certainly helps that has a higher percentage of our openings go to those markets. The low renewal rate is -- I remember the first previous even in the U.S back in the mid-80s in and the Canada in the late 80s, signed up a hundred people in the first year to get to that what was awfully down to mature a mid 80 renewal rate would have been great, but of course now its 90. In that second year maybe 70 or 72 or 73 of those 100 signed up. But then a new 100 signed up also in the year three, a higher percentage of that 70 or 72 plus 70 or 72 of the second year\u2019s 100. So it kind of builds over time.","I would say those starting renewal rates in Asia start out a little lower than that 70, sometimes in the 50s or 60s and then go from there. But mind you it's been somewhat of a phenomena where we get a lot of press, very densely populated cities and people coming in from a little further distance in a city -- in cities where it is little harder to travel. So I think all those things have tended to be the reasons why we\u2019re going to keep doing what we do is it relates to driving membership, I think we got better in our marketing activities in what we do. And so I think overall we will keep driving membership the old fashion way in terms of opening newer houses certainly in less penetrated countries that is a bigger help and giving them value. And historically we've tended to raise fees about every five, five and a half years and I can't promise what it will be again but that's what it's been for 30 years.","Jason DeRise - UBS","In terms of the age of the stores in the international market and the maturity process there are obviously writing, you're talking about adding new stores and new countries even. Is there anything in the cadence of that that we should think about in terms of if we're modeling on a member per store basis on a year-over-year basis if there's anything that you can share there for the coming year or so compared to prior years?","Richard Galanti","It tends to be higher internationally. I think when we opened in Australia we got off to an incredible start, our highest per share volumes ever in a country. Again, I think people around the world know what our membership club is and we get a lot more press when we go into a country. We've had outsized members and it helps when you got five or six locations in a 20 million population city and it's getting to press. And so I think \u2013 given the size of our whole company and the fact that still 70% of our company is in the U.S. and another 10% or 12% is in Canada that yes, the international keeps moving the needle but it moves it a little upward.","Jason DeRise - UBS","And maybe just to wrap up my line of questioning on the member fees, so talking about 6% is the clean number, maybe something closer to 7% really clean for FX for the way that it grew in the fourth quarter. How would you consider that as a run rate and with the new store openings, do you think it could be better than that or do you think that \u2013 I guess I'm going to let you answer how you think about that?","Richard Galanti","Yes. We're going to try but I think that \u2013 again, something plus or minus a couple of percentage points from that is probably a best guess at this point. Mind you also there's deferred accountings, so when \u2013 I've shared examples when we open a new unit in the United States membership sign ups as of opening day which tends to be the eight or 12-week period prior to opening day, through opening day because you've got tabling activities there where people can come in and sign up once the parking lot you can get in and out of. And in the best markets in the U.S., Northern Cal, Southern Cal, Seattle, when we open a new unit it's a no-brainer success story that you might only have 5,000 to 8,000 sign ups or 4,000 to 8,000 sign ups because a lot of people were already members, they're going to come more frequently because we have \u2013 we're closer to them. When you open in some of these countries you might have 20,000 to 40,000 new signs ups through opening day. Now even that's the case it takes a year for that to get into the system based on deferred accounting because it's basically you book that annual fee one-twelfth a month. So I think it will trend in there over time but on a base of 635 or 640 locations, an extra few locations internationally again it moves the needle in the right direction as it relates to this question but it's not a giant mover.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Thanks. Good morning, Richard. As part of these modernization efforts that you talked about, when you look at your membership fee data base, is there any thought internally to start data mining some of the consumer information that you have and begin more personalized couponing or targeted promotions versus the standard 3.5 week MBMs that you're currently doing?","Richard Galanti","I would say we're closer than we've ever been but it's still going to be a while. One of the modernization things that we're doing is rewriting the membership system. Let's start with some of the basics. The extreme examples last year when we replatformed a dot.com a year ago, prior to that the search engines couldn't even crawl on the site so you'd never Google us and see Costco.com. And now I guess and that is the membership and the data mining. I think that Craig has shown a little openness to our marketing people but we're not going to go crazy quickly for us, but there's some opportunity there. But again, as we do some things we'll let you know like we did with dot.com.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, fair enough. And then just to fall back on Matt's question on the balance sheet and with $14 per share in cash and then adjusted the EBITDA ratio one of lowest in retail, what's the Board waiting to see before you guys get more aggressive on the buyback? I get last year with the big dividend kind of holding back on the buyback but what are you guys waiting to see to get more aggressive?","Richard Galanti","Well, stay tuned to 12 weeks from now when we talk to you. We'll let you know. I mean again I think we view our runway, if you will, long term that we've got a lot of opportunity. We certainly \u2013 I agree with you even with the risk of CapEx we have a strong balance sheet and we'll continue to talk at our quarterly Board meetings, but I really can't say a whole lot more than that at this point.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay. And then I know your purpose when the K comes up, but do you have the U.S., Canada and international margins for the fiscal year of 2013?","Richard Galanti","I don't think I can give that to you unless it goes out publicly from an 8-K standpoint. Next Wednesday is our plan to send out the K.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, great. And then on the 80 basis points and pressures in the 10 to 25 up in the three areas, could you just give us a little bit of perspective how that compared to the last quarter?","Richard Galanti","Why don't we go to the next question and then I'll answer it. I think I did talk about it in the last earnings call which I have in front of me, so we'll go to the next question and I can answer that.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay. And just a follow-up on Chris' question earlier with regards to that price investment. It appears that you guys weren't really necessarily offensive, it was more of a defense. I mean the fact that your costs were going up and so you were keeping rotisserie chicken prices at the 4.99, is that fair to say the large chunk of why you saw the margin pressure in fresh foods?","Richard Galanti","No, that was the outsized component of it but there were a few other items within fresh foods as well.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, great.","Richard Galanti","Back to your other question, I did find what I said a quarter ago. The four core categories \u2013 this is in Q3 of '13, the four core categories; food and sundries, hardlines, softlines and fresh foods each showed lower year-over-year gross margin percentages, so that compares to what I mentioned this quarter that food and sundries, hardlines, softlines being up year-over-year. All four of those subcategories were low year-over-year in Q3.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee & Leach","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.","Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Hi, Richard. I wanted to know whether Costco is giving consideration to having its employees enter healthcare exchanges, going to kind of a defined contribution, if you will. And additionally, if you can give us some color on the rising healthcare costs and is it likely we'll see that continuing to run ahead of sales?","Richard Galanti","First of all we have no plans to change what we currently do. As it relates to continuing to rise, the answer is probably yes. We have made a few tweaks to our plan to try to \u2013 have the participants in the plan make more thoughtful decisions on a few things and made some very other, very small changes which maybe it brings down the rate a little bit. In each of the last three years, part of the Affordable Care Act as it is transitioning in we estimate was about 1 to 1.5 percentage points of increase each year, so even when we showed in 11 let's say or 11.5 a couple of years ago year-over-year, that 11.5 included 1.5 from affordable care incrementally. And I think this is the last year of a few of those transition items that are going in. An example would be you have to have the same limit, lifetime limit irrespective of the plan and we had a different lifetime limit for part time and full time plans.","We opted \u2013 as you would expect us to do we opted to the higher limit for both. And so there's things like that that's part of those 1% and 1.5% growth items on a sizable number to start with. I would guess whatever it would have been it'd be a little less because of one, these annual pieces that have gone into the Affordable Care Act that are transitioning over three or four years now, I think this is the last year of that as it relates to what we know now, but I've read some articles that they seem cost come down and when I talk to a few others of different industries, they don't see it a lot of low inflation there either. So I don't know where those reports are coming from. But I would guess it\u2019s a little lower than it\u2019s run? Yes. It's a lot lower now.","The other thing that I think helps us on a global basis is, is the members I\u2019m talking about here are U.S. We have a lot lower experience at these costs in all other countries because in most cases it's nationalized healthcare and in controlled -- expense controlled quite a bit better as it relates to lower. And as an increasing percentage comes from outside the U.S. that helps us; and we get a little help from the fact that as we ramp up expansion for you to be covered in our healthcare it takes three to six months based on full time and part time. The fact that we\u2019re opening more units now means that there\u2019ll be a few more people and but again that\u2019s on a very large basis, so that tweaks it down a little bit, but not a lot.","Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","On that dementia, I know when in your past as your employee turnover came down, that I think added to the rate of healthcare costs. What is the kind of employer retention year-on-year and is that a factor here too?","Richard Galanti","It's still very low. It did come down and a lot of that had to do I think when the economy hit hard and it means that economy hasn\u2019t improved greatly. I think then probably our retention rates of employees has continued at a low good rate in our view, because we have -- we drew -- we have a good compensation and benefits package, and it's tough out there. And so it's, I think our renewal rate overall in the U.S. is about 11%, those numbers are most familiar with and after a year it's 6% I believe. And that\u2019s pretty much about how low. I think there\u2019ll be a 11% -- might have been a 10% a year or two ago, a (indiscernible) It can be off five percentage point here, but that\u2019s pretty where its been.","Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","Okay. And a separate question; do your buyers see much ability to trade the consumer up, I mean really the average ticket is kind of moving with inflation, it seems like at this point but I mean are you -- as you\u2019re planning for the holiday do you think you\u2019ve got any ability to move it up usually with the upper end comp consumer showing some strength in consumer confidence at least up until recently you\u2019ve been able to do that, what's the outlook now?","Richard Galanti","Well we keep trying and we keep -- I think we keep being successful. By the way, while the average ticket has moved as you suggested with inflation maybe a little more or less depending on the quarter that\u2019s now stating the fact that we\u2019ve had four plus percent sharper frequency for five years compounding now. So, which compared to 1%, 1.5% compounding for the each of the 20 years before that. So I think that in part tends to put downward pressure on that number. So we\u2019re actually kind of pleased that it's held up where it is given that increase of frequency. Also in new markets it's a lower number to start with. And so that all goes into that weighted average as well. So I think overall our number is holding up pretty well. And look and mind you as merchants we\u2019re always trying to upgrade the product. We want to save a member money, but on the best item and the biggest quantity as you might expect that we do and so always trying to drive that and sometimes that\u2019s because we can drive more value that way particularly on very competitive items.","Mark Miller - William Blair & Company, L.L.C.","All right. Thanks, Richard.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Good morning, Richard. Regarding the venture into Spain anything you would point out about those clubs that will be different from some of the others?","Richard Galanti","Nothing really. Yeah, it will be -- it looks like warehouse. I think the one thing is that they\u2019ll be on one floor as you know in several of the very densely populated cities in Asia and even in Sydney we\u2019ve got some double deck retail facilities with two and three decks of parking on top of that or below that. In Spain our plan is to be on one level so far but that we could have over time but the first one will be on across.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And the size is in inline with the corporate average?","Richard Galanti","Yes. The size is in line with the corporate average of new locations. I think our average per warehouse is about 144, 143. We tend to build things in the 155 range.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Got you. And the real estate pipeline is ready for additional international expansion is that why we\u2019re seeing this nice step up here in the new openings?","Richard Galanti","Yeah, I mean I think the pipeline has been built over the last couple of years there. If you go back four, five years ago there were a few if any real estate people on the ground in many of these countries. Now there are people on the ground in every country and that\u2019s been for the last couple of years. And so, yes the pipeline is full but it's never any easier, sometimes when you look out at dates in these cities it has planned opening in 2016 if everything goes well, and sometimes a lot sooner. But the fact is, is it's certainly harder than some of the smaller cities in the United States.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","What would you -- how would you rate the prospects for additional new countries in Europe?","Richard Galanti","Well I think we talked about going likely into two countries, one in \u201914 and one in \u201915, and beyond that we\u2019ll see.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","And finally can you give us what the gasoline sales were in fiscal 2013?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know if I have that in front of me. We\u2019ll go to the next question and I have somebody looking at that one.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys how you doing? It's actually Matt for Paul. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about SG&A. I know you kind of ran through healthcare as an issue and some of the other things you\u2019re facing with the technology investment, but with your payroll, your payrolls are getting better as a percentage of cost, how would we think about SG&A kind of for the remainder of the year? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Well, look we keep trying to bring it down, but we\u2019re not going to bring it down. We have our own constraints on certain aspects of that life. We\u2019re going to still do top of scale increases for our two thirds of our hourly employees that are top of scale. We\u2019re going to not cut back which we could easily do on certain healthcare aspects. So we\u2019re going to do the things that we\u2019ve always done. We\u2019re going to do it first and foremost by trying to drive sales. Gas -- by the way gas deflation does hurt you a little bit. When there is inflating gas it's a very low gross margin business but it's an even lower thankfully SG&A -- low SG&A business. So when you\u2019ve got a big gas inflation that seems to hurt your margin a little bit and help your SG&A conversely the other way. So, given that gas was 8% deflation in September if that continued to the next couple of months I\u2019ll be showing you that second column again for margin in SG&A, but that hurts it a little bit when it's deflationary. The thing that\u2019s going to help it first and foremost is top line sales growth and secondly is lower -- ultimately lower structural SG&A in several of these other countries so far that we\u2019re currently in like Asia, Mexico, frankly Australia.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, thanks. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard just on Asia I think you talked to -- you said there was cannibalization in Asia and I just wonder how you think about cannibalization in Asia going forward given the high productivity in those clubs?","Richard Galanti","We want to get more open faster even if it's a little hurtful -- even if it's a little hurtful to cannibalization. Mind you, you\u2019re going from five to six locations in a 20 million population city you might have some cannibalization, but we\u2019ve been blessed by having some units that are $250 million, the 300 plus million dollars in some cities in Taiwan, in Korea and Japan where we opened the second unit, you\u2019ll take $50 million to $75 million of that $300 million away and the only thing that goes into your comp is that negative $50 million or $75 million for that first year, but come second year you\u2019ve got two units that are going nicely, and so that\u2019s part of the business.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","And typically in the second year or in the third year you usually start to see that first unit rebuild, is that been your experience so far or?","Richard Galanti","We really see the 53rd week out, I mean once that impact -- that cannibalizing impact anniversaries is when you\u2019ll see that rebound.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","So almost immediately after you get to that second year. Secondly and just lastly for me, I know in the States we\u2019re all thinking about the government shutdown and just interested to how the management thinks about that impact going on your business and if there\u2019s anything strategic you\u2019re doing because of it?","Richard Galanti","Other than scratching our head in disbelief \u2026","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","We\u2019re all getting bald doing that.","Richard Galanti","I actually told our senior executives in operations, on the west coast there is really not seen any effect. Around D.C. is the only place where we\u2019ve seen some effect downward a little bit.","Budd Bugatch - Raymond James","Okay. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Yes, hi. Good morning, guys. Wanted to go back to the SG&A again, I had a couple of questions. Just talking to the people this morning about with the 5% comp why not get it -- couldn't you get a little bit more leverage? I know there were some incremental expense, it sounds like some true ups things like that, but should SG&A had a little more leverage or what -- how should we think about it going forward I guess?","Richard Galanti","I think the two biggest things are the fact that, again given our size and given even our $30 billion sales number for the quarter, $3 million which isn't what it used to be when you are doing a $100 billion a year. $3 million of anything is a basis point swing. When you\u2019ve got just a similar example of workers comp where you\u2019re adjusting every quarter as you do it for GAAP accounting, actuarially a $300 million plus tale of previous years of workers\u2019 comp issues. You have got a much bigger number adjusting in healthcare; you have got lots of other expenses.","So I think it\u2019s a combination of several of those lining up in one direction instead of some of them offsetting. There is always going to be a range. Usually you have got half one way and half the other. We will see what else was there. The fact that we\u2019ve 17 versus 16 weeks hurt you a little bit. Again, my guess is at the end of the day, you \u2013 we\u2019ve some increased expansion efforts with opening in Spain and IT monetization that's a few basis points. So all of those things add up.","I think at the end of the day what I was trying to convey when we look at all the numbers it's nine over stated kind of the underlying secular trend. But I don\u2019t want to suggest it was zero, it was probably somewhere north of zero and south of five, but I don't know what the number is.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for that. And then just another question, as far as holiday season goes, any changes to how you\u2019re approaching this year versus last year, opening closing, different times of events, anything like that we should think about?","Richard Galanti","Nothing.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Okay. And then the one last thing I wanted to ask you guys was just -- I know you give us the monthly trends, so we kind of know where things are at. But I want to ask anyway, any changes in sort of purchasing habits from the core consumer in terms of surprises, when you\u2019ve -- maybe launched the new -- some of those special items that you\u2019ve that things either sold better or worse or than you may have expected and the way people are purchasing. Do you have anything to comment on?","Richard Galanti","I think we -- I continue to be pleasantly surprised and happy that our frequency is where it is with [four in] front of it. Recognizing some of that gas expansion in Canada some of its new markets where we opened new units, but overall no.","Joe Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group","Okay. Thanks guys. Good luck for this quarter.","Richard Galanti","Why don\u2019t we take two last questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of (indiscernible) with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask how you do think small business owners are feeling right now. What\u2019s the sentiment that you are perceiving?","Richard Galanti","Well, I\u2019m not in a kind of -- we haven\u2019t seen a big change in our small business members in terms of their sales trends. So it\u2019s hard to say. I can\u2019t really answer that one.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Hey guys, thanks for slipping me in and I know a lot of questions have been asked. So I just wanted to talk about the magnitude of the price investments in Fresh Food next year, I guess, it could vary to some degree on what happened competitively -- from what you can control, do you anticipate a continuation of the trend there?","Richard Galanti","Well, I can\u2019t really give you any direction going forward other than -- we\u2019re going to be aggressive, it\u2019s in our blood. Again, good news is that to the extent that certain commodity prices are coming down. We kept our prices down when commodity -- those underlying raw material costs skyrocketed. Now that they\u2019re coming back, its \u2013 it hopefully will give us a fair -- a fairer margin in some of those areas where we have really hit ourselves hard, and so hopefully -- under that scenario that's -- they\u2019re positive to margin. But we\u2019re going to keep doing what we\u2019re doing in terms of being aggressive and I do want to say while we certainly aren\u2019t cavalier about our competition, we think our toughest competitor is ourselves and we\u2019re going to keep driving that.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","So just to clarify if I heard you right, that you\u2019re going to be pretty aggressive, but -- and we\u2019ve noted this in our research as a chance that the wholesale prices could come down faster than have as a retail. So you actually think it could be a potentially net benefit given that dynamic, is that a good read of what you were saying?","Richard Galanti","Potentially and again I\u2019m using a data sample of one item here to check in. Certainly just few other a lot of those in fresh foods are like that because if you recall a few years ago, we were talking about food court margins got hammered, because the cost of cheese skyrocketed and needless to say we sell a lot of pizza. And so -- but we gave that as an anecdotal example of where we\u2019re going to hold the pricing though, because it\u2019s such a value proposition. And so there are few of those. On general merchandise, subject to competitive challenges out there, it rains on all of us -- all the competition out there and when underlying costs are coming down a little bit, there is -- if there is pressure out there we probably are more of it than others, but a little of it we will retain.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Okay. Richard, thank you for taking my questions. I appreciate it.","Richard Galanti","Sure. Okay, before we hang it up here, were Bob and Jeff and I are in a budget meeting -- monthly budget meeting till about one, so we will take calls after that if you have any questions or shoot us an email. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Brandy and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO, sir, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Brandy, and good morning to everyone. This morning\u2019s press release reviews our first quarter of fiscal 2016 operating results for the 12-weeks ended November 22.","Before I begin, please note that these discussions will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements address risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today\u2019s call, as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company\u2019s public statements and reports filed with the SEC. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and we do not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","To begin with our 12-week first quarter of fiscal 2016, for the quarter, our reported earnings per share came in at $1.09, $0.03 below last year\u2019s reported figure of $1.12. There are several items of note, six to be exact, that impacted this year over year comparison of Q1 earnings.","First, FX in the first quarter, the foreign currencies where we operate were weaker year over year versus the US dollar, primarily in Canada, Mexico and Korea, such that foreign earnings in Q1 when converted into US dollars for reporting purposes were lower by approximately $42 million, or $0.10 a share, than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year over year.","The big weaknesses started about a year ago, while I certainly don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen tomorrow and there\u2019s been continued weakness, certainly the biggest impacts looks like the last four quarters. One of the benefits, of course, is purchasing land and building units in some of these countries was little cheaper over the last year.","Number two, stock compensation expense was $36 million higher year over year in the first quarter or $0.05 a share. We have over 4,600 people who receive restricted stock units. For many of them, it is a significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October in our fiscal first quarter.","While these grants typically vest over a five-year period, accelerated vesting occurs when a recipient reaches 25, 30 and 35 years of employment with the company. So factors driving this $36 million increase included additional levels of accelerated vesting given the rising number of employees achieving long tenure with the company. This, by the way, is most impactful each Q1, given our October RSU grant cycle.","Two, appreciation in our stock price and of course the larger number of employees in the plants. I\u2019d like to note that because of the significant price appreciation in our stock this past year, this year\u2019s annual RSU grant, which occurred in late October, was reduced by an average of 12%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient.","So while there was a $36 million year over year increase in Q1, in the upcoming second, third and fourth quarters of this fiscal year, the anticipated year over year increases are estimated to be about a third of this dollar amount in each of the fiscal quarters. So $0.01 to $0.02 earnings year over year impact each quarter in second, third and fourth quarters versus the $0.05 a share impact in Q1.","Third point I\u2019d like to note, there are two SG&A items that together negatively impacted this year\u2019s Q1 earnings. In the first quarter, we recorded a $22 million charge related to two non-recurring legal and regulatory matters. The $22 million figure represented an 8 basis point to SG&A and impacted our first quarter earnings per share by $0.04.","Point number four, IT modernization, as discussed in each of the past many quarters over a couple of years now, our major IT modernization efforts continue to impact our SG&A expense percentages, especially as new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter, on an incremental year over year basis, these costs impacted SG&A by an estimated $20 million pre-tax, or 7 basis points, 6 basis points without gas deflation which is about $0.03 hit to earnings in the quarter versus last year.","Point number five, last year in the first quarter, we did call out that we had a $17 million benefit to gross margin related to a non-recurring legal settlement. So that benefited last year\u2019s first quarter by $0.03 a share.","And lastly, point number six, our cobranded credit card transition in the US. As you know, when we transition into a new cobranded credit card relationship in the US next year, as we wind down our current relationship, new cobrand signups have greatly slowed and in fact are for now ceased. The short term negative impact related to moneys we earn for new cobrand signups.","Year over year in Q1, this represented a $15 million or $0.02 per share hit to our earnings. This will continue to be a small negative impact to earnings in Q2 and Q3 and possibly into Q4 based on timing, at which time I\u2019ll be able to better outline how the new relationships should directionally impact our future results and the future rewards to our members under the new cobranded credit card program.","I look forward to sharing more information at that time. So six items of note, adding it up, it\u2019s about $0.27 of impact to our year over year earnings comparison. I know many of these things you may have in your numbers; I know some of them you don\u2019t.","Turning to our first quarter sales, in terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figure for Q1 showed a minus 1% decrease, plus 2% in the US, minus 9% in Canada and minus 5% in other international. As we stated in our release, if you take out the two big impacts of gas price deflation year over year and the impact of negative FX, the plus 2% reported US comp would have been a plus 6% in the first quarter, the minus 9% in Canada would have been a plus 9% and the minus 5% other international would have been a plus 7%, such that the minus 1% reported comp would have been a plus 6%.","And as we reported last Wednesday in our November sales results for the 4-week month ended November 29, our comp sales increase excluding the impact of FX and gas was similar to the 12-week first fiscal quarter, with total company comp increase of 6% and again ex gas and FX in the US of plus 6%, in Canada a plus 8%, in other international a plus 7%.","In terms of opening activities and plans, we opened 13 new locations in Q1, including two relos, for a net of 11 new warehouses during the quarter which ended November 22. That included seven in the US, one in Canada, one in Australia our 8th in that country, one in Japan, our 24th in Japan, and our second in Spain, just outside of Madrid, in Getafe. That\u2019s our second unit in Spain. Two relocations were in Woodland Hills, California and Teterboro, New Jersey.","In the second quarter, we had two new business centers planned to open, one each in Westminster, California and in Hackensack, New Jersey. And for all of fiscal 2016, we have a current plan to open up 32 net new locations. That could come down a little bit based on timing as we get into the second half of the year, a few may be delayed, but that\u2019s our current plan. Of those, assuming we\u2019re able to do all 32, 22 of them would be in the US, three in Canada, two each in Japan and Australia, and one each in the UK, Taiwan and Spain.","Later in the call, I\u2019ll review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about gross margin and SG&A in Q1 and recent stock purchase activities.","Again, very briefly, sales for the quarter in reported were up 1.3% to $26.6 billion, up from $26.3 billion a year ago. Again, on a comp basis, reported number was down 1%, but ex gas and FX was up 6%. For the quarter, our minus 1% reported comp sales results were a combination of an average transaction size down 4% for the quarter. Again, taking out gas and FX, it would be up 3% excluding those items and an average shopping frequency of about 3.5% for the quarter.","In terms of sales comparison by geography, geographically for Q1, the better operating performing regions in the US were all three regions in California and the Midwest as well. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing countries were Australia, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada.","In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, during the quarter, which we look at September, October and November, excluding FX and gas, within food and sundries, which were up in the mid single digits year over year, sundries, [meat] [ph] deli and spirits were the relative standouts.","Our hard lines sales were up in the mid to high single digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics came in positive first quarter in the low double digit range. In addition to electronics, better performing departments included hardware and garden and patio. Within the mid single digit soft line comps, domestics, women\u2019s apparel and home furnishings were standouts. And in fresh foods where our comp sales were in the mid to high single digits, produce was at the top of the four sub-categories.","Moving down to line items on the income statement, membership fees, in the first quarter membership fees were up 2% \u2013 2 basis points up $11 million, coming in at $593 million versus $582 million a year ago. Again without FX, the dollars would have been up 6%.","I noticed in several of the preliminary notes from some of the sell-side analysts out there, they had expressed some questions about the strength in membership and I might point out a couple of things. In addition to being up 6% ex FX, on a cash basis, there was about another percentage point higher than these numbers as well anecdotally a year ago we did a couple of things outside with social media which we didn\u2019t do, small impact year over year, but something versus nothing.","In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from good signups in existing and new locations, continued increasing penetration of our $110 a year executive membership and strong renewal rates, averaging up to 91% in the US and Canada and averaging up to 88% worldwide. Our new membership signups in Q1 year over year company-wide were up 7%.","In terms of members at Q1 end, gold star came in quarter end at 34.7 million, up from 34.0 million at year-end. Primary business, 7.2 million at quarter end versus 7.1 million a quarter ago. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million. So total memberships, 45.4 million at quarter end, up from 44.6 million and including extra cards, 82.7 million cards out there versus 81.3 million 12-weeks earlier.","At Q1 end, paid executive memberships came in at 16.4 million, which was an increase of 307,000 or 26,000 new executive members increase each week in the 12-week fiscal first quarter. As you know, executive members are over a third of our member base and over two-thirds of our sales in those countries where executive membership is available.","In terms of renewal rates, in the US and Canada, at quarter end, we were at 90.6%, rounded up to 90.6%. We rounded down to 90.5% at the end of Q1, that\u2019s the impact that I mentioned a quarter ago in Canada with having to re-signup the members with a new credit card program, a de novo program. That was a small impact. I think there was [indiscernible] in the US, perhaps based on what I said earlier. Total worldwide remained at 87.8% at quarter end and at fiscal year end.","Going down to gross margin line, our reported gross margin in the quarter was up 26 basis points, coming in at 11.29%, up from 11.03%. As you know, gas deflation is a big impact to these figures, so I\u2019ll give you a couple of numbers, I\u2019ll ask you to write down the normal four columns. For all of fiscal 2015, columns one and two would be reported and then without gas deflation and then two columns for Q1 [indiscernible] reported without gas deflation. And of course, these basis points figures are the year over year change from a year ago.","Merchandise core reported was plus 11 basis points for all of fiscal 2015, but without gas deflation was minus 12 basis points year over year. For Q1, it was plus 24 basis points and minus 3 basis points. Ancillary businesses, for the year, plus 29 basis points and plus 23 basis points. For the quarter, plus 11 basis points and plus 4 basis points. The 2% reward, minus 4 basis points and minus 2 basis points. And for the quarter, minus 3 basis points and minus 1 basis points. LIFO for all of last year was at a 5 basis point pick up both for reported and without deflation and for the quarter was plus 1 basis point and plus 1 basis point.","Other, for the whole of last year, plus 2 basis points reported and plus 1 basis point without gas deflation. And this year that nonrecurring legal settlement impacted \u2013 benefit in gross margin a year ago such that it was minus 7 basis points reported and minus 7 basis points without gas deflation.","End of those columns for all of fiscal 2015 reported gross margin was up 43 basis points, but up 15 basis points ex gas deflation. This year Q1 reported up 26 basis points, but without gas deflation minus 6 basis points, with minus 7 basis points of that minus basis points be the one-time benefit a year ago. So again, overall, those are the numbers.","In terms of the core gross margins which is the core business, food and sundries, hard lines, soft lines and fresh foods, as a percent of their own sales, they were positive year over year in Q1 by 13 basis points and they were higher year over year across all four of these merchandise categories, with both hard lines and soft lines showing stronger year over year improvement than the year over year improvement in food and sundries and fresh foods. But nonetheless, all four were positive year over year.","Ancillary and other business gross margin was up 11 on a reported basis, up 4 without gas deflation in the quarter. Many of these businesses, gas, pharmacy, food [indiscernible] all showed higher year over year gross margins as a percent of their own sales. Offsetting this a little was slightly lower e-commerce gross margins, but overall positive there.","The 2% reward was higher year over year due to higher sales penetrations for executive members. This impacted gross margin in Q1 by 3 basis points to the negative, 1 basis point to the negative ex gas. LIFO, last year at Q1, we had a $2 million credit representing slight deflation in the US inventory pools and a credit of $5 million this year, also relatively small, but in that pick up of a basis point year over year in terms of that recovery.","Lastly, I mentioned, the quarterly adjustment, a 7 basis point hit in terms of the comparison benefiting a non-recurring benefit last year versus nothing this year. So overall, gross margins excluding gas were down 6 basis points year over year, but up 1 basis point excluding that one-year charge, that non-recurring benefit from last year.","Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentages Q1 over Q1 were higher by 28 basis points, coming in at 10.54% this year versus 10.26% last year. But excluding gas deflation, were lower or better by 2 basis points. I\u2019ll go into some details and you\u2019ll see that the core expense components of that actually were pretty good.","So again four columns, columns one and two would be fiscal 2015 year reported and without gas deflation and then columns three and four would be Q1 2016 reported and without gas deflation. First line item, core operations, minus 6 reported and plus 16 without deflation for all of last year on a year over year basis.","In Q1, 0 and plus 26. Central, minus 7 and minus 5 for the year and minus 8 and minus 6 for the quarter. Stock compensation, minus 5 and 4 for the year and minus 12 and minus 10 for the quarter. Quarterly adjustments, nothing last year in columns one and two. This year, minus 8 and minus 8, that represents that $22 million item that I mentioned early on. So total, last year for the year over year we reported SG&A up or minus 18 basis points. And without gas deflation, better or lower, so plus 7 basis points. This year, higher by 28, so minus 28 basis points in the quarter reported and without deflation plus 2.","Within operations, again without deflation, showed plus 26 or lower by 26. Within that, our core warehouse payroll was better year over year in the mid to high single digits, benefits were lower or better in the high single digits and the combination of other expenses, a variety of them, were better by or lower by 10 basis points year over year. So again, it\u2019s kind of the core control of our operating expenses were all in pretty good shape this quarter.","Central expense was higher year over year by minus 8 or minus 6 basis points without gas. As I mentioned earlier in the call, increased IT spending related to modernization showed higher year over year costs of 7 basis points, 6 without gas deflation.","I already mentioned earlier the stock compensation which was 12 basis points or 10 basis points without deflation. I also mentioned that again because of certainly the stock price increase, but also importantly the fact that there is more employees hitting 25 and in some cases 30, in a few cases 35 [indiscernible] the total impact for the year, more than half of it based on our estimates is the impact in Q1 with about a third or less of that amount in each of the coming three quarters year over year, so still it\u2019s going to be higher year over year, but not as high that increase was in Q1.","Finally, quarterly adjustments, again related to the $22 million non-recurring legal and regulatory items that I discussed, so overall good expense control, there\u2019s plenty of things and hopefully I\u2019ve been able to elaborate to shed some light on the components of that.","Moving down the income statement, pre-opening expense was higher by $11 million or 4 basis points higher. We had nine openings last year, including one relocation; 13 this year including two. There\u2019s other pre-opening items in terms of countries and some other things, but overall no big surprises there. Our total reported operating income in Q1 was down $3 million from $770 million last year to $767 million this year.","Below operating income, reported interest expense in Q1 came in at $33 million versus $26 million a year ago, so lower by $7 million. Interest income itself was lower year over year by about $4 million and the other component was lower by $3 million year over year, that\u2019s primarily related to various FX related transactions. Sometime that\u2019s a positive, sometimes that\u2019s a negative, never that meaningful for the year in its entirety generally.","Overall, reported pretax income was down 2% versus last year, coming in at $762 million, down from $779 million pre-tax a year ago. Again, several items impact the year over year earnings comparison which I discussed earlier in the call.","In terms of tax rate, our corporate tax rate this quarter was up about a percentage point, coming in at 36.1% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter rate of 35.2%. The higher tax rate year over year resulted from a few discrete items going to the increasing tax rate not reducing it and to a little extent lower earnings penetration from our foreign country operations where tax rates are generally lower than our income tax rates for the United States.","Now, for a quick rundown of other topics, the balance sheet as in the recent past is included in today\u2019s press. I\u2019ll point out a couple of items. Depreciation and amortization for Q1 came in at $271 million. Accounts payable as a percent of inventory on a reported basis was pretty much the same year over year, last year it was 101%, this year 100%. Taking out non-merchandise payables, last year in non-merchandise payables as a percent of inventories was 92%, this year at quarter end it was 90%.","Average inventory per warehouse on a reported basis was up a little over 3% or $524,000 to $14.9 million. Again, ex FX, it would have been up about 6.5% or $960,000, assuming flat FX. About $250,000 million is electronics and what we call majors and about $160,000 is apparel, both built up inventory heading into the Thanksgiving week, Black Friday and Cyber Monday.","As you could have extrapolated from our number, our November reporting, where we reported the four weeks of November, the 12-week first quarter and the 13-week retail reporting calendar [454] the implication there of course was that the last week which is really the first week of Q2, which is Thanksgiving week, was pretty strong.","The balance of the departments have been selling well, like hardware, housewares and toys, so really no issues in inventory levels going into the last few weeks before calendar year end. We\u2019re in pretty good shape.","In terms of CapEx, in Q1, we spent a little over $700 million and our estimate for the year is to be \u2013 most likely CapEx would be high $2 billions, say $2.8 billion and $3 billion. This compares to CapEx last fiscal year of $2.4 billion.","In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend continues at $0.40 a share, or $1.60 annualized. This represents a total annual cost to the company of around $700 million. In terms of stock buybacks, in Q1, we bought back a total of 898,000 shares for $130 million at an average price of $144.88.","Next topic, Costco online, we\u2019re now in five countries, having launched Korea November 10. We\u2019re in the US, Canada, UK, Mexico and Korea. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce total sales were up 15% on a comp basis, a total and comp basis, up 19% on a comp basis excluding FX. And again, it represents a little over 3% of our sales.","We\u2019ve been asked a lot of how, again, the week of Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you name it, e-commerce sales were quite strong, up 28% and up over 30% in local currencies.","New initiatives, again, it was few years ago that we re-platformed the site. We\u2019ve continued to improve our mobile apps and there\u2019s room to [indiscernible] efforts with our inline efforts. We\u2019ve added a few categories like apparel, hard line, KS items. We\u2019ve greatly improved timing of shipments by shipping out more than just one depot across the country. And again, we\u2019ll expect to see e-commerce and other international markets in the future.","In terms of some of the others out there that are buying from us, we continue to provide merchandise for sale on the Google Shopping Express. This is now being offered in six markets, Bay Area has recently been expanded, LA, Manhattan, and more recently Chicago, DC and Boston. We\u2019ve increased our offerings in categories and currently testing fresh foods available in a limited group in each of the San Francisco and LA markets.","We\u2019re also providing merchandise to Instacart now in 16 markets throughout the United States, Boxt in three markets and we\u2019re also doing some business with Jet.com in the three cities where they have their distribution centers. Outside of here, Alibaba Tmall, we currently offer just over 200 SKUs on the Tmall site, with a heavy emphasis on Kirkland Signature items. It\u2019s going well and we\u2019re certainly building some recognition for the cost going to Kirkland Signature names. We had a very successful Singles\u2019 Day on Alibaba Tmall receiving over 300,000 orders.","Next on discussion, expansion, again, last year opened net new units of 23, so about 3.5% square footage growth. This year, again, plans for up to 32 units. If we achieve that, it\u2019d be about 5% square footage growth and I already mentioned where those would be. Also as of Q1 end, some of you want to know what our square footage is, at Q1 end, it stood at 1,547,000 square feet.","Lastly, our second quarter fiscal 2016 scheduled earnings release, that will be for the 12-weeks ending February 14, will be after the market closes on Wednesday, March 2, with earnings the following morning on Thursday, March 3.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Brandy and be happy to open it up for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom","First question, a lot of moving parts with some of the one-time items, I know you guys don\u2019t give guidance anymore, but I\u2019d be curious how the quarter overall performed relative to the expectations that you would have budgeted back in August?","Richard Galanti","We beat them.","Charles Grom","You beat them? Okay. Second question, when you look at new member sign-ups, how has the trend been by age group? I\u2019m curious your ability to attract younger customers given the success of Prime and other programs out there. Have you guys started to look at the signups by age group, et cetera?","Richard Galanti","We have and I don\u2019t have the most current month\u2019s detail, but from a month ago budget meeting, we\u2019re getting \u2013 first of all, the average age of a Costco member has come down. I think a few years ago, we were about four years older than the average in the US, now we\u2019re a little under two years older. About a third of our new signups in recent months have been millennials and albeit I\u2019ll make it a point and provide a little more color on that each quarterly earnings release.","Charles Grom","The last question for me just on the gross margin, it\u2019s the first time in a long time that all four categories have been positive. Just curious if you could provide a little color maybe by category what\u2019s driving that?","Richard Galanti","I think the one that\u2019s historically in the last many quarters, that\u2019s always the one that\u2019s a little volatile and volatile is mostly defined as down year over year is fresh foods. And that has to do with the fact that commodity prices have increased, we maintained prices. No doubt, things like rotisserie chickens and the like. And I think there\u2019s been a little bit of deflation in some of those categories and some meat, but also our volumes are particularly strong.","When you got a low double digit comp in produce as an example, that\u2019s going to help you, because its sales are strong, availability of products is good and spoilage is less. So those are the types of things that help you in fresh foods. I think the strength in electronics has probably helped us. Those are the things that come to mind. I don\u2019t have \u2013 organics is helping.","Organics, as I mentioned before, it\u2019s kind of a win-win for us. We get for us a fuller margin, a more fair margin within the confines of what we limit ourselves to and it in our view creates even a greater competitive mode given that\u2019s where sometimes retailers will try to make [war] [ph].","Charles Grom","And your organic penetration stands at what at the current time?","Richard Galanti","Organic, $4 billion plus, it\u2019s still growing very strongly, but I don\u2019t have the detail in front of me. Sorry.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. Thank you.","Richard Galanti","One other point on the soft lines, our apparel has been pretty strong too in terms of apparel basics. And so that\u2019s generally a full margin business.","Operator","And your next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel","Richard, a question on the fresh food deflation and I guess maybe it behaves a little bit differently by category. But if you think about meat and dairy in particular, is that less of a benefit to you margin-wise and more of a volume benefit just because you pass the declining prices through more quickly than most of your competitors by design and so it\u2019s probably more of a help to volume than margin or no?","Richard Galanti","Yes, it\u2019s more of a help to volume. If anything, we\u2019ll bring price down and we\u2019ll always err to the low side. So if we have a calculated margin that\u2019s making the numbers up, but $8.15 a pound is going to be $7.99, so you have all those things working towards that.","John Heinbockel","The price elasticity on that is pretty high?","Richard Galanti","Price on strip steaks or items like that, yes. When you could hit another dollar a pound, if you will, lower or a few dollars a pound on some items that drive business. And needless to say you\u2019ve been in Costco and talk about massing out big good-looking stuff, that\u2019s fresh foods is where we shine.","John Heinbockel","You said e-commerce growth was down a little bit. Is that purely mix?","Richard Galanti","There\u2019s been no comment, nothing that was called out specifically why that is and that\u2019s so I\u2019d assume it\u2019s mix.","John Heinbockel","And lastly, the leverage that you\u2019ve gotten in core operations was better than we\u2019ve seen in a couple of quarters. It\u2019s pretty broad-based. Is there anything you\u2019re doing differently whether it\u2019s managing labor, benefit design that would have \u2013 because comp wasn\u2019t that different versus prior quarters. So is it something you\u2019re doing internally to manage those items?","Richard Galanti","I wish we knew more here, but I mean, everything we do every day and I\u2019m not trying to be cute here, but certainly we continue to focus on things like basics like overtime hours, every four weeks when we have an all-hands budget meeting here, each of the 16 or so senior VPs or country managers of operations get up and talk about things that they\u2019ve done in their region to be more efficient.","And I think that pays off. We have focus items that they talk about each month; they talk about other things, working with buyers to create more seamless movement. All those things we really spend a lot of time on. One of the things that I think benefited us are assumptions for healthcare cost, notably US where it\u2019s most expensive and it\u2019s most inflationary, we\u2019ve done a little better job of that.","It was little over a year ago that we made a few changes in the plan in terms of primary caregivers primarily within the plan, and that changed a little behavior, not that big of an impact to the employee, but a better management of that. So I think we\u2019re still getting a little benefit of that there. But it\u2019s in the core payroll as well and I think that\u2019s a combination of lots of little things like I mentioned.","Operator","Your next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Curious if you can help diagnose the consumer, I know we saw some volatility in your monthly comps and there\u2019s been some unevenness in other parts of retail. You gave us some good color in November, but what do you think is going on? Does spending appear back to normal? I don\u2019t know if it was just a temporary hiccup?","Richard Galanti","I remember, it\u2019s October when we said one month does not make a trend. And then the first couple of weeks of November weren\u2019t terribly exciting and then it got more exciting. And middle of November and late November, it was quite a bit stronger than the first part of November.","So again, I think we weren\u2019t really concerned when it was \u2013 when frequency was a three instead of a four, but overall comps continue to be well, our markdowns are in good shape, even though inventories a little higher, and so I think we still feel cautiously optimistic and certainly confident about what we\u2019re doing right now.","I think if you\u2019d ask me what surprised me in the last month versus the last couple of months, electronic has finally turned and that\u2019s I think a function of people coming in, pricing keeps coming down. I think our fresh foods has been great. The fact that many times I\u2019m explaining the fresh foods year over year margins are down a little, they were up a little. That\u2019s all good. So I think that reflects well on us. I can\u2019t speak to the consumer outside of that though.","Simeon Gutman","So other than electronics, the complexion of what consumers are spending on looks back to normal, back to the old cadence?","Richard Galanti","Yes, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything for tomorrow. But what\u2019s nice when I look at the November results which I have in front of me, underlying in the US which is the big piece here, so it does take \u2013 relates the FX issue. Soft lines was low double digits, fresh notwithstanding some deflation and the average sale in meat was good. Yes, and so I hope it will continue, stay tuned.","Simeon Gutman","And just a follow-up gross margin because I guess the printed number is the highest number since our model goes back to 2003. And you mentioned the four core categories were good and I think you attributed somewhat to mix. But big picture, the mix of product, that will probably keep benefiting you. Can you give us a sense on the leverage with suppliers? How much of that side of the coin is helping you as well?","Richard Galanti","I haven\u2019t heard anybody talking about major changes in leverage. We are \u2013 I think if you ask our suppliers generally, we are typically front and center with them. When freight rates have come down as you might expect some suppliers are reluctant to \u2013 they are waiting for us to call them back to offer that. Global sourcing I think is helping us competitively a little bit. So overall I think we\u2019re still tough.","I mean, there have been some suggestions out there that some retailers going back to manufacturers to insist on extra moneys. When we read that and hear that, we hear it from as you might expect and we have to understand that there\u2019s some people out there that sell all of this and we share things each way. You\u2019re going to find \u2013 we\u2019re going to go back and make sure we get our share of that. So I think we continue to be tough; I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been any change in that.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS.","Michael Lasser","Can you describe what you\u2019re doing to prepare for the transition to VISA? And as you make that transition, how are you going to inform your existing members and new potential members of the switch?","Richard Galanti","I\u2019m glad a lot of that\u2019s in the operations and membership marketing areas. There\u2019s a lot going on, needless to say, between our company and the new issuer Citi that\u2019s going to be coming out. Citi and American Express are currently discussing what they need to be doing in terms of that transition.","And again, contractually there\u2019s not a lot we can say at this point, but rest assured it\u2019s going to take several weeks to transition, but the assumption is that the existing members with the existing cobranded card will be getting new cards in the mail on or about the time of the actual transition. And it will be hopefully as seamless as possible to them. Once we\u2019re allowed to communicate to our members about the new program, which again contractually we can\u2019t do that until that time, as you would expect like anything we do, we\u2019re going to let everybody know and put it in big letters.","Michael Lasser","Should we factor into our models a potential disruption from the transition? Will there be a period of when you take both VISA and American Express for a period of time?","Richard Galanti","There may be, again that\u2019s still influx. There are some possibilities of that. But whether there\u2019s an exact transition, a binary transition or an overlap period of time, I don\u2019t really see a lot of disruption on that side. As you might expect, it\u2019s a royal pain to do this, but it\u2019s what we do. You\u2019ve got teams of people in operations that are working with our people in membership marketing and they are working with the new outside provider to make it as seamless as possible to have the communication out there both in store, via email, via letter. And so I think it\u2019s going to go a lot better than one might think. It\u2019s just a lot of work to be done.","Michael Lasser","Coming back to the topic of traffic, three out of the last four months traffic has been a little slower than the 4% you had been seeing consistently before that period. Are you just running into a point where there\u2019s now either limitations on how frequently some of your members, some of your most loyal members can shop or limitations on the throughput that some of the stores are having based on the level of traffic that you\u2019re already seeing in those locations?","Richard Galanti","I think in terms of the level of throughout, we keep doing a better job of that. We keep \u2013 in my view, in my own calculations, we keep raising the number of amount of annual volume a warehouse can do. Certainly, there will be somebody in line saying God, why did I come on Saturday afternoon, but at the end of the day that\u2019s not an issue.","Look, I remember in calendar 2009, for calendar 2009, the first year after the bad economy hit, we had a frequency number of around 4. And I was reminding people that if calendar 2010 was zero, that compounded number of plus 2 for those two years would have been better than our average over the prior 20 years.","And now we\u2019ve enjoyed seven years, calendar 2009 through calendar 2015 that have been slightly above 4 on average on a compounded basis. So at some point, it has to come down a little bit. We feel very good about where it is. We can\u2019t look at any specific factor to say this is why it used to be a 4, in the last couple of months it\u2019s been a 3.5. We feel very good about where it is.","Operator","Your next question is from Robbie Holmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert Holmes","Richard, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about partnering with Instacart and Google and maybe how that\u2019s going versus your expectations. And also, can you remind us how the membership is impacted by that if it were to roll out nationally? How does membership fee get accounted for in that? And then I have a follow-up question.","Richard Galanti","Sure. Well, each one is a little different. I believe with Google, you have to be a Costco member to go through the Google Shopping Express network. So it doesn\u2019t impact membership at all, perhaps it gets a few members because there are some people that aren\u2019t going to come in, but now they can get some things delivered to them.","With respect to Instacart, I believe it\u2019s the Instacart memberships and of course they buy multiple memberships. Net-net, it might be a slight decline [Technical Difficulty] all trying to grow their businesses. So I think starting from the point that many out there were concerned, everything is going to go this way and what\u2019s going to happen to all this brick-and-mortar.","In our case, we see some changes. The net increase in some of these is that there is a slight improvement in total comp, recognizing you\u2019ve got a few more visits that are delivered. But it\u2019s still a very small thing. And so there\u2019s not a lot of knowledge I can give you beyond that.","Robert Holmes","Just the other question was on with the success in fresh food and organic and everything, are you seeing space allocation grow to that area? And if so, where is it mostly been coming from and is there a maximum [Technical Difficulty].","Richard Galanti","[Technical Difficulty] refrigerator and frozen, putting in more vertical stand-up coolers versus the coffin coolers in the deli and cheese areas. So we\u2019re getting more out of our space. We\u2019ve added space. My guess is that there\u2019s less incremental space that we can do, but we\u2019re still doing it to some extent.","And the other thing is that\u2019s an area where we can benefit by turning it faster as well. So a lot of our expansion was to enable us to turn it fast, not only more square footage or more lineal footage outdoors that are more vertical cases, but have more merchandise out there, better presented and easier to grab. And I think we\u2019ve done a great job in that area.","Robert Holmes","Lastly, the CapEx I think you\u2019re saying is going to be up like $0.5 billion or so versus last year. Can you remind us what that extra $0.5 billion compared to last year is for?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Roughly eight or 10 more locations, roughly a few more extensive locations internationally. There is all that other stuff I talked about where we\u2019re adding \u2013 still adding a few gas stations, still adding a few hearing aid centers. Depots, our infrastructure which is we think a big competitive and profitable advantage to us.","84%, 85% of our goods now go through our cross-dock operations where the average life of the majority of that inventory is less than a half a dozen hours. So we\u2019ve got a lot there. I believe IT is \u2013 I don\u2019t have it here. I think that will be \u2013 year over year it\u2019s going to be $60 million to $80 million. I don\u2019t have it in front of me. I\u2019m sorry. But that\u2019s a piece of it as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Horvers with JP Morgan.","Christopher Horvers","So Richard, I understand your comments on the MFI growth and the underlying trend being very strong. But as you look at the MFI ex FX, it seemed to have slowed off a strong four quarter trend that you saw through the third quarter of last year. So how much of this is social media offers? Are we lapping some big international openings as well? Basically trying to understand what the right underlying trend in MFI growth is.","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t see a big concern there. Some of this is social media. And I know anecdotally one thing we did was living social thing a year ago which was very good. We\u2019ve not done that again at the corresponding time this year. I\u2019ve not seen any comments from our membership marketing people when we reviewed the quarter with them of any concerns. There maybe a little timing with openings, international openings, but again we don\u2019t see any big trend there that concerns us in terms of trend change.","Christopher Horvers","No trend change? Okay, understood. And then can you help us think about the gas? I know you get this question a lot, but you had some nice gas benefits last year. In the next quarter, you\u2019re going to lap I think what was an even stronger quarter, the second quarter a year ago. So maybe anything on how much gas was a net benefit or a net detriment on a year to year basis, quantitative hopefully, but any qualitative comments just to help as we think about this upcoming quarter?","Richard Galanti","We\u2019ll tell each quarter, but in Q1, again, one would have thought, one includes you guys and me, that gas profitability would have fallen down a little bit, still very good, historic relative to our history, but versus very strong numbers of Q1 a year ago. We had pretty good numbers this time.","I think year over year it was within $0.01 of profitability, flat to down less than $0.01 year over year. I think we also had a very strong Q2 profitability that may be tough to match, but we\u2019re early in the quarter. And Q1 surprised me, I can only be surprised there, but if it does come in a little bit, we\u2019ll certainly share with you if it\u2019s more than a penny or two delta.","Christopher Horvers","So a tougher compare but you were surprised to the upside on this case and taking that all into account maybe it\u2019s not as bad as people fear out there?","Richard Galanti","Right. Again when I say surprise to the upside, we are still down year over year a shade, but again last year was pretty strong and Q2 was even stronger. We\u2019ll see how this quarter goes. In fact, if gas prices and oil prices drip down a little bit, that generally bodes well for us. But again, I\u2019m not suggesting it can be as low as last year, we\u2019ll see.","Christopher Horvers","And just one last question on the traffic side, I know you said you don\u2019t really see a change in the box in the consumer. Does the fact that November was largely driven in the back half of the month concern you at all or is that just an indication of the consumer continuing to wait for the deals that come around Black Friday?","Richard Galanti","If I knew I\u2019d be doing something else, we actually looked at it as a positive. We were starting to get a little concerned is it\u2019s slowing down a little bit. I think the fact that we don\u2019t put as much emphasis on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, it still did well. But we\u2019ve got a lot of people coming in earlier that week for crazy numbers of pumpkin pies and the like, all those things can help us. The fact that electronics was strong was a surprise to us. So I don\u2019t think we look at it that way at all.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","I apologize for any background noise. I am in the airport. But I wanted to just go back first to your color that you provided on margins just to make sure that I captured some of the details that you listed out. When it comes to gross margins to start, I believe you spoke to the actual core of four categories up once again 13 basis points, similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter. You noted that ex the cycling of the one-time benefit from last year, gross margins would have been up an additional 7 basis points.","And regarding the inventory levels, you stated that you feel pretty comfortable with those levels just given how strong the first week of the second quarter was. Is that a fair representation of your color on gross margins and how should we think about that going forward?","Richard Galanti","Yes, but mind you the 7 basis point is a one-time item. The 13 is the core business, it\u2019s not like this 13 becomes 20.","Paul Trussell","Correct, on the core, absolutely.","Richard Galanti","Yes, we feel pretty good about that.","Paul Trussell","And then regarding just SG&A again, just for my clarification, making sure my table is clear. Stock compensation, you mentioned was up meaningfully year-over-year, $36 million I believe you said. So about a $0.05 hit or so on a go-forward basis. That will only be about a third of the hit in the next few quarters?","Richard Galanti","What I\u2019m trying to convey is that because of timing, our annual grant to everybody is in late October, because more and more of the recipients, particularly the recipients like myself who has been here 32 years, almost, so you\u2019ve got accelerated vesting. So the entire hit is now not spread over 5 years. So really that\u2019s a timing issue; that\u2019s going to help you a little in the future.","But the fact of the matter is because it\u2019s October, we\u2019ve got a big hit in October or Q1, so just taking in the math of what we \u2013 if you think about it, the actual hit to P&L this year is a function of those grants that have been made over the last five years and then [indiscernible] adjusted when it vests faster than that accelerated based on tenure.","So not only do you have more people on the plan today than you had \u2013 as a piece from five years ago gets fully extinguished and you\u2019re adding a new piece, A, this new piece has many more people from five years ago; it has a stock price per share a lot higher; and you\u2019ve got the vesting.","The vesting in my view being one of the key ones. And so the way it hits, just simple math is that $36 million year over year change is more than half of our expected year over year increase in that line item. So if it was half, in each of the next three quarters, it\u2019d be about a third of 50% in each of those quarters. It\u2019s not quite there, but instead of being $36 million, it\u2019s going to be in the $10 million to $13 million range or $8 million to $13 million range each period.","Paul Trussell","And then the legal hit, is that fully contained into this particular quarter? And then also on the IT modernization, how should we think about the cadence of those expenses going forward relative to what we saw in 1Q?","Richard Galanti","In terms of the $22 million, again, it\u2019s a couple of items that we\u2019re still in the process of. That\u2019s our best guess of the impact. We don\u2019t think there is going to be any big surprises there. If anything, you try to be reasonable and conservative.","Outside of that, in terms of IT modernization, it\u2019s a little bit of a broken record here, but there is light at the end of this tunnel incrementally, and I\u2019m hopeful that sometime next year we will see that flatten out and come down. But we got a lot going on there. And again, it\u2019s part of our operations. It will come down as a percent of sales at some point in the future or come down certainly relative to the type of increases we\u2019ve seen. But it\u2019s necessary and we\u2019re starting to see some deliverables finally.","Paul Trussell","Last for me is just on the international side. Canada and international segment have been able to have a reasonable spread versus the US in margins. I believe some of that\u2019s due to a little bit maybe less competition, maybe a little bit less labor costs. As you continue to grow the business and expand into new markets, how do you think about the margins in those segments going forward? Can it maintain a little bit of a reasonable spread versus the US?","Richard Galanti","I think all things being equal Canada is going to continue to be more profitable than the US and some of these other countries are going to continue to be even more profitable than that, not all, but some of them. We have no illusion that some of the ones that are really outsized profitable come down a little overtime, but Canada is mature, still growing a little in terms of new units, still growing nicely in terms of local currency comps and it\u2019s nice that we\u2019re the only club in town.","That being said, we\u2019re still are own toughest competitor. We have a little extra margin there, not a lot. We have a lot lower healthcare cost as a percent of sales. So there is other things that help us up there, not just little extra gross margin.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.","Brian Nagel","The question I have, Richard, you called out electronics as a point of strength. Could you comment specifically on the TV category? And to what extent some of the new innovations in TVs are helping drive better electronic sales? And a follow-on to that is as the holiday season has gotten underway, what type of price promotions you\u2019ve seen throughout the sector on TVs?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t have the quarter in front of me, but for the four weeks of November reporting which would be through the Sunday after Thanksgiving, those four weeks ended then, within majors which was up again ex FX in the mid teens for the month, I think I said it was in the low double digits for the quarter. TVs for the month were up both in dollars and sales in the mid 20s. So it\u2019s quite strong. That maybe because last year was a little weak.","I don\u2019t know; I don\u2019t have that in front of me. But it certainly was strong. I think there is a little bit more promotions; cell phones are strong; tablets are strong \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, tablets have come down a little bit, but phones are strong and those are the big things. Video games are strong, again all those other strongs or little weakers are dwarfed by television sales within electronics.","I think the technology, the 4K is helping, but the prices are coming down as well. I was there across the street yesterday and you\u2019ve got smaller flat screens with great quality less than $200. You got bigger TVs less than $1,000. You got as well the giant HD 4K whatever under $3,000 and under $2,000, depending on the size and some of the new technology. So I think all those things are helping us a little bit on that category.","I pointed out also because it\u2019s one of those we continue to get asked about as .com continues to take market share in electronics and the impacts to other brick and mortars over the last few years. I think Best Buy has been a little better on TVs as well, but certainly this has been a standout for us of late.","Brian Nagel","And one follow-up question. I know you addressed this in your prepared comments too, but the inventory growth in the quarter, so if you look at it on a year-on-year sequential basis, it did tick higher here in fiscal Q1. What explains that?","Richard Galanti","The two biggest components of that $900,000 ex FX number year over year is electronics which is about $25,000 and that\u2019s planned [in new and find] as expressed in these sales numbers. And apparel and again we are out there in mass and these are basics, I mean, we\u2019re not going to be left over with lot of red and green Christmas dresses, because that\u2019s not what we sell. I mean, we\u2019re doing fine.","We feel we have no concerns about our inventories, our markdowns, something I know we\u2019ve learned years ago the cheapest markdown is the first markdown and the quicker you get rid of stuffs that that had problems and our markdowns overall have been nothing to be concerned about.","Operator","And your next question is from Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","My first question just want to get a little more clarity around this transitional period as you have to cease signups for the card, you talked about it in terms of EPS impact on the quarter that you just reported and some residual impact over the next couple quarters. As we think about where this shows up in the P&L, is there any discernible impact on the top line? And if you could kind of dimensionalize the impact on the member fees as well just to understand where we would model for that to happen?","Richard Galanti","We don\u2019t have any new cobrand cards being signed up right now. So that\u2019s impactful a little bit to the membership line, not a lot. 99% of \u2013 that\u2019s going to go to sales. Everybody who has a cobrand card currently is still using it. So there is no impact there. Again, what I tried to do recognizing that $1.09 reported figure was going to raise some questions, we just looked at what are the things that we can really look at. Given that our sales continue to be strong, we\u2019re not really looking at that line to see how much sales do we estimate we\u2019re losing.","I assume we\u2019re losing, in theory, you\u2019re losing a sale for somebody that signed up as a member that can\u2019t sign up for the cobrand card. They are still buying from us, they don\u2019t have the cobrand card, they don\u2019t have that reward. They\u2019re probably using some other Amex reward card, recognizing at its current strength, Amex is about 40% of our sales.","There are still 60% of people that aren\u2019t using Amex, whether they\u2019re using debit or a very old house card from \u2013 we don\u2019t own it, some years ago or another Amex card. So we don\u2019t see a big impact there. Is it greater than zero, the negative impact, of course, but again given where our sales numbers have been, this is something that there is specific pieces that moneys earned for new signups in the equation and so we pointed that out.","Matthew Fassler","Second question, you talked about the seasonality of stock comp expense and the bulge you saw this quarter. Just to confirm what you talked about we saw this past Q1 and what you talked about for the rest of the year. It seems to be seasonally a lot like what you had last year even though it\u2019s a bit different from what you had over the prior few years. Is that an accurate way to think about it?","Richard Galanti","Yes. By the way, comp is \u2013 it is part of our comp and it is part of SG&A. We have always pride ourselves for many years we never changed the number of shares. So as the stock compounded at 19% a year, that piece of 3,000 or 4,000 people\u2019s compensation improved dramatically. As you may recall a couple of years ago we reduced the number per recipient at whatever level that was by I think 15% and again we just did it again in the grant that just happened, notwithstanding you\u2019re still seeing this big increase because of just how that works.","Matthew Fassler","And just another quick follow-up on the demographic piece. You gave us a couple of interesting numbers. A couple different ways to come at that question I guess, is the average age of a new member changing for you? Has that been moving in one direction? You talked about it relative to the national average and presumably that couldn\u2019t happen without the average age coming down. But without knowing what the national average has done at our fingertips, kind of hard to know.","And then also, members in multifamily dwellings versus single family, if you think about millennials staying in that kind of environment and multifamily in general gaining share from single family. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re able to look at it that way. Any sense of how you\u2019re faring with that cohort?","Richard Galanti","I haven\u2019t seen anything that\u2019s presented to me that way. I\u2019ve said a couple of times in the last many months when people talk about millennials, I think the good news is we\u2019re getting more of them and things like organic certainly help, social media helps a little bit, but millennials is going to be an issue for the total pie in general if people move home after college for a period of time, if they move into a smaller place, if they get married later and if they have fewer kids.","It\u2019s going to rain on all of us, so we\u2019re certainly having increasing the share we get on those people who will help, but we\u2019re going to keep driving value. And given the flexibility of the types of things we can continue to sell, we\u2019ll see where it goes. But we have not looked at that. If we start looking at that, I\u2019d be scared.","Operator","Your next question is from Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.","Steven Zaccone","This is Steven Zaccone on for Oliver Chen. Thanks for taking our questions. Just two quick questions. As you look to the remainder of 2016, are there any areas of the assortment that you have an opportunity for improvement in your view? And then secondly, we just had a quick question regarding the E. coli situation. Have you seen any traffic disruption from the headlines? It does appear that you have the situation contained but just curious have you seen any traffic disruptions?","Richard Galanti","On the latter, no. That was contained pretty quickly and the information was communicated pretty quickly. And I believe that the last possible episode related to Costco of someone being fallen ill was November 1, so we\u2019re trying to pass that. Thankfully nobody was extremely hurt. There were a couple, there\u2019s a few that did go to hospital and I understand that they\u2019re all doing better now. So nothing new as it relates to that.","And in terms of the other question in terms of what\u2019s new, again it\u2019s more of the same. I can\u2019t give you anything specific at the top of mind. Organics continues. At KS, we\u2019re doing a few more things, but that\u2019s steady as we go.","Operator","Your next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets.","Kelly Bania","Just wanted to ask another question on the transition to Citi. As we get closer to that transition in the spring, just curious how you feel about it? Sounds like there is a lot of preparations involved. And maybe you can just remind us what\u2019s different about this in the US versus what you did in Canada a couple years ago? And maybe what you learned in that transition process?","Richard Galanti","Well, it just takes time. I think the big difference is in Canada the new issuer was not able \u2013 did not purchase the portfolio from American Express and therefore it\u2019s what referred to as a de novo program where our customers, members have to sign up and reapply for credit. And so that\u2019s a little more disruptive. Now, it\u2019s a MasterCard up there and so there are many people out there that have a MasterCard in his or her wallet already. So it\u2019s not something they use.","And then in terms of auto renewals, part of our renewal rate is the fact that you have some members that do auto renewal, which as you might expect statistically has a slightly higher renewal rate because it\u2019s auto. And the assumption here in the US is that the portfolio will be \u2013 the transition will include the purchase of the portfolio and I think the language which we\u2019ve used in the past is that that\u2019s what we anticipate because there is always a chance that something can happen, but we\u2019re working towards that end as you would expect the issuers out there.","So again, recognizing that Canada is 10% of our company and the US is 70%, so these are bigger numbers. I would guess that if you look at the $15 million I pointed out as it related to just revenues we get for signing up new cobrand cards, even if the same percentages occurred up there, it wouldn\u2019t either be worth calling out in terms of the company as a whole. So it\u2019s just going to take some time. I\u2019m just trying to share with you what I can at this point. Nothing big is going to happen, we\u2019ll get through it, and we\u2019re very excited about the next many years under a great program.","Kelly Bania","Any color you can provide on what percent of members do use the auto renewal and anything else we should think about just modeling?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t have that at my fingertips, but I probably would \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t share that. As many as possible would be the answer. It makes it easier for the customer and certainly it gives them a reason to more likely renew. ","Kelly Bania","And then, just another question. You mentioned I think two new business centers planned for this year. I was just curious if you could talk about how those are working? Any relative profitability versus a typical club and just what you think about that format going forward?","Richard Galanti","First and foremost, we\u2019re opening regular warehouse clubs. For a number of years, we had anywhere from I think six to eight business centers that were doing okay, slightly profitable, but not setting the world on fire. There were a lot of changes that was made to it a couple of years ago and they are growing nicely. They are more profitable than they had been.","And it\u2019s another avenue, it\u2019s going to be a lot smaller footprint in terms of how many units we have than a regular warehouse, regular Costco warehouses, but we\u2019re doing this just like we\u2019ve done everything pretty methodically. On a base of 10 or so, we\u2019re going to open a couple. And so it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve discovered something that we\u2019re going to go from 10 to 20 overnight in one year.","So yes, it\u2019s good and it\u2019s a positive business for us and it certainly is a focus on the business member. We also from time to time identify items in the business center that makes sense to sell in all of our locations. So we think it\u2019s a positive. Some of the examples also is where we\u2019ve taken an old Costco which is smaller footprint, perhaps not as well located for our general population member, as we\u2019re relocating an old unit, we will convert that other one in that city into a business center. So that\u2019s been helpful to us as well.","We did that in South Atlanta; we did that in Chicago I think in Bedford Park. I believe the New Jersey location is a relocation where Hackensack went to Teterboro. So I mentioned that we opened a new one in Teterboro that\u2019s a re-lo of Hackensack which is now over that several month period is being converted into a business center. So we think it\u2019s good. When asked what\u2019s driving our earnings growth and what\u2019s driving our whatever, I\u2019ve always said it\u2019s a lot of little things and this would be one of them.","Operator","Your next question is from Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler","I have one quick question. Can you just remind me of the timing of the new credit card?","Richard Galanti","Our current relationship expires March 31 and there is a window of few months there post that this could extend. So it will be sometime between April and December is my best guess at this point.","Meredith Adler","And then you guys are still working very hard on your technology modernization. Can you talk about whether you\u2019ve been pleased with the timing of everything and whether all the new systems have been rolled out smoothly? Technology is notoriously late, but how is it going for you guys?","Richard Galanti","Smoothly would be an overstatement. I mean, I think in the beginning of time when we talked about this starting about three or four years ago, we said this is our best guess and I have jokingly said whatever you think it\u2019s going to do it\u2019s going to take twice as long and cost twice as much. Anybody that\u2019s gone through it, I think generally experiences that. We are experiencing some level of that as well.","That being said, we\u2019ve got everybody\u2019s supportive of it. The deliverables that we have had, sometimes they\u2019ve taken longer, they\u2019ve cost more. We\u2019ve learned from what we didn\u2019t know. As we find out, we do a better job on the next thing. And so again overall I think it\u2019s costing a little more than we thought, it\u2019s taking a little longer, but we\u2019re getting some deliverables.","Over the last year, like the new membership system, a new point-of-sale system, a big roll out of really the foundation of our accounting system will be at the beginning of the new fiscal year. So we got a lot going on, but we\u2019re getting through it. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t quote about it because we know it\u2019s tough and it takes long time, but we\u2019re getting there.","Operator","Your next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky","Richard, can you give us a little bit of color or some range on how many stores might be opened this year? You said 32 on the top end. How low could that be and where would you expect some of the shortfalls to be?","Richard Galanti","32 is my best guess. If I had to guess what\u2019s the low end, 27 or 28, that just simply means \u2013 under 27 example, that means five in the latter half of the year in the original budget that\u2019s skewed out a little bit. Right now, I\u2019m looking, we\u2019ve got seven new units coming in Q3 in this plan and 15 in Q4 with about half of those, probably eight of those in August. So I\u2019m sure a few of those is going to slip.","Okay, some of those have slipped out because this number was 35. So I\u2019m guessing 28 to 32, again it\u2019s a fluid number. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve lost any, but I know a couple of them we\u2019ve already delayed, might be a year delay for zoning issues. One example there, again we found some things underground that original core testing didn\u2019t find. So you\u2019re always going to find some things out there like that.","Chuck Cerankosky","Can you talk a little bit about a competitive behavior that you\u2019re seeing out there whether it\u2019s a reaction of a more conventional stores to what you\u2019ve been doing? There\u2019s not many retailers out their showing the comps that Costco is. Are you seeing any reaction in your channel and outside your channel and especially as you enter some new countries?","Richard Galanti","Overall, no. I mean, we are \u2013 and I\u2019ve said this many times, we are our own toughest competitor and I mean that, in our industry, notably Sams and to little extent BJs, but certainly many locations where we compete head to head. We\u2019re in their locations literally every week and I would assume they are in our locations every week. And we feel good about the competitive posture there. I think it helps our average volumes are dramatically higher and that allows you to do a lot of things and I think the nature of our member. So I don\u2019t think we see any big changes there other than where we keep doing pretty good.","As it relates to traditional competitors, regionally we look at all kinds of things. In the Northeast, we look at companies like Wegmans, which is a great supermarket retailer that are opening more units. That\u2019s in our view our customer, high end customer particularly in the quality of fresh foods, although our fresh foods numbers are pretty good. So I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.","We\u2019re helped by the fact that we can choose to do things like women\u2019s athletic wear, active wear where we could literally create $100 million of sales on full margin items that didn\u2019t exist a few years ago. And I think our global sourcing initiatives and things that gives us we believe an edge on things like produce, but you can\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t do the kind of volumes we do.","So I think we\u2019ve got some good advantages out there and we are, I think, one of the best and not resting on our laurels. So in terms of .com, again, we\u2019re pretty methodical about it. Some of the things we\u2019re doing are helping, albeit from a [Technical Difficulty] lot of ways and I think we\u2019re getting better at that too.","Operator","Your next question is from Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","I just wanted Richard to get your thoughts here and maybe have the numbers even, what the penetration rate for e-commerce and services like rental cars and travel services and that type, insurance services, what the penetration rate is among your members? And if you have, has it been growing?","Richard Galanti","They\u2019re growing nicely. We do not give out that information. They\u2019re all pretty good businesses. They\u2019ve all grown slowly overtime. Travel is doing very well. Things like car rentals, I can tell you I visited some shareholders recently on some proxy issues and during that I was just giving an example though of our rental car business which has grown dramatically in the last year to well over 2 million rentals a year and a lot of that is online.","And in two different meetings, individuals who prided themselves on knowing how to get the best deal on car rentals went online during the meeting and were able to save of the same car from the same [Technical Difficulty] try it and we got to do a better job of communicating that. So those businesses are growing. They are all generally small percentages of the total, so I think that creates more opportunity for us.","I think I read recently where if we were a car dealer, we\u2019d be the second largest car dealer in the country based on the number of new cars purchased by our members through the Costco auto program. All those are additional reasons to be a member. They\u2019re all very profitable and growing. And if they\u2019re very profitable, it means we\u2019re going to keep getting even better values. So it\u2019s all good.","Scott Mushkin","And your e-commerce penetration rate, do you have that or is that something you don\u2019t want to talk about either?","Richard Galanti","E-commerce, in terms of \u2013 what do you mean by penetration?","Scott Mushkin","What percentage of the members are using your e-commerce offer?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t have that in front of me. It\u2019s probably not as much as it should be and it\u2019ll keep growing. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute, I just don\u2019t have that number in front of me.","Scott Mushkin","And when we\u2019re looking at these things and we\u2019re looking at frequency, I would guess that these are outside your frequency, they don\u2019t get counted, is that true?","Richard Galanti","Correct. Our frequency is front end transactions at the warehouse. So it doesn\u2019t include gas, pharmacy, optical. If you shopped at front end, no matter where else you shop, it\u2019s just one transaction. So if you shop just at the gas station, it\u2019s not a transaction in terms of our shopping frequency.","Scott Mushkin","And the e-commerce is not ringing up as transactions either? Frequency? It\u2019s transactions but not frequency.","Richard Galanti","E-commerce is like a warehouse, so that is adding up. That is 3% of our business. So even if it\u2019s growing at 3 times at 20-plus percent versus 7%, it\u2019s de minimis to that number. Why don\u2019t we take two more questions?","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Drbul.","Robert Drbul","I just had two quick questions. On the credit card, the $0.02 hit this quarter, is that expected to be something similar over the next few quarters in terms of the impact? I guess the question is when you start to get to the new relationship, will there be additional marketing expense that you would also incur in addition to what is impacting the business today?","Richard Galanti","In terms of the first piece of that question, yes, I don\u2019t know if it round to $0.01 or $0.03, but call it $0.02 is the guess. And it\u2019s a guess. At the time of transition, their money is baked into the deal, so I don\u2019t see any big impact to that hitting our numbers.","Robert Drbul","And you mentioned the Alibaba Singles Day. Can you just give us any insight in how you\u2019re looking at China and essentially what you\u2019re learning so far from that relationship?","Richard Galanti","We\u2019ve been asked about China for 20 years in about every two or three years, it used to Jeff and Jim and our head of international, Jim Murphy, and now of course it\u2019s Craig and Jeff and our international Jim Murphy and a few others in real estate. And we keep looking. At some point, we\u2019ll probably open a couple of units. But we haven\u2019t pulled that trigger yet to actually go forth.","I would say it\u2019s probable in the next five years, but we got a lot going on. And for 20 years, we\u2019ve never been terribly concerned about we got to get there now. So this gets our name down a little bit, but it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve strategically sat down and said, hey, let\u2019s get our name down for a few years and then go. The Alibaba team all thing happened because they came to us and we did depreciate how many Kirkland Signature items were selling on their site before we sold them directly and at a better value.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Daniel Binder","You mentioned earlier in the call there was some of these one-time items that we were aware of, some that we were not. Just in terms of things like legal and regulatory, is there anything that we should anticipate in Q2 based on what you know today that we should be factoring in?","Richard Galanti","No.","Daniel Binder","You mentioned a little contribution from international which contributed to the tax rate difference. I was just curious, is that related to start up costs in areas like Spain, just higher losses associated with that or is it something...","Richard Galanti","Not at all. What I was talking about is if you have $100 in Canada earned and year over year in the quarter the Canadian dollar relative to US dollar is down 15%, we bring it down at $85 of income, not $100 of income. And Canada being marginal tax rate, federal tax rate I believe is 26% currently versus actually off a little bit versus 39% in the US.","In some other countries, it\u2019s actually a little lower or higher, but generally speaking, I believe the US versus in the nine countries you are, our affected US tax rate \u2013 our earnings in the US is quite a bit higher than anywhere else. So it\u2019s the penetration of foreign earnings to total earnings, it\u2019s that simple.","Daniel Binder","So we had an opportunity to visit your Getafe club in Spain. It was pretty impressive. I think one of the areas that was surprising was the amount of local sourcing you\u2019re doing especially in areas like fresh and we heard about some of the export activities with local vendors. I was just curious if you could expand a little bit on what that opportunity looks like when you \u2013 not just for Spain, but other countries you\u2019re operating in. How much you\u2019re doing in terms of cross-border type sourcing for other clubs and whether it\u2019s the US or Japan, et cetera, it seemed like it was growing.","Richard Galanti","First and foremost, the big thing is multinational vendors getting the \u2013 a lot of times, even with multinational vendors you\u2019ve got two or three or four geographic world regions. And I remember when we went into Australia and now we have eight units instead of one or two or three a few years ago, still with only eight, there is divisions of multinationals that aren\u2019t prepared quite to sell us, make available certain things and certainly sell us at global pricing. That can only change when they get us involved and again since we have that meeting here every four weeks, the budget meeting, that\u2019s when that happens. So I think a focus on that has helped us.","As it relates to going into these markets, to the extent there are items in those countries that helps us both ways and I think that\u2019s, if you will, I think we do a good job of that. Those are all small little things that help long term. I\u2019ll give you an example back in Japan a few years ago, I forget the name of the \u2013 there\u2019s a very well known what\u2019s considered a very premium tea that\u2019s a Japanese branded product, that they initially were reluctant to sell us when we entered Japan, even as we had ten or so units.","Once we worked with them to provide a cobranded Kirkland Signature by that brand name, not only in Japan but it sells very well in Eastern Canada and long the West Coast and California, all those things are net positives and not only afforded us an ability to have a premium item with a decent margin and a new item in these other markets where we\u2019re strong, that market potential allowed us I think to procure items faster in some of those countries. So it\u2019s a win-win. But these are small, again that is a small example.","Richard Galanti","Thank you very much. We\u2019re around today if you have any further questions. Have a good day."],"5971":["Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) Q3 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call May 29, 2014 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Richard Galanti - Chief Financial Officer","Analysts","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Jason DeRise - UBS","Peter Benedict - Robert W.

My name is Bridget, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Quarter Three Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.","Richard Galanti","Thank you, Bridget. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our third quarter operating results for the 12-week period ended May 11th.","The discussions we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and\/or performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements.","The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in today's call, as well as other risks identified from time-to-time in the company's public statements and reports filed with the SEC.","To begin with, our 12-week third quarter results, operating results, for the quarter reported earnings per share came in at $1.07 a share, compared to last year's third quarter earnings per share of $1.04.","As I go through the line item detail on the income statement, I will point out a few factors that impacted earnings both up a little and down a little. One item that I will point out upfront, of course, is the FX impact to the entire income statement.","The FX impact of weaker foreign exchange rates year-over-year when reporting profits from our international operations, that represented a little over $17 million pre-tax or between $0.025 or $0.03 a share impact to the P&L to the negative.","As an example, year-over-year in the third quarter the Canadian exchange rate, the Canada dollar relative to the U.S. dollar was down about 8%, Japan yen down about 6% year-over-year. Offsetting a little bit from strengthening foreign currencies for the U.K. and Korea and a couple of others but dwarfed of course by Canada.","In terms of sales in the quarter, total sales were up 7% and our 12-week reported comparable sales figure was up 4%. For the quarter sales were negatively impacted by gas price deflation which is about 25 basis point impact and by weaker foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year which in the aggregate impacted sales by about 140 basis points to the negative.","Excluding gas, the reported 5% U.S. comp sales increased in Q3 would have been 6% and reported plus 3% international comp figure, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 8%, such that the total company comp, which we reported a plus 4% for the quarter, excluding gas and FX would have been plus 6% for the whole company.","In terms of new openings, after opening 60 new locations in the first half of fiscal 2014 and the closing of our Acapulco location earlier this fiscal year due to the hurricane damage. We opened four new locations in Q3, two in the U.S., one in Louisiana and one in Texas and one each in Japan and Korea.","All told that puts our 2014 fiscal year openings through the third quarter end at 20, since third quarter end on May 15th we opened our first Costco in Spain in Seville and this week we are opening our sixth location in Australia in Brisbane, our 11th Korea location and our 20th Costco in Japan, so three openings outside of the U.S. this week.","By weekend, we will be operating 657 locations worldwide and after that and through the end of the fiscal 2014 on August 31st we expect to open six more locations, four in the U.S. and one each Canada and U.K. Such that we will most likely end the fiscal year with 30 new openings less the one closing in Acapulco or 663 Costco\u2019s worldwide as of August 31st.","This morning, I will review with you our e-commerce activity, our membership trends and renewal rates, recent common stock repurchase activities and of course, discussion about the various line items of the income statement.","So on to the results, as I mentioned, total, actually, total sales in the quarter came in at $25.2 billion, up 7% from last year\u2019s $23.5 billion. On a reported comp basis, Q3 comps, again, were 4% for the quarter on a reported basis, 6% excluding gas and FX.","Now looking the 4% reported comp sales figure, it was a combination of an average transaction increased of 0.2% up, of course, that was on a reported basis, excluding gas and FX, the average transaction was up just under 2% and an average frequency increase of up 4.3%, which by the way is the same number year-to-date through the third quarter.","In terms of sales comparisons by geography, within the U.S., Southeast and Midwest were the strongest in the high single digits. Internationally in local currencies, Australia was the weakest due to cannibalization on a relatively small base of existing units with Korea, Taiwan, Mexico and Canada all coming in in local currency in the plus 8% to plus 10% range.","In terms of merchandise categories, sales results for the quarter, for the third quarter within the food and sundries, overall in the mid single digits. Frozen food, candy and meat, deli were relative standouts. Hardlines, which overall was just above flat, about a 0.5% up, departments with the strongest results were office and automotive, consumer electronics sales were down in the low to mid singles.","Within the mid to high single-digit softline comps, small electrics, domestics and apparel were standouts. In fresh foods, comp sales were up 8% with produce and meat being strongest, although, inflation on the meat side.","Moving down the income statement, membership fees came in at $561 million, up 6% or about $30 million year-over-year and down 3 basis points as a percent of sales. Again, FX that $30 billion increase would have been $38 million-ish assuming flat year-over-year currency exchange rates.","In terms of membership, we continue to enjoy strong renewal rates, continue to tick up a little bit, U.S., Canada for the, as of, for the quarter was up, the renewal rate through the quarter end was 90.6%, so first time averaging, rounding upward and 87.3% worldwide. Again, we see continued increase penetration of the executive membership and I will speak about that in a minute.","Overall, new member signups in Q3 were up about 1%, a lot of that, sometimes it\u2019s up a little, sometimes it\u2019s down a little, really has impacted by, particularly by some of the Asia opening schedules where we get outsized new member signups.","In terms of numbers at year end, at year end and I am sorry, Q3 end, at the end of the third quarter Gold Star members totaled 30.6 million, up from 30.1 million 12 weeks earlier. Primary business 6.8, up from 6.7 million 12 weeks ago and business add-on was steady at 3.5 million.","So all told, member households 40.9 million at Q3 end, up from 40.3 million at the end of second quarter. And including the add-on cards, the extra card, total cards outstanding 74.6 million at Q3 end, up from 73.4 million 12 weeks earlier.","At May 11th, Q3 end, paid executive member were shy of 14.4 million, representing an increase during the quarter of little over 300,000 new executive members or about 26,000 per week increase in the quarter. Executive members continue to be about a little over third of our member base, little over two-thirds of our sales.","As I mentioned earlier, our renewal rates have continued to tick up, business members at Q3 end were 94.4% from 94.3% renewal rate 12 weeks earlier. Gold Star 89.7% from 89.6%, so all told 90.6% versus 90.4%, and worldwide, I mentioned, the 87.3% number that was up from 86.8% 12 weeks earlier at the end of Q2.","Continuing down the income statement to gross margin, gross margin year-over-year in the third quarter came in at 10.62% of sales, down 5 basis points from last year\u2019s 10.67%.","If we jack down the following little metrics then I will explain it, I\u2019ll walk through it. There will be four columns and six line items. The line items would be core merchandizing, second line item would be ancillary businesses, third line item would be 2% reward, fourth line item LIFO, fifth line item would be other and then the total would be, the sixth line item total.","The four column would be reported in Q2 \u201914, the second line, this column would be without gas deflation in Q2 \u201914 and then columns three and four would be for Q3 \u201914 both columns and again, reported and without gas deflation.","So, again, going across those four line -- those four columns, core merchandizing, it was minus, it was plus 1 basis point in Q2 \u201914 on a reported basis year-over-year, without gas was minus 1.","For Q3 it was plus 9 and plus 7, ancillary businesses were, again reading across the four columns zero, zero, plus 1 and zero, 2% reward, minus 1 and minus 1, and then for Q3 \u201914 both reported and without would be zero and zero. LIFO minus 6 and minus 6, and for the Q3 \u201914 minus 8 and minus 8, other zero and zero, and Q3 \u201914 would be minus 7 and minus 7, so all told was minus 6 basis points year-over-year in Q2 \u201914 on a reported basis point -- on a reported basis. In Q2 \u201914 without gas deflation was minus 8 basis points total and then in Q3 \u201914 reported and without would be minus 5 and minus 8 basis points, respectively.","So as you can see the overall reported gross margin was lower year-over-year by 5 basis points, minus 8 without gas deflation. However, our core merchandize gross margin was up year-over-year both with and without gas deflation of 9 and 7 basis points, respectively.","For the third quarter on the merchandize categories on sales, food and sundries gross margin were about 20 basis points and -- were up in the 20 basis point range year-over-year, while hardlines and softlines were in the high single-digit basis point increase range year-over-year.","Fresh foods gross margins were just slightly lower year-over-year less than 5 basis points delta, which is actually an improved, relative improvement from recent quarterly performance in that area.","LIFO in the third quarter we recorded a $12 million or 5 basis point minus pre-tax charge in the quarter that compared last year in Q3 of an $8 million or plus 3 basis point pre-tax credit due to deflation a year ago. So year-over-year is a $20 million swing or about $0.03 a share.","In terms of inflation, LIFO, if I look at just the, as one represented a factor in that, data point in that, if I looked at our U.S. inventories looking at the LIFO calculations, Q2 end versus Q3 end and in the 12 weeks there was about quarter of percentage point delta in the LIFO index. With foods, not food and sundries but canned goods and alike was up little over 1% during those 12 weeks.","Lastly, other, last year in the quarter gross margin benefited from a non-recurring legal settlement received last year in Q3. This accounted for about a 7 basis point minus swing year-over-year both with and without gas. There is a little over $17 million pre-tax benefit last year in Q3, again related to this legal settlement which is about right around $0.025 a share.","Moving down to SG&A, our SG&A percentages were higher by 4 basis points year-over-year coming in at 9.86% of sales this year, compared to 9.82% a year ago. As we did with -- as I did with our gross margin, I\u2019ll ask you to do the four columns, first two columns are Q2 \u201914 and Q2 \u201914, both reported and without gas deflation, and then Q3 \u201914 and Q3 \u201914 reported and without gas deflation.","The five line items would be operations, then central, then RSUs or stock compensation, then quarterly adjustments and then total. Again, going across operations, the first number would be minus 12 basis points, meaning that in Q2 \u201814 year-over-year core represented a 12 basis point increase year-over-year in SG&A, then minus 9 and then in Q3 \u201814 those two columns would be plus 3 and a plus 5 or the core operations was improved by 3 and 5 basis points, respectively.","Central going across the four columns, zero and zero, and then minus 2 and minus 2, meaning a little higher year-over-year, RSUs minus 1 and minus 1, and then in Q3 minus 5 and minus 4, there were no quarterly adjustment, so in that fourth line item would be zeros across. And then the final column, the total, final row the total, minus 13 and minus 10 and in Q3 \u201814 reported SG&A again was higher year-over-year by 4 so, minus 4 there without gas minus 1.","In terms of a little editorial on these numbers, the operations component of SG&A again was up 3 basis points better year-over-year in Q3 and 5 better excluding gas deflation. Within warehouse operations, our payroll percentage of sales was lower year-over-year by or improvement by about 5 basis points. Total payroll dollars increased a little over 5% in Q3 compared to that 7% total sales increase.","Benefits of workers comp hit SG&A by about 3 basis points year-over-year, so that was a little bit of an offset to that improve. Our central expense it was higher year-over-year by -- in Q3 by 2 basis points, which is actually the same number as related to the ongoing IT modernization -- incremental modernization cost that was about 2 basis point hits the quarter. There are a couple of other things that went both ways for those of that, that would be the one thing, I would point out there.","Next on the income statement is pre-opening expense, pre-opening expense was up $6 million from $10 million last year in Q3 to $16 million this year. We actually had one -- one more opening last year, five last year versus four this year, although, that timing of that relates to both things after the quarter as well.","I might also point out, of course, with the opening of Spain, you always have a significant pre-opening expense related to the opening of the country itself in that first warehouse that was about $4 million of that $16 million number for Q3 this year.","All told operating income in Q3 \u201814 came in at $734 million, higher by $15 million from last year\u2019s $722 million. Below operating income, interest expense came in at $25 million both this years and last years fiscal third quarter.","Over 95% of it relates to the interest expense related to the 10-year maturing $1.1 billion debt we have that matures in 2017 and the $3.5 billion of debt that matures over the next two to six years that we did back in December of \u201812.","Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $3 million, so coming in at $15 million last year relative to this year or this quarter $12 million positive. Actual interest income for the quarter was higher by $2 million.","The other component of interest income and other amounted to $1 million positive this year versus $6 million positive last year, so minus $5 swing. Majority of these negative earnings relates to the negative impact of mark-to-market adjustments on forward FX contracts used to source U.S. goods and certain foreign operations.","Swings are caused by changes in dollar, U.S. dollar relative to local currencies -- local currency in certain foreign location as compared to the prior years and this, we just pointed out as part of that impact sometimes it\u2019s little positive and sometimes it\u2019s little negative.","Overall, pre-tax income was higher year-over-year by $12 million in third quarter coming in last year at $712 million and this year up $12 million to $724 million.","In terms of income taxes, our tax rate this quarter came in a little better or lower at 33.9% versus 34.8% last year. This was primarily due to the higher year-over-year penetration of profits coming from our foreign operations which overall have lower tax rates than in the U.S.","Overall, reported net income of $459 million last year at $173 million of net income this year in third quarter.","For a quick rundown of other topics, again the balance sheet is included in this morning\u2019s press release, but I\u2019ll point out a couple of balance sheet info items. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was $237 million and so year-to-date $708 million.","AP as a percent of inventories came down 2 to 3 percentage points, on a reported basis it showed last year 102% accounts payable as a percent of inventories, this year 99%. If you look at just merchandize -- merchandize payable not other types of payables like construction payables, last year in Q3 that 102% was 91% and this year 91% comes -- went from 99% is an 89%, so still down a couple of percentage points year-over-year.","Average inventory per warehouse was up about 7%, on a per warehouse basis coming in at $13.0 million this year up from $12.2 million last year. The increase was pretty much spread over many departments, apparel was probably the biggest delta, the men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019s apparel was up year-over-year of about little under $200,000 and foods and candy was up about $150,000. Overall, though, we feel our inventory is in good shape and not a whole lot to talk about there.","In terms of CapEx, in the first quarter we spent $574 million, in the second quarter this year we spent $447 million and in the third quarter just ended we spent $405 million, so Q3 year-to-date we are just a little over $1.4 billion. Our estimate for the year for CapEx is will come in at about $2.2 billion compared to last year\u2019s expenditures for the whole year of $2.1 billion, so up slightly from last year.","In terms of Costco Online, we continue to operate Costco Online in the four countries that I\u2019ve mentioned in prior quarter, U.S., Canada, U.K. and Mexico, U.K and Mexico of course being much newer than the U.S and Canada operations.","For Q3 sales and profits are up, sales were up 15% year-over-year in the quarter, a little impact from the weak Canadian dollar, but overall 15% on a reported basis.","I\u2019ve talked about the various things we have done in the last year and year and half in terms of re-platforming and adding mobile apps and combining some of the e-commerce merchandising buying efforts with some of our line efforts. We have added a few categories like apparel, some limited apparel items and some limited health and beauty items. We\u2019ve started to ship out of more than one depot to improve timing of shipments, some of the bigger ticket items as well.","Outside of e-commerce, there's a couple of things that in the internet area or things that we\u2019re testing. I mentioned before the Google test, Google Shopping Express in the Bay Area more recently in last several weeks. It's been tested in Los Angeles with some retailers not just us but in Los Angeles at our Culver City location and in Manhattan at our Manhattan location. And those are -- both those two cities are just in the last four to six weeks. Also we\u2019ve tested a few from a membership signups standpoint, a couple of social media area -- social media initiatives with LivingSocial and Zulily.","Next on the discussion list, in terms of expansion. Again through Q3 end, we've opened 20 units then have the current closing of the Acapulco location earlier this year because of the hurricane. Q4 in total including the few that we have already opened, we\u2019d expect to open 10. So again 30 openings less the Acapulco location between nine net increase for the year.","So looking back over last year and half, fiscal \u201813 for entire year, we had 26 units on a base of 608. So about 4.5% square footage growth this year, assuming the 30 net new units to be 4.5% to 5% square footage growth. Again 30 openings this year, 17 would be in the U.S., three in Canada, one in the U.K., two in Korea and two in Japan, three in Australia and one each in Mexico and Spain. As of Q3 end, total square footage stood at 93.7 million square feet.","Next item, stock repurchases. As mentioned on the call, I guess about 12 weeks ago that we would -- that we anticipated we would begin buying back some stock. We began our recent repurchasing activities on March 7th. I think that was the day after our second quarter earnings results were released.","For those nine weeks since then through the end of the third quarter, we purchased 1.6 -- little over 1.6 million shares at an average price of $113.14. Total dollars expended during those nine weeks of $183.6 million. In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend per share increased with a May dividend payment from $0.31 a share on a quarterly basis to $0.355, so about 14.5% increase. This $1.42 per share annualized dividend represents the total cost of the company of about $625 million a year. Lastly, our fourth quarter scheduled earnings release will be Thursday, October 9th. That will be for the 16-week fiscal fourth quarter ending on August 31st.","With that, I\u2019ll open it up for Q&A and turn it back to Bridget. Bridget?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Hey, Richard. Good morning. How are you?","Richard Galanti","Good.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Just on the core, up 7 and then the fresh foods came down slightly year-over-year. Just wondering if you could remind us how that fresh food margin has trended over the past couple of quarters. And given the inflation that we\u2019re seeing today, what kind of your expectations so that over the next -- I guess, over the next 16 weeks?","Richard Galanti","Yeah, well, I can\u2019t give you a whole lot of information about the expectations. I can tell you a little bit about what\u2019s happened the quarter and year-to-date. Year-to-date those components, fresh food is year-to-date. Do I have that here? The total consolidated, fresh food year-to-date was down about 22 basis points. And that includes up the -- down the 4, 5 or sub 5 this quarter. So for the first half of the year, it would have been more than that minus 22.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. So what\u2019s the change. Like what\u2019s changed us part of that? Is it a little bit of relief on the pricing front or is it something different?","Richard Galanti","I think one thing that I one pointed out last is certainly I mentioned historically that we have kept the rotisserie chicken on the same price for the last two years when cost dramatically increased. We\u2019ve seen some relief there in the last quarter and so a little over that probably, that\u2019s one item and that\u2019s a huge item.","In terms of that -- this factor but beyond that, I mean it\u2019s a conscious effort to -- we want competitors but we are also trying to show a little margin improvement. So that\u2019s the only thing I could point out. In general, as it relates to inflations, we tend to be little laggard when there is some inflationary pressure.","My guess is, is that when I looked at the core components, so that the food and sundry is up. That\u2019s where there is more inflation. There is also some LIFO charge related to that. Overall, when prices are going up quickly, I also believe we have to raise them, when they were probably going to be slower than others. So again, that\u2019s on a general basis. Overall, beyond that I know here is a whole lot to talk about in terms of trend there.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. I know there are price discloses in the queue but if you could just shed a little bit of light on operating margin performance internationally. And then also in the U.S., how they are compared to last year?","Richard Galanti","I think we\u2019re still cross checking those numbers and want to -- that will be out of the Q. Generally speaking, the trends that you\u2019ve seen continue, I mean, FX doesn\u2019t play into those numbers from the standpoint of percentages because FX hits every line item on a Canadian P&L as an example. Canada continues to be more profitable that as a percent of sales than the U.S. and other international overall tends to be in that direction, skews a little bit on a smaller base of total units when they are open in Spain or we cannibalize some units in the country. But overall, I think that it\u2019s fair to say that your columns two and three with column one being in U.S. are more profitable as a percent of sales than the U.S.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Okay. And then last question, in April, you called out state of California is improving, the entire state. Just wondering if you could elaborate on that improvement. Do you think it\u2019s sustainable. And I guess, what do you think was driving it?","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s sustainable so far. I don\u2019t know about the future. When I called out just geographically some of the members I think, California, again the ones that were -- I called out were Southeast and Midwest. California actually was a little better than the Northeast and the Northwest, pretty close to the total for the company. So overall, I think California continues to do a little better than given its maturity and size. I can\u2019t tell you why though.","Charles Grom - Sterne, Agee","Good. Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Richard, just a quick follow-up on the inflation question. A number of companies have said in the last four to six weeks they have seen a sea change in some items, it's all perishable. Have you seen anything like that or what you are seeing is more gradual?","Richard Galanti","Well, when I look at, just again the various LIFO pools for U.S. inventories which is one indication -- LIFO pools of course are cost pools but the -- back-like items year-over-year. And again you start the New Year at a cost of 100.00 for everything. If I look at the -- well, I will call the foods pool. This is not fresh foods that have canned goods, cereal, all types of food items I got. That\u2019s up a little over 2.5% from the beginning of the fiscal year.","In the last quarter, in the last 12 weeks of these 36 weeks, it\u2019s about 1.2%, so almost half of that delta. So yes, that\u2019s into the fee change. I haven\u2019t looked at that closely in fairness. When I look across items in terms of inflationary items, again just shooting down the list, looking at top 25, most impactful items to our LIFO calculation. There is several nuts in there, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, all the high teens to low 30s.","There are seafood items. There is -- generally speaking those are types of items. There is few produce items, that tends to be item based not produce based, based on where a drought or freeze or rain was. On the deflationary side, it\u2019s the usual suspects, the bunch of electronics. That\u2019s a lot of the items, couple of small apparel items.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then again, I guess, beef in total would be a bigger -- is that a bigger sales item in total than your chicken products?","Richard Galanti","Sure. Beef overall, I think in the last -- beef prices are up 10 plus percent over the last quarter on a year-over-year basis. So yes, clearly, there is more inflation in that. I think on the poultry side, there has been some inflation. But we were successful in locking in some stuff as well.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Another topic on payrolls, you said up 5% dollars. What has the trendline been on that? And it actually seems like a pretty good performance for you. Are you doing anything different process-wise in the clubs to try to tweak that a little bit?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. I don\u2019t have in front of me. I think the last few quarters when I pointed out payroll. That\u2019s generally been a slight benefit basis point wise, which would indicate the dollars increase a shade less than sales -- total sales increase. I think first and foremost it\u2019s sales. I mean driving a tough line is our biggest benefit.","Beyond that, there continues to be a focus of things like overtime hours, lots of little things like that. I don\u2019t know if there is any giant process changes in the warehouse of late that I can think off.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Is that the total number, if you look to payroll and comp clubs would be up less than that, right?","Richard Galanti","What was that?","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","5% is a total number. If you looked at it on a comparable basis, it would be less than that. So when you think about, at least on a waiver . What comp do you need to get leverage, you can get leverage on a lesser comp than you\u2019ve been getting, fair?","Richard Galanti","Yes, probably little higher than some other retailers but little lower than it has been historically for us. We also probably get a little benefit from increasing penetration overseas where as a percent of sales, it is a low labor percent.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","Okay. And then just one last thing. Monthly coupon book performance, just curious; you have been doing a much better job in the clubs signing in the club what items are in that coupon book. Has that done anything to performance of the items in the book or no, not really?","Richard Galanti","Well, I like to find out how you concluded that. First that, I think -- look they keep working it. It\u2019s a challenge. We\u2019ve done it for a lot of years. I think we\u2019ve first of all done better that timing is such that they are easier to manage both by the buyers and having it essentially, usually like a week in between them to give the warehouse time to move out what remnants are left than the old MDM and being able to bring in new stuff. Again overall, every time you do an MDM, you have more experience about some thing that maybe has petered out a little bit because we have been running it every year, every six months and the things that did surprisingly well, perhaps on a regional basis that we want to push everywhere. So as you might expect, we work with our vendors on that, figuring out how to best spend that money to both, also we drive sales.","John Heinbockel - Guggenheim Securities","My comment was just that on the shelf itself. I'm seeing more. This item is in our coupon book this month, which I hadn't seen going back a few months.","Richard Galanti","Okay. Fair enough. And that you are right on that. Thank you. I agree.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Hi. Good morning. I just had a few questions, please. First, on inventory, you\u2019ve seen inventory tracking decent amount of sales in the last four quarter or so. The clubs look clean, at least the ones I visit. I\u2019m just curious what the driver is, is it the new clubs, is it dot-com, maybe a little bit color on that? And then also, I know you had an amazing turnout for job applications in Spain, curious what the early days are looking like in that club. And then finally on the IT spending, I imagine you probably have a pretty good idea of what that looks like for Q4, so should we expect a similar sort of 2 basis point incremental impact there?","Richard Galanti","Okay. On inventories and a question related to where the increase is coming from, I think fairly we have -- yes, we do have more inventory in e-commerce because we are now shipping out of more than one location. But that\u2019s relatively small to the total, when I look at the total average per location. Again, the big areas were the conscious effort on our part in apparel and one of -- I think our success is that we talked about last several quarters is massing out and making bigger commitments to some items that have done, we call high fashion basics, but everything from true basics to seasonal items like shorts and bathing suits and kiosk items. We\u2019ve done really well in some of those items. So we\u2019ve certainly committed more inventory in that area. By the way, that area tends to be usually in the middle center area where we\u2019ve shown some areas like media over the last few years. As it relates to -- what was the next question was?","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Just early days in Spain.","Richard Galanti","Well, Spain, so far so good. We only were there for two weeks. We\u2019ve had good sign-ups, not like Japan and Korea but very, very good in our mind and we are pleased with the result so far in terms of sales and is growing. We have small baskets when people come in for the first time but we were pleased with the results. I really don\u2019t want to be, chew it either way. It\u2019s so far so good.","And the last question related to IT. If you had asked me before, I\u2019d have said minus two. A couple weeks of ago, I would have said it\u2019s probably minus three just because it tends to be in that three to four range on average. It's probably in the minus two to minus three range next quarter but we will have to wait and see. Starting near the end of the quarter and into Q1 of \u201915, there will be a couple of other projects that go online and because you depreciate -- you capitalize those and then amortize them over, typically a five-year period, sometimes little less and sometimes a little more or up to seven and generally no less than three.","But usually I\u2019d say five is a single point average. My guess is it will tweak up a little bit again. And as I\u2019ve said, our best guesstimate over a three or so year period in terms of incremental impact to SG&A would be 10 plus basis points. And we look down, I think this is about the seventh fiscal quarter, we talked about it. And so I had an average, if you look at all of fiscal \u201913, those four numbers and annualized the three quarterly numbers this year, we are probably in the 6 or 7 basis point or 5 to 7 basis point range incremental then we\u2019d probably have another three or four to go after that. So this is guess and a decent estimate but we will wait to see.","Dan Binder - Jefferies","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.","Meredith Adler - Barclays","Actually my questions have been asked already. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot and good morning. Two questions. The first, Richard, relates to online. If you could give us a sense as to what your members are asking for more obviously. It sounds like you are evolving the mix, are there areas where you would expect to grow the assortments incrementally based on member demand?","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, I think the areas that we\u2019ve grown over the last year relative to prior to that have been some limited apparel items. There is some health and beauty aid items and perhaps another replenishable office items, K-Cups, health and beauty aids, some small office needs. As you are probably aware, from the first many years, many of our items were big ticket and in many cases deliverable and in some cases white-glove installed items like big screen TVs and patio furniture and swing sets and the like and certainly some of those in furniture. Some of those are still our biggest categories for, one, they have been on for longer and two, they are bigger ticket items.","In our own way, we are looking to see how we can get items on there that are more regular and frequent to get people return to costco.com and I think we are doing better, a little better with signage even in the warehouse with that certain items. Somebody doesn\u2019t want to necessarily have to shuffle it home and install it. They want to -- they are willing to pay for that delivery and certainly, our prices are very attractive even on that basis.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","It is just really a follow-up on that. As you think about the vintage of member that\u2019s doing business online, is there a difference between those that have been Costco members for many years and maybe those who are newer to the company?","Richard Galanti","Well, generally speaking, newer to the company means less and less purchases. Certainly, when we get a new sign-up online because they are buying online, I would say generally, they tend to be low. I don't have exact numbers there. When we've done -- when we look at the age breakdown of our members based on how long they have been numbers or throughout the United States. And we look at new member signups through a couple of these social media things that we've done in recent months, what you would expect it to be. You\u2019ve got a younger member signing up through LivingSocial and Zulily so. And it\u2019s a relatively attractive cost of acquisition. So we are not going crazy here. We are taking baby steps but some of this stuff works.","Matthew Fassler - Goldman Sachs","That's very helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Hi. It\u2019s Jason DeRise here. I wanted to ask a question on the margin decision on some of the food items that you sort of have a fixed price. I guess I just want to understand the rationale for not changing those and the comparison I want to make whether it's fair or not is that your fuel prices are not fixed price and it varies with what\u2019s happening in the markets, so why not with rotisserie chicken and hot dogs and things like that?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Well, that\u2019s right behind the black curtain here. Look, at the end of the day -- first of all, I want to make another point of the previous question. As it relates to -- well, I will stop with that. Let\u2019s get to your question first. In terms of fixed items, I mean, in retail, there are price points that are hot, I mean, the $1.50 hotdog and soda. I think we didn\u2019t sit down when they had said, let\u2019s decide that the rotisserie chicken should be at but its price has changed dramatically and we saw the competition raising the price. It was a hot price. Let\u2019s take a little less margin, take a little less margin, that little or no margin. And so I think there are few examples of that extreme. Gas historically has always been an item that there are some locations where we comp shop the price three or four times a day compared to the locations nearest us. So, I mean it intends -- I think it\u2019s just the nature of retail and the nature of what we do. We don\u2019t sit down and kind of optimize everything. We are merchants. There are key price points and that\u2019s how we do it.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay.","Richard Galanti","Gas, by the way is a lot more volatile, a lot more volatile and a $12 billion or $13 billion business for us. But it's very visual out there. I mean, people -- you go to some of these apps like Gasbuddy.com. There is a reason that we are comp shopping that item in some locations three, four times a day.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay. No, I know it's an unfair comparison but I thought -- I don't know, just help try to understand the thought process between things like that. I guess as the follow-up on the last question, maybe it will get you continue to follow up on the answer to the last question. But as you do these -- as you try out social media or the LivingSocial type promotions to get younger members to sign up, how do you manage with the limited number of SKUs to keep both your core boomer shopper happy and then also have enough relevant items for a millennial shopper, or do you think that doesn't matter?","Richard Galanti","Well, we\u2019ll have to wait and see. We are not going to keep our head in the sand on it but extreme value works. And again to follow-up on the previous question, what I was going to mention was the test that we are doing will roll now in three major markets into Bay area, L.A. and New York City. Arguably those -- if you look at the age breakdown of those, it\u2019s younger. That\u2019s a positive.","Now, I don\u2019t think we are ever going to get your one box of Life Cereal and one box of Fruity Pebbles and two different types of half gallons of milk deliver to your doorstep at six in the morning. But there is a lot of things that we have. I mean, we\u2019ve certainly changed, frankly expanded the items out of the locations in the Bay area and you will continue to see that. So we are excited to see what the Instacarts and the boxes are doing as customer of ours. But they are small, they are new and there is going to be lot of things.","So, I think there is still a lot of reasons -- not everybody wants to just sit home and type in stuff to have it delivered in the morning, people like to go out and do stuff. We are pretty good at getting you in the warehousing. We will have to evolve over time as well. But there is certain things in our model. There is a reasonable way to sort of markup goods on average 11%, on average 11%, on arguably buying power that\u2019s at the top of the heap in terms of strength and not always good. But we are open-minded but don\u2019t expect us to deliver to everybody\u2019s doorstep. If others want to, we will be happy to accommodate and help them do that with our stuff.","I mentioned this last time and jokes aside, organic is getting bigger, not just for us but for everybody. But again just like we wow people in our produced numbers, numbers in our produced department, we have great quality on slightly oversized items for families. That whole organic thing is arguably. And again, I don\u2019t think we sat down and strategically thought about it. We look at what items work well and price of things and when it works, we really go after it. We\u2019ve seen surprisingly good success on organic and produce and fresh meat, fresh ground beef. And the challenge is the supply, frankly. There is not enough supply but if we can show great value, we will figure it out.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Okay. And actually that was what I was going to finish up on as an example of something for a younger consumer base in the demographic. So you think that when you put these items on the shelf like organic compared to conventionals, you are getting enough rate of sale that all the economics from your point of view work or if it's not quite that level, you are willing to stick with it?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, the level of economics are still on an item basis. As we said, there is less supply. We just don\u2019t put it in normal locations and we love to have twice as much in some locations. But items live and die around here since the beginning of time -- since 30 years ago and certainly some of these organics are really starting to take off. I think so far one of the benefits that we think we had, I think I mentioned this before, not only in some cases, I think I\u2019ve used like the fresh ground beef example of organic. It\u2019s a higher price point. We get a slightly better or full margin -- by our definition full margin, because it\u2019s not football everyday out there in every supermarket chain. And to our pleasant surprise, 75%, 80% of these sales in this new item was truly incremental. It was existing members that didn\u2019t buy ground beef at Costco because they did buy organic and so it was incremental. And so these are all small examples, but they are going to grow over time.","Jason DeRise - UBS","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert W. Baird.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Hey, Richard, a couple questions. First, can you talk about the level of new member sign-ups that you guys tend to see when you open up a club internationally versus what you see in the U.S.? I mean, how dramatic is that difference?","Richard Galanti","Well, I don\u2019t have exact numbers in front of us, but we are in a well-penetrated, very successful market, like LA or parts of Virginia, New York. You might have and what we look at is during the eight to 12 weeks prior to opening when you\u2019ve got the parking lot partially done and there are some tabling activities outside where people kind of sign-up. You might have as few as 3,000 or 4,000 new sign-ups through those eight or 12 weeks. In a new small market, like somewhere in the Southeast like Louisiana, Baton Rouge or New Orleans, or Knoxville couple of years ago, you might have 8,000 to 12,000 because even though it\u2019s a much smaller market, it\u2019s new. We\u2019ve had some extreme examples during those first many weeks prior to opening day of 30,000 to 40,000 members in some of the Asia countries. It\u2019s somewhere in between there, Spain and Australia, so better than the U.S., but you know again the benefit is when you open it up in LA, Huntington Beach a few years ago or something like that, you may have fewer new signups where you are getting a lot, you get existing members in your shop more frequently because they got a unit 10 or 15 minutes from their home instead of 30 minutes.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Okay, that's helpful. And then there was no gross margin headwind from the Executive reward, 2% reward this quarter, what's happening in the spending patterns between your Executive members and your regular Gold Star members? Are the Gold Star members kind of picking up incrementally? And just remind us where you have the Executive membership being offered, what countries you don't have it, and where you don't have it what are your plans for getting it there? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well, theoretically, our plan is to put it wherever we can and make sense. I don\u2019t know if I know off the top of my head where else it\u2019s going. Currently we have US, Canada, UK, and Mexico, and I know we are looking at couple of countries, but I am not sure let\u2019s say when I guess in the next year or two we will have at least one more country. Part of it of course based on size, number of warehouses and number of members in that country, and you would want to get a handful of offerings going to be able to go with a handful of offerings to start with.","I don\u2019t think the delta one is as we open, there is probably a little more sales penetration in some of those new markets. There is international markets where we don\u2019t have it, that probably impacted a little bit. I am not terribly concerned. It\u2019s generally been in the 1 or 2 basis point delta year-over-year in terms of how that reward impacted. This time it was zero. I don\u2019t know off the top of my head. I haven\u2019t heard anything or sees anything at the monthly budget meetings about any concern about that. If anything, we are continuing -- my one surprise yesterday or a couple of days ago looking at these numbers was the fact that we probably -- the 25,000 or 26,000 new Executive members, new and converted Executive members per week during the quarter is a little higher, certainly a lot higher than Q2, I think a little higher on average than the last several quarters on average. So we still get lot of people to convert and that\u2019s good.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Yes. Now that certainly looks like that trend continues to be healthy. So it looks like the Gold Stars are definitely doing better. Last question, just early thinking on your openings for 2015. If there is not a number, maybe just kind of a geographic split, how you are thinking kind of international versus the US? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","I think it would be similar to this year, 30, maybe a little -- hopefully a little 30 plus you know. I think I mentioned this year, if we get to the 30 from the 17 in the US, it\u2019s a little more than half, I would guess half, is it 45% to 52% or something next year, not 55%, but overall we still think we\u2019ve got opportunity in the U.S. and in Canada and every market that are extremely well penetrated. And we definitely have the pipeline more fill overseas now. If I have to guess, it would be a number north of 30 and south of 34.","Peter Benedict - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thanks very much.","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Thanks, Richard. Thanks for taking my question. It's actually more of a big picture question kind of going back to some of the e-commerce discussions and just noting that one of your biggest competitor's CEO is on record yesterday saying that, if consumers just don't want stores, maybe we won't have stores, when talking about kind of the trajectory here in the US in e-commerce and whatnot. Now maybe that\u2019s because his stores aren't performing as well as yours. So I guess one of the things I'm wondering is you could say that Costco doesn't have as well developed of an e-commerce platform. You could also say that a lot of stuff you guys carry Amazon has been pretty aggressive in, yet your stores are doing great. Why do you think that is, what is the number one reason you think you are overcoming maybe demographics, e-commerce, and really just putting up some of the best sales in retail?","Richard Galanti","Well, I think you mentioned some of the mix, it\u2019s merchandising, it\u2019s quality, it\u2019s quantity relative to price, it\u2019s extreme value. Arguably our demographics is -- I don\u2019t think you need to be an economist to understand that our demographic has probably been impacted less than the lower demographic retailers. Clearly gas brings you to the parking lot. Our fresh foods is a signature category and fresh foods is something, if jokes aside, if you like our rotisserie replacement or our whole meal replacement items or any of those great fresh food items or organic produce, that\u2019s the reason for you to come in. If you walk by the sweaters and the batteries and the patio furniture and the activewear, you are going to buy some more stuff.","So we think that again delivering small quantities of stuff to home is not free. Ultimately somebody has got to pay for it. And if we are going to lose sales over time some of that, we will figure out how to not lose as much and how to drive sales in other ways. I mean I think we have been pretty good at that. But starting with average markup of average gross margin of 11%, which is nobody comes close to that, I think we will be pretty good, but we are also open. I mean, we are not trying to put any fluff in it. We like the fact that it\u2019s being exciting to work with Google to look with opportunities to drive business that might go somewhere else. Some of these other new companies that are doing things and using us as part of their platform to pick up and deliver the numbers at a small cost, that\u2019s great. So we will keep figuring that out, hopefully there is also some items that we only have and start -- usually that starts with the name Kirkland Signature or some crazy items that we only have that somebody bragged about that, they can get at Costco, whether it\u2019s some incredible price on branded handbag or bicycle or kayak or whatever. So there is all kinds of reasons to come at Costco.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","That's a terrific answer. When you think about your own e-commerce business, how do you prevent it from basically cannibalizing the heck out of your own stores? We've used it before, but we've been using most of your e-commerce for like furniture, stuff I would never get at your warehouse. I mean, how do you guys think about it as you grow this business and how it doesn't just cannibalize yourself and take your ROICs down?","Richard Galanti","Well, I get back to the question is if somebody is going to take that business, we would rather take it. We also recognized that, I\u2019ll call the good old days when you only had one -- there was no such thing as the Internet, you only had one choice if you wanted to get that TV or that patio furniture at that price, you either find a friend with a pickup truck or go get a U-Haul and get it home. You had choices now and so we do believe that we are selling some of those items that would not have been involved in store, not everybody is going to take those items home that way. So we have to change with the times there, but we also recognized we also have to get you in on increasingly hopefully increasingly frequent basis. So you pass by all those items that you go wild, and I think so far we\u2019ve done pretty well at that.","Scott Mushkin - Wolfe Research","Indeed. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Hi, thanks. , I wanted to follow up on the membership fee income. If my math is right, it was up a little over 7% in local currencies and so, is that right? About 3% per club.","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Could you help us understand what\u2019s driving that 3% per club? Is it at Executive membership shift? Is international? What\u2019s the bulk of that of 3% per club?","Richard Galanti","Executive membership is a good chunk of it. On an international basis, again I have to analyze little more. There is more sign-ups per location, although in some countries converted into dollars, it\u2019s a little less than 55. And of course, we don\u2019t have 110 in some of those countries. So I think it\u2019s probably the fact that we do get more sign-ups internationally is probably the biggest reason.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","But you think Executive is still a bigger portion of that than international if you had to then we will follow-up\u2026","Richard Galanti","If I had to guess, I would probably say half-and-half, I just don\u2019t know.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Fair enough, fair enough. Given the renewals internationally continue to improve, is there a threshold or how should we think about raising the fee in markets outside the U.S., given that we sort of know how it works in the U.S., the five to six-year pattern? How should we think about either a threshold or renewal rates or members per club where we start to model that in on the international side?","Richard Galanti","I don\u2019t know. I mean, we don\u2019t talk about it a lot. We like the fact that the new markets is recognizing. These new markets are also much smaller percentage of our total company. Thus we\u2019re to just drive business and drive signups. And we can worry about a little of that later. And so we look at it every year or so but spend all of about 10 minutes, look you had it and we\u2019ll see in the future. I mean, I don\u2019t see any preferred plans and making any major changes out there.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","So fair to say the focus internationally is still getting the sign-ups rather than trying to take the fee up?","Richard Galanti","I know, yes, I think that\u2019s not here on page 1, it looks 25 line page. I mean, the first order of business is opening units and getting into work right. And even in very successful countries and even with the support of its parents in the U.S., us, when you\u2019re going from 9 to now 20 units in Japan over two years. And going from three to six locations in Australia and a little over a year and a half, there is challenges. Nothing major, believe me, I think we have some -- every week, there is somebody from one of my departments going over to help out on something somewhere, which is good. But the same time, you always have some growing pains with that kind of stuff.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Great. And a little bit of a housekeeping, I think on the SG&A you mentioned workers comp hurt 3 basis points, is that?","Richard Galanti","Actually benefits the workers comp. I think workers comp was actually flatter slight, a very slight improvement year-over-year as percent. Benefit was the bigger culprit.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Benefits was the culprit for workers\u2019 comp held. Was there anything -- so that was a net figure to 3 basis points was benefits and workers\u2019 comp?","Richard Galanti","I think its like four and one, plus four and minus one. But benefits workers comp, we can always summarize together.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Got it. And then benefits trend looks like it sort of an ongoing thing as opposed to anything that \u2026.","Richard Galanti","Yeah. The one thing that helps it, I mean, we read about hospital cost or becoming less inflationary in the U.S. We -- and I talked to few other different types of companies at a recent meeting outside the Costco and we\u2019re not seeing below as low numbers. I think maybe on a per charge at a given hospital or a given doctor, something\u2019s might me lower if its only through the Medicare system as example. But some of the things that have been added like up to 26 year old instead of 18 to 22 based on if your kid is in college or not, your dependants, on mental and medical health priority no limits.","There is -- all these things have added, 1 and 1.5 percentage points to already large number. The thing that\u2019s frankly can help us more than that whether inflation is 5% or 10% or 3% and certainly if it comes down in the mid-to-lower single-digits that\u2019s a positive for us. But the bigger thing is the increasing penetration outside the United States, where healthcare cost as a percent of sales, respect to sales in that countries is lot less.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Got it. And then lastly on the gross margin, I think last quarter you\u2019ve talked about some of the gross margin about half of the hurts was self-inflicted or something you decided to do. It sounds like this is a quarter where you didn\u2019t -- you felt that there was -- even we decided to do that again. Am I summarizing that correctly?","Richard Galanti","Yeah. Again, I used the extreme example of the chicken. Again, we went from two years of an item that arguably represents several hundred million in sales of having very little of any margin to indicating that as underlying costs have come down a little bit, we didn\u2019t change the price. But we improved the margin a little bit. Its one item that probably impacted us incrementally by 3 or more basis points over the last couple of years and is now hoping in this some of that\u2019s reversing, not all of it. ","And we\u2019ll get a little increasing penetration overseas, helped you a little bit. I can feel that we don\u2019t try to get lower margin. We try to get lower prices but we still look to see where we get low.","Greg Melich - ISI Group","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.","Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research ","Good morning, Richard. If we are looking at what proteins are doing, especially some of the strong inflation we are seeing in certain categories. How are you seeing your members switching between those and what is that doing to your gross profit margin in the edible protein category?","Richard Galanti","I think from the last budget meeting, there was some switch from beef to poultry as you would not expect with the rising prices with beef. I don\u2019t have exact number. And I look at overall fresh fruits margin. Again accounts like would be for all down but dollar is up bigger surprise. I don\u2019t know if somebody had checked that detail.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","All right. And then just a quick follow-up with regards to Spain, anything worth pointing out there with regard to the product mix as you open up that's unique to Spain? ","Richard Galanti","And the pictures that I saw, there are certainly some unique local items of Spain and Europe. But generally speaking, the many of pictures that I saw, looked a lot like Costco that you would see. As you might expect, like any opening and certainly as a new opening in a new country, there are probably a lot of hot non-fruit items where we\u2019re able to pursue merchandize and really show great value of exciting stuff. But I\u2019m shooting from the hip with this answer.","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Got you. We both need to get over that.","Richard Galanti","Fair enough. ","Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with J.P. Morgan.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. Couple of quick model question. So by the nature of the LIFO calculation, you had a 7 basis point benefit last year in the fourth quarter, just by the fact that you have a benefit, does that end up being a negative this year in the fourth quarter?","Richard Galanti","No, that negative related to how it was versus the year before that. But we now start with that base of cost, if you will a year ago and really start with basis at the beginning of this fiscal year. And so how do prices trend? Again, using an index of 100.00 at beginning of times zero at the beginning of fiscal year and let say through the end of the third quarter I mentioned as an example like what I will call the food sundries pool, or what we call the foods pool, which is canned goods and cereals and things like that.","From the beginning of fiscal year, it was up 2.6%. If they go up or down a little in Q4 from that 102.6% number. It might be -- if we went down a tenth, it would be a LIFO credit in the quarter, even though there was a small offset to the big LIFO charge year to date for the first three quarters. So it's really, if you think about it, what\u2019s going to happen in Q4 is what the index was for all the pools at Q3 and what it will be 16 weeks in.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","But you mentioned that it was -- I understand, so sequential. So you also mentioned that price has accelerated in the back half of the quarter, so it sounds like it's more likely to be a negative.","Richard Galanti","It could be but it probably will be but I just don\u2019t know.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then on the buybacks, you bought back 1.6 million shares. The share count ticked down 0.1 sequentially. So just curious, was that more based on the timing of the buyback during the quarter or was there more of a big impact from the stock option exercising?","Richard Galanti","While, there is not a whole lot of stock option exercises. In fact, they are using the treasury stock method, that\u2019s kind of impulsive in the number anyway for options. If you have a big in-the-money option, which are remaining small amount of options that were granted in \u201905 I believe, so they expire in \u201915, \u201904 and \u201905 should expire this year and next year.","We\u2019re down to a very few left, like if you\u2019ve had a, making the math simple, if you had a $40 exercise price on a $120 stock price. For every option out there, you would exercise three of them and then buy one share back, so that would be a net increase of two shares. So that kind of number is not a big number. We\u2019ve bought stock during the quarter, relatively speaking, proportional during the course of the period.","So it was 1.6 million shares and my guess is that the rough subtraction to the total shares outstanding would be about a half a number of about 800,000. We said that calculation only went down 100,000. It would be some additional vesting since then on our issues. And to a very, very small extent, to the extent the stock price was a little higher versus a quarter ago and I don\u2019t know if it was or wasn\u2019t, that would maybe impacted a fair shape. But the big things would be roughly adding 800 and then subtracting -- I mean, subtracting 800 and then adding some due to just ongoing vesting of previous grants.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","I got you. And then last quarter you talked about your intent to buy back more stock, any thoughts on going forward here?","Richard Galanti","No, other than we started. Again, I don't want to be cute or coy. We continue to buy a little but we\u2019re not suggesting that. If you took the exact -- those nine weeks times, those shares, I think you get to a number in the $910 million year range. I don\u2019t know if it will be less or more and more than that next quarter on an annualized basis but it could be a little less, we\u2019ll just see. It\u2019s probably either less or little more but not a whole lot different. We will see.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","Okay. And then last one, just in terms of you had the Spain pressure and the pre-opening, as you look forward is sort of pre-open per store normalized back down to levels that we've seen historically?","Richard Galanti","Say that again? I\u2019m sorry.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","The pre-open, if I look at pre-opening expense, it ticked up partly because of Spain. As you look going forward, does the pre-opening dollars per store go back down to more normalized levels?","Richard Galanti","Yes, generally because there was clearly skewed because of Spain. To the extent that we opened more international, they tend to be a little higher. Assuming, we open in France next year and again, we don\u2019t know when they\u2019ll happen. There will be another real tick upward in that quarter.","Chris Horvers - J.P. Morgan","Understood. Thanks very much. ","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.","Matt Siler - Deutsche Bank","Hey guys. It\u2019s actually Matt for Paul. A lot of questions have been answered but I was just curious on online with some of the newer countries you are entering, you have a different plan in terms of the rollout of your online platform relative to the stores than you\u2019ve kind of done historically? Thanks.","Richard Galanti","Well, I mean, I know we\u2019re looking at another countries to open and countries where we operate. But I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a -- we haven\u2019t stated anything about when.","Matt Siler - Deutsche Bank","Thanks.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Richard Galanti","Well, thank you everyone and thank you for joining us.","Operator","And thank you.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the company does not undertake to update these statements except as required by law.","In today's press release, we reported operating results for the first quarter of fiscal '18, the 12 weeks ended November 26. Reported net income for the quarter came in at $640 million or $1.455 a share. That's a 17% increase compared to last year's first quarter results of $545 million or $1.24 a share. In comparing the year-over-year results, there were two items noted in today's release. First one, this year's first quarter had benefited from a $41 million or $0.09 a share income tax benefit related to a change in accounting rules for stock-based compensation.","And secondly, last year's first quarter results benefited from a non-recurring $51 million legal settlement. This $51 million figure represented a 19-basis point benefits in gross margin and a benefit to the first quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.07 a share. So excluding those two items, the reported 17% integration earnings would have been up 16%. A variety of other items impacted the year-over-year comparison. To the positive, gasoline profitability was higher year-over-year as was, to a lesser extent, incremental events, incremental benefit from our co-branded credit card program metrics. Offsetting these year-over-year positives were costs related to Hurricanes Irma and Maria and the slightly higher year-over-year normalized income tax rate, about 70 basis points.","Now turning to the income statement I'll start with a sales. Net sales for the first quarter were $31.12 billion, a 13.3% increase from last year's $27.47 billion, while this year's 12-week quarter included one less sales day in the United States than the first quarter of last year due to the calendar shift for Thanksgiving. Our pre-thanksgiving and Black Friday holiday weekend sales fell into the first quarter this year compared to a fall into the second quarter last year. Combined, these two factors produced an estimated net benefit to this year's first quarter sales results by an estimated 1.5% in the U.S. and about 1.3% worldwide.","As you saw on the released today, reported U.S. comparable sales increase was 10.3. Ex-gas and FX, the 10.3 was an 8.7. Canada was reported at 11.3, ex-gas and FX was a 4.3; Other International, a plus 10.1 reported, and ex-gas and FX, 8.2. All told, the total company was a 10.5 reported and a 7.9 after taking on the effects of gas inflation and FX. E-commerce, which we several months ago started reporting each month. For the 12 weeks, e-commerce comp sales were 43.5% up. And ex-gas inflation -- I'm sorry, ex-FX, it was a 42.1%. Now this number includes the holiday shift of Thanksgiving, but it's a little different than in-store because of Cyber Monday and we estimate that somewhere north of 5% and perhaps up to 10% of benefit and that number; so that 42 would come down a little bit if you'd normalized it. Still a very strong number. ","In terms of Q1 sales metric, first quarter traffic was up 5.9% worldwide and 6.6% in the U.S. Again, these two figures positively impacted by the Thanksgiving holiday shift as just discussed. FX impacted total sales by about 110 basis points and gasoline inflation contributed another 142 basis points. So gas and FX together for the entire company was about 2.5 percentage points, 250 basis points. As well, cannibalization weighed in on comps to the tune of minus 105 basis points. For the last several quarters, we've had more impact from that as we -- in several more reloads than we had done in the past. Average running transaction or ticket was 4.3%, and again, a little over half of that, which was the gas and FX benefit; so about a little over 2% normalized transaction figure. ","Next to the income statement, membership fees; Reported in Q1, $692 million, that's up $62 million or 9.8% year-over-year and seven basis points. Now that $62 million increase in fees, about $24 million of the $62 million increase related to membership fee increases. About 3\/4 of that $24 million membership fee increase benefit came from the fee increases we took in the U.S. and Canada effective June 1, 2017. And the balance from the fee increases taken in September of '16 or at the beginning of Q1 '17 and our other international operations, that is just back again to September of '16; but all told, that plus $24 million is in that plus $62 million. So ex that $24 million, we were still -- have been up 6% and up in the low-to-mid 5% range if you take out the FX benefit. We would expect, by the way, to see the impact of the fee increase based on how it impacts the income statement overtime with deferred accounting to continue to be even more positive year-over-year delta in the upcoming three or so quarters.","Our membership renewal rates were -- came in at 90.0% in the U.S. and Canada and 87.2% worldwide. These are the same renewal percentage figures we had at the end of the previous fiscal quarter at Q4 of '17. In terms of number of membership Q1 end -- in terms of total households, at Q4 end, we had 49.4 million. We ended Q1 in 12 weeks later with 49.9 million, up a little over -- up right at 1% during the 12 weeks. And total cardholders at Q4 end 12 weeks ago, we had 90.3 million cardholders, now 91.5 million. In terms of paid Executive Members, they stand at 18.8 million and that's an increase of about 246,000 over the past 12 weeks here. We are still being able to convert and add new Executive Members at the rate of about 21,000 a week in the quarter. In terms of -- and mentioned earlier, terms of membership portion release related to the recent annual increase, that year-over-year number will continue to increase and we'll share that with you in each quarter going forward.","Going down to the gross margin line. Our reported gross margin first quarter was lower year-over-year by 33 basis points. I'll ask you to just jot down two columns of numbers, not 4, just for first quarter and basically what we reported for Q1 '18, and the second column would be without gas inflation because that was impactful to understanding the numbers. The first line item is merchandise core. Year-over-year and on a reported basis, it was down 12 basis points. Ex-gas inflation, it was flat or 0. Ancillary businesses, plus 600 on a reported basis and plus 9, ex-gas inflation. 2% Reward, minus one basis point and minus two basis points. Other, minus 26 and minus 26. So all told in total on a reported basis, that was a minus three if you add up those numbers. And ex-gas inflation, it was minus 19.","Now overall, again, it was 33 excluding the 19 -- excluding the benefit from the non-recurring $51 million legal settlement last year, that was 19 basis points. Again, the total gross margin was lower year-over-year by 14 and was flat excluding gas deflation -- gas inflation. The core merchandise component margin was lower by 12, as you can see on the chart, but again, flat excluding gas price inflation for the quarter. And within the subcategories within core, food, sundries and soft lines merchandise departments, year-over-year in Q1 were up, and hard lines and fresh foods year-over-year were down.","The ancillary and other business gross margins, again, on the chart I just shared with you, plus 6 basis points and plus nine ex-gas inflation. Higher year-over-year margin contribution came from gas, hearing aids and hearing aids mostly, offset by lower year-over-year margin contributions and pharmacy, e-commerce and food court. In terms of the 2% Reward and the fact that, that hits margin by a little bit indicates the fact that we're still getting higher penetration of sales from members -- increasing penetration of sales from members that opted to become an Executive Member.","Lastly, in others, we had the positive non-recurring legal year-over-year settlement that was a 19 basis point number. Most of the rest is some incremental costs of this year primarily related to a new centralized return facilities. Going back two or three years ago, we tested this in one region, and in the last several months, we rolled out two the entire United States. And so there'll be some small incremental costs related to that, that hits the margin in each of the next couple of quarters.","Moving to reported SG&A; our SG&A percentage in Q1 year-over-year was lower or better by 34 basis points. More importantly, I think, ex-gas inflation, it was still better or lower by 20 basis points. Again, on a reported basis, it came in at 10.3 -- 10.36%. Doing the little chart again, the two columns reported and without gas inflation, core operations, lower or better by 24 basis points. Put a plus sign in front of that. And ex-gas inflation, plus 12. Central, plus 8, and ex-gas, plus 7; stock compensation, plus two and plus 1; total reported, lower or better, plus 34 basis points, and ex-gas, plus 20 basis points or lower by 20 basis points.","Now looking again at the chart, the operations component was lower or better by 24 basis points and better by 12 ex-gas inflation. This basically is a function of strong top line sales. As you know, we've reported in each of the last several months today in the quarter very strong sales, both in-store and online. Central expense also, lower by 8 basis points or seven without gas. Again, when we looked through all the detail, first and foremost, it is a strong sales results. No real surprises here. As we've been told, higher sales drive slower SG&A.","Next, for the income statement. Preopening, $5 million lower this year in Q1 coming in at $17 million compared to $22 million, really a function of opening schedule. This year in Q1, we opened seven openings, five net new openings plus two relows, all in North America. And last year in Q1, we opened 9, 8 of which were net new but nine openings, again, all in North America. All told, reported operating income in Q1 came in at $951 million, up $102 million or 12% higher year-over-year. And excluding the legal settlement, basically it was up -- would have been up $153 million from an adjusted $849 million last year, we are up 19% without that legal settlement. Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was up $8 million year-over-year at $37 million this year in Q1 compared to $29 million a year earlier. Higher year-over-year basically because of the result of the dead offering we did this past May in conjunction with our special dividend.","Interest in income and other was lower year-over-year by $4 million. Actual interest income in the quarter was better by $5 million; however, it was more than offset by about a $9 million impact, negative impact from FX contracts, FX-related items, not just contracts. Those fluctuate plus or minus that amount, it seems, each quarter based on how we manage foreign currency payables in to the countries around the world. Overall, pretax income was higher by 11% or $90 million in the quarter, coming in at $936 million, up $141 million or up 18% excluding the $51 million onetime legal settlement benefit last year in Q1. In terms of income taxes, our tax rate in Q1 '18 came in at 30.4% for the quarter, last year was 34.4%.","On a normalized basis, again, taking out that usual item that we've mentioned in the press today, last year's tax rate would have come in -- last year, there was a small incremental difference. Last year without normalized tax rate would have been a 34.1%, which would again have been lower by about 70 basis points than this year's normalized tax rate of 34.8%, taking that out item that we mentioned in the press release.","As I mentioned earlier in the call, again, we mentioned that positive discrete tax items this year. Overall, reported net income was higher by 17% coming in at $640 million compared to last $545 million. And again, excluding the two items, that's the one on the tax side, excluding the two items on the press release, net income would have been higher by 16 percentage points. A few other items of note before we turn it over to Q&A. Capital expenditures were $820 million and we would expect for the year for it to still be in the mid-to-high 2s, and depreciation at $335 million.","Warehouse expansion; so I think we've talked about somewhere between 20 and 25 openings. Over half of them will be in the U.S. We expect three in Canada, two in Korea and one each in Australia and Mexico. As well, we plan to relocate six warehouses this year, four in the U.S. and two in Canada. And that, again, compares to two or three a year in recent years. We will procure a few extra in fiscal '16 as well -- fiscal '17 as well. As of Q1 end, total warehouse square footage stood at 108 million square feet. In terms of stock buybacks, in all fiscal '17, we spent $473 million for just under 3 million shares at an average price of $157.87. In the first quarter, we repurchased 734,000 shares for $119 million or an average price of $162.51, and we will say we purchase more stock earlier in the fiscal quarter.","Now before I turn it back to Chrissie for Q&A, a quick update on e-commerce and our credit card relationship with Citi Visa. Worldwide, e-commerce sales for the first quarter of '18 were $1.3 billion, up 40% year-over-year. Again, somewhere between 5% and 10% benefit in the holiday shift. We continue to improve our offerings and we continue to improve our member experience with better sales, checkouts and returns processes. In the quarter, our site traffic conversion rates and traffic were up nicely year-over-year and we enjoyed basically stronger metrics for both the Thanksgiving, Black Friday week as well as Cyber Monday, which falls into Q2 this year versus -- falls in Q2 this year and last year.","Warehouses are supporting costco.com with signage used in search and purchase, and people can purchase for dot com items via members warehouses, selected items. Online grocery, as you know, at the call fiscal quarter ago, we talked about that week in first week of October, we introduced two new delivery options at Costco.com; a dry grocery two-day delivery and our same-day fresh -- the latter -- and also same-day fresh delivery through Instacart. Both of those rolled out early October. They've been positive to date while still in the soft openings\/limited marketing mode. We rolled out in Q1 '18. We added -- enhanced the value excited membership. Q1 '18, we have now members who are Executive Members purchasing from Costco travel who also received a 2% reward on all their travel purchases. And of course, with travel and the like on -- using their Citi Visa card, they get an additional 3%, so 5% between the 2.","We're also now offering a buy online, pickup in store in selected items, including jewelry and some laptop computers. We're seeing proper coming into pick them up and over half of them were shopping while they're there. Overall, all these efforts are having a positive impact on our business, both online and in the warehouse, and it results in greater sales momentum that increased awareness of our digital presence. As well as we've done quite a few things online to increase traffic in our warehouses. I think I shared a few of those with you the last time, whether it's hot price on USDA choice prime steak to the back-to-school Labor Day weekend. And so we think that we can use the Internet and online and e-mails to drive traffic both ways.","In terms of Citi Visa Anywhere card; when the conversion to Citi Visa occurred back in June of '16, there were 11.4 million co-branded cards or 7.4 million accounts. Those were transferred over to Citi for the conversion. As of Q1 end, we now have 2.1 million new approved member accounts or 2.8 million new cards of there. And that includes about 263,000 new accounts opened during the 12-week first quarter. We continue to be pleased with the adoption utilization of the card to date and it's been overall very good for us and our partners.","Lastly, our fiscal '18 second quarter scheduled earnings release date for the 12-week second quarter ending February 18, this again will be after the market close on Wednesday, March 7. However, earnings call that afternoon at two P.M. so we'll release the earnings shortly after the market closes and at the top of the next hour do the call.","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions with Christy. Back to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS.","Michael Lasser","Richard, are you now at -- is membership for club now at a growth level that can be sustained from here? And whether any unit promotions that contributed to the growth in that method that you experienced during the quarter?","Richard Galanti","I think the biggest thing, if you go back a few quarters ago where it was that average came down a little bit, it's composed of two primary things, well, 3: Number of openings, and certainly they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year; two, we have huge memberships sign-ups in certain new markets, particularly Australia, Asia, Iceland was off the charts, great, and so when those compared to in the U.S. and Canada where we have been forever; and so those time, as you may get. And then when we add new unit to an existing market, and I gave a couple of example of that last time, that will tend -- you know, we might have 65,000 members per warehouse in three locations in the east side of Seattle here or in the San Jose area; I think those are two examples I gave you. We opened up a new unit, which adds $120 million, $130 million of incremental sales, but only adds literally a few thousand additional members because you now have members that are shopping more frequently because we're closer to them; and so that will continue to happen.","The timing of openings, as I've said, that will be up and down. I think overall, the number -- the metric did come up both last quarter and this quarter year-over-year for the first time and we're adding some new markets as well. That will help us. My guess is the average, if you take the total number of warehouse at quarter end and divided by the total number of locations, I mean, this is in the low 60s, it will probably remain plus or minus that a little bit. To the extent it was a little less, we'll look at it and say, well, usually the reason is there were less year-over-year openings in a few of these international markets. We feel very good about our renewal rates and so far so good on what we've felt the impact of the credit cards switch and the auto bill, and so, so far so good.","Michael Lasser","In the past, you've given a little bit more detail on renewal rate by Gold Star Primary Business that was your cohort. Is there any reason why you decided not to give that detail?","Richard Galanti","I think the biggest reason, over the years for some of you on this call noticed for 20 or 25 years doing this, and we've gotten so granular, it almost has become a distraction. Rest assured, anything that is impactful, we're going to make sure that you know about. But at the end of the day, what's important is total number of members and growth, existing renewal rates, of course. And part of the other challenges is for years, we've had -- early on in our career, wholesale member, you have to have a bona fide business license and truly was a small business owner. And then that evolved into a business mentorship where you have business add-ons, and many of those were not for business purposes but small business with 10 members, with 10 employees and the employer bought the membership for his or her employees.","And then after that, with the Executive Membership coming on, those people would get off of that primary membership and have their own membership. So we know more about our business member versus not based on what they're buying than anything else.","Michael Lasser","And then my follow-up question this on the potential for tax reform. Would you treat any savings that you might get from potential tax reform as any other windfall that you get and reinvest that back in the business in the form of price, lower prices?","Richard Galanti","Well, first, we have to wait and see what actually happens. I know in the first year, what we're reading about today, there's still some onetime offset to that for earnings overseas, historical earning overseas to the extent of that cash hasn't come back. That will be a partial offset, I believe, to what we currently read today. Look, going forward, we're going to do what's long term right for our stockholder's quarter's valuation. And for us, that includes all of the things you've heard about historically. But we'll have to wait and see and talk about it more when you get there.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chuck Grom from Gordon Haskett.","Charles Grom","Just on the gross margins, I think you said the quarter-on-quarter was flat. I was wondering if you could shed some color there on the Visa benefit? And then also what the total core was as a percentage of their own sales? If you could just amplify on any of the category color on direction that you gave earlier.","Richard Galanti","Yes. Getting back to the previous person's question about why respond with a granularity, the big benefits were in the first year. There was some incremental benefit, but going forward, we're really not going to specify the detail. Needless to say, incrementally, it was a lot lower than going from nothing to the big benefit that we got in the first 12 months and that we'll continue to get and the good news is it's growing us percent of sales. In terms of core encore, I think it was down few basis points. I don't have that detail in front of me.","And again, I know that was a big question last -- I was about to say last semester, last quarter, compared to prior quarters. There's so many moving parts. What I can tell you is we feel very good about our margins. There are a lot of the stuff that we have done and we'll continue to is offensive and not defensive and we are probably the biggest prize that's worth as good if not better than we thought it was going to work.","Charles Grom","Okay, great. And then just any early readings with Instacart? I know when you did Google Express that most of the purchases were falling trips and were therefore complimentary. I was just curious what your early takes are with that effort.","Richard Galanti","Look, all the members are great partly because they expanded themselves in terms of the number of locations over the last 12 months. Two, its front and center now on our website. But one of the things I mentioned here, we both have chosen for the first two-three months for this thing to basically have a soft opening, if you will, to make sure that we don't screw it up. And when I say we don't screw it up, it's growing very nicely. But clearly, when we market it, we think it will take off even more. But so far, so good.","Charles Grom","Okay. So then when you look at the acceleration in digital sales in November, that was really just your core Costco.com business?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim.","John Heinbockel","The thought of starting with jewelry and PCs, what sort of drove that? How far can you take that operationally? Right, if you think about other products like big bulky stuff, papers and beverage, can you do that operationally? And then is that what your customers want? Are you hearing from numbers that they want more bulk items?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, we haven't heard from a lot of members. I'm not so sure that -- we have not asked them either, by the way, but we do see the strength in our numbers particularly in store. I mean, the online is fantastic, but in-store is maybe 5% of our business. When we look at doing it our way, we still scratch our head about doing what -- even consider doing what some of the others are doing, not just other warehouse clubs, but other retailers. There's a lot of cost to that. So far, we haven't seen a reason to do that. In the case of these couple of categories, what we found is that there are people that won't buy it because they don't want -- they can't have it shipped to their office or their place of work and they don't want it left at their doorstep. And so here's a way for them to buy it and we saw a nice piece of business being done that way.","And as you might expect, since we're not going to be over to pick up the groceries that we bought and put for the refrigerated stuff in the refrigerator and the frozen stuff in the freezer, they just go up to the cage and get this. Over half of them went in at shopped before they pick up their laptop or their jewelry. So that's what we like and we'll keep evolving it and we'll see, it's just the start.","John Heinbockel","And then the -- when you think about tenure of openings here, right, so do you think we are more at the low end of that 20 to 25? And obviously we have sort of haven't done many in Asia of late. Is that just the way the real estate timing folds and we're going to get a surge in overseas openings on the next 18 months? And then I think you're doing just one business center this year, is that right?","Richard Galanti","Only one business center this year?","Unidentified Company Representative","We've already opened up San Francisco, so we have one at Minnesota, maybe...","Richard Galanti","We'll have at least two this year, having open one already and maybe a third. That's just a matter of timing. I think it's clearly in the list right after the fiscal year. A lot of that has to do with timing. In terms of the 20 to 25, history would suggest we are at the lower end versus the higher end. There were a couple -- and the real difference is that things that don't have on the plate already, it's -- can we push them, can we move, do we get lucky with the weather if we push a couple of days on different hurdles like with permits or whatever.","John Heinbockel","And then just lastly, are you also -- you talked about the gas benefit. Was that de minimis or how big was that?","Richard Galanti","Well, we're trying to -- there's no good time to get a less granular, but when you add them all up, it was the biggest line to the bottom line but at the end of the day, gas is good, there have been some quarters. If you looked at the last 8 or 12 quarters which I haven't looked at, it's probably more than a $0.01 and there have been quarters when it was $0.05; and it could be anything whether there or little on either side of that. Needless to say, they were good.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Karen Short from Barclays.","Karen Short","First, just a housekeeping question. What was inflation in the quarter? Could you give that?","Richard Galanti","No, we didn't. Overall, ex-gas and maybe the best was up a couple of percentage points. We don't really look at LIFO anymore. We had it, but we don't look at it. Our guests -- I think, if there was anything that's maybe ex-gas, there was a tiny amount of inflation. But that was on the cost side. Investing on price and given the competition that you see from other retailers out there, my guess is there is probably little if any inflation.","Karen Short","Okay, so that was [indiscernible], it's done a lot of -- I mean, PPI has clearly been high, I mean up and elevated, while TTI has been a lot more muted. So I guess, that's -- I'm wondering how much that impacted your margins? Or how do we think about that in terms of\u2026","Richard Galanti","I really don't think that impacted it, Karen. It's really us looking at what happens when we get hot on pricing or hotter and recognizing we have these benefits from credit card and from membership. And that's what we do.","Karen Short","Okay. And then I guess, in terms of grocery delivery and then Instacart, I guess, you didn't give an update. Are you still at the 500 SKUs for grocery delivery and 1.700 on Instacart? And then anything to indicate on that component of the business, whether or not this is drawing a customer who has kind of been dormant? Now you're seeing incremental trips; anything it could point to because obviously the concern is that there will be cannibalization with this offering.","Richard Galanti","We really haven't. I mean, it's still -- even though they are big increases in what they're doing today before the day after with us going back to in early October, it was miniscule relative to our company size. We'll wait six months and then take a look at it.","Karen Short","Okay. And then lastly, how many units on focus right now?","Richard Galanti","I'm sorry, how many units?","Karen Short","Are on the buy online, pick up in store for those smaller items?","Richard Galanti","Very limited. Hold on, hold on. All warehouses are doing jewelry and laptops in U.S.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley.","Simeon Gutman","Richard, first on membership, could you talk about how successful the couple of promotions that you ran in the quarter and how it performed relative to other ones you've done in the past? And just generally, is the environment -- the competitive environment for club membership any different than it's been in the past?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, I'm not sure what we did this first quarter. During Q4, we did the Groupon\/mini social. That went fine but I'm not sure of anything we did this quarter.","Simeon Gutman","Okay, what about the environment? Is it any different as far as competitors being promotional for new members? Is there anything to call out versus what it was like in the past?","Richard Galanti","I don't think they're more promotional, but our direct competitors have been very promotional one more than the other. But whether it's a monthly one or a certain amount of dollars off to try it out, and so we haven't really seen any dramatic differences to that. It's been that way for a while.","Simeon Gutman","Okay. My follow-up is on the online sale. You gave it a bit of color, I don't know if you talked about categories that are out comping the house average. Are there any gross margin implication of the categories? I realize there is still a range even within a pretty tight band, but curious, just thinking about the products that are growing faster than the house online versus others, if that's doing anything for the gross margin?","Richard Galanti","Well, yes. But keep in mind, with all these wonderful growth, it is still very smart -- it's less than 5% of our company so it doesn't have that big impact to the overall company. Electronics, it probably does because we've been very successful online with electronics. And given the white club service, hopefully, members understanding that if they are an executive member and may have the flow brand card, they'll get an extra 5% off and they get a four-year warranty that includes using the co-brand card. So all those things will help drive the business notwithstanding we have to let everybody know. And I think apparel has been good, but part of that so that we are doing more apparel online. And I think we're also getting better with a small B on targeting certain types of e-mails to members to do some of these things.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Dan Binder from Jeffrey's.","Daniel Binder","So first question was on the Visa cardholder. I was just curious, you're over a year and now. Do you have any comparative data on how that cardholder spending in the club versus the MX holder previously?","Richard Galanti","The only thing I'd look at -- I don't know that. The only thing -- in many cases, it is the same number. We believe you have a higher spend because of a better rewards, better promotions. The fact that Visa is accepted in more places, if it is your top of wallet, old reward card, co-branded card, it was my top of wallet and now the new Citi Visa is. There are many more places I can use my new one, and so that's driven more outside spend. And the beauty of co-branded programs with big companies, whether it's airline, retail, hotel, travel, is that there's some revenue share there. So those are the metrics we look at.","We also, of course, double the reward on Costco purchases, gas more, not a double, but everything else used to be one and now it's two. So all of those things are helping us trend in the right direction there.","Daniel Binder","And then with regard to renewal rates, you highlighted of the renewal rate was same as where we were at the end of the fourth quarter. I know last quarter, you're talking about the trajectory and how you think it will follow your experience in Canada. Do think that next quarter, we could see the first tick up in renewal rates?","Richard Galanti","I think a quarter ago, we said one or two quarters. And so we have one more quarter of flat to -- we're talking about tenths of a percentage point, half a tenth is what we'll average it up or down. We want to hedge our bets here a little bit. But we believe this in the case, but we've got one more quarter of free pass here but we were pleased with what we saw in Q1 compared to Q4 end.","Daniel Binder","And then lastly, do you have any numbers around membership growth in comp stores?","Richard Galanti","No, we don't. Only because we did that last quarter because we know there was a lot of concerns around it, we thought that was a data point. And I'm sorry, we just don't have that.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers from JP Morgan.","Christopher Horvers","So on the core margin being flat ex-gas, usually when you're going to these periods of intimate piece of the renewal, the membership fee increase. It tension investing gross margin and I think most expected it to be down. So going back to a prior question, is mix helping you? The price environment is pretty promotional out there solid just trying to understand why that came in flat versus through the historical experience of how you would invest and to the fee increase period.","Richard Galanti","Look, our philosophy is we invest in this stuff. We are also pragmatic. There's a lot out there, but I think we have a benefit also. We could take -- given our limited nature, limited number of items, we could just do some hot buys on a limited number of items that are truly wow, and drive sales and item at extra $10 million or $20 million in a week or a few weeks. And so it seems to work for us, we feel good that we've got -- we're looking at this stuff offensively and we'll see how we use it.","Christopher Horvers","And then in terms of the following up on the tax question, you talked about doing what's right for the shareholders, the valuation of the stock, and historically, I think your motto is customer employee vendor shareholder. So is that the way how we should think about that potential tax flow through?","Richard Galanti","We got crazy a little bit, sure, I mean, yes, we're going to keep doing what's right. And again, I'm noting try to be cute. First of all, we don't know what the tax plan is going to do and we don't know the impact on first year of it based on some offsets. But you can rest assure that we'll do the right thing and we'll drive the business the way we do it that helps of those stakeholders.","Christopher Horvers","And then lastly, just a couple of quick follow-ups. This in the calendar, this the 53rd-week end up being a point on headwind for this upcoming quarter? And the other line, we think, gross margins, I think you said 26 basis points. When you say some of that is going to stick around for the next three quarters, is that 26 basis points or something like that?","Richard Galanti","No, no. Within the 26 is 19 of that 26 was that $51 million legal settlement benefit to gross margin in Q1 of '17 a year ago. So year-over-year was minus 19 basis points. So we're talking about is the other 7, and the other seven has primary do with a major switch we did and how we hand over, return and dispose of salvaged merchandise. And we tested it for a couple of years in one of two regions, one region than another. And then just the last six or seven months we rolled it out through the United States to selling all 12 depots that do this for us that can handle the entire United States. And needless to say, we did because it works, since it's positive.","There's the start-up cost if you will of getting it rolled out and done in the efficiencies that we look for overtime. That seven hopefully will be 6, 5, 4, 3; but a year from now it will be zero in theory and then go the other way a little bit. But at the end of the day, we wanted to point it out because it is a little unusual and we recognize that you guys are very sensitive to these basis points of margin.","Christopher Horvers","And then 1.5 point sale shift?","Richard Galanti","That's for Q2.","Christopher Horvers","That is a headwind?","Richard Galanti","Yes, that will be a headwind, yes. And it will be a bigger headwind for e-commerce because we don't know if it's 5% or 10% probably in the high singles; that's a guess.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo.","Edward Kelly","Can I just ask about traffic; it wasn't that long ago, I guess, that traffic slipped to kind of 2% or so and we were also thinking maybe this is the new norm. Obviously, you have seen dramatically better traffic growth this year. I guess, like just thinking about things in hindsight, was there something unusual about that period of 2016? And then as we think about things going forward, is there anything really that would cause things to set to that kind of level again given the levers you now have to pull in this business, whether it's the fee increase or tax or whatever it might be?","Richard Galanti","I think a little of it has to do with credit cards switch leading up to June of '16 for about nine months, prior from June 16 backwards. We didn't sign up any new members, but we had American Express agreed, there's no sense signing up selling for a card that's going to go away in June of 2016. And so there's probably some negative impact and confusion, and the confusion probably into the first few weeks of the new card given it was a overnight transition which was faded in behind. And -- so I think that probably had -- it certainly wasn't a positive impact, my guess is it was a little bit of a smaller impact. I think, it's -- I remember when those numbers were coming down, we were asked, and like you just said, we said maybe it's just normal, we don't know; we felt good about our business and one of the things we did is how should we get it more excited out there and part of that was the pricing and the like.","So I -- we also had a little bit of hiccup from a traffic standpoint with the multi-vendor mailers. If you recall, the good thing is it's pure items with greater values and more sales than an MBM. However, the offset to that was we probably dug a little bit deeper than we should have in terms of fewer MVM days and during the course of the year. And we saw that impact basically December of '16 to February or March of '17, so pretty much Q2 of fiscal '17. And then as we said on that Q2 call, which was a disappointing quarter, we said it's easy, we'll change it back, we'll add some more days. We kept the lower fewer items and the greater values and that's working nicely, but we have more days and so we had less and where we had tweaked a little bit too much, we've had fewer MVM days or higher traffic helping days. We were back to pretty much normal in that, maybe a few less, but nothing that really impacts us.","Edward Kelly","Just a follow-up on tax format. I know it is a difficult question to ask, but maybe we think about it in like bigger picture sense of investment and how you think about driving sales. And as you think about sort of like where you'd like to spend money particularly if you were to potentially get some windfall, everyone sort of thinks about price, but are there other things that sort of like would really like to have but are expensive? Or an earnings headwind currently that makes the return calculation a little different, whether it's the enhanced digital or fulfillment or something on labor.","Just figure out, are there other areas of business besides just price you should be thinking about that you would like to invest if you had the opportunity?","Richard Galanti","First of all, I would like to think we would be doing those anyway. We have strong cash flow. As you know, we generate cash flow well in excess of our CapEx and keep increasing the regular dividend, have done the specials a few times and brought back stuff to at least cover more than, frankly, cover that, which over 5,000 employees get as part of the compensation. And so I'd like to think that -- I don't think we're going to sit around the table and say we have this big box of money and what would we do we are not prepared to do yesterday.","I know -- now as we said, I think you'll see us do what we do well. It's merchandising and driving business and taking care of our employees and also taking care of our shareholders. I'm not trying to be cute. We don't know what we're going to do yet because we first we have to figure out what can actually happen.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Fassler","Couple of follow-ups; one on the calendar shift, can you talk about whether it was a particularly profitable 1.5 of sales? Clearly, you're going to do a lot more sales per day and probably per employee hour. I'm not sure what the margin profile that you generate on that week so any impact on operating margin rate from that shift and presumably whatever it was would reverse in the following quarter.","Richard Galanti","This is -- I'm shooting from the hip on this one. Look, having extra strong sales in a warehouse on that day, they are more profitable as a percentage of pretax because you already budgeted your labor and is busier. We kind of know on the other end, hopefully we budget properly there so maybe it won't dramatically offset. But I don't -- We're talking about a few weeks here and there, I don't think it is a big deal either way.","Matthew Fassler","Okay. And then another question, you asked on e-commerce about profitability related to category shift. If you think about the growth of the business, you think about some of the accommodations you're making and the incremental offers that you are providing, can you talk a bit about the gross margin profile of e-commerce in total? I think you addressed them briefly, I think, as part of the gross margin discussion. Any sense as to the direction and they also know it's small, you made that point as well. Just as it gets bigger, is the direction you're taking it in and moving to gross margin category with the other through that channel, just, is what I should say?","Richard Galanti","First of all, gross margins in e-commerce even two years ago was a little lower than the warehouse, but yesterday was a lot lower than warehouse. So the bottom line was a lot higher than the warehouse, recognizing it wouldn't exist if it's in another warehouse. So it's all one big happy family there. At the end of the day, what we have found and what everybody else found before us probably is if we can figure out and we have, we think, figure out how to communicate effectively with our members on some particularly hot buys, it really drives business, and not just online. And so I think there is enough -- we have so much, in my view, flexibility and comfort in our margin. And because we're not being -- our views is our margin, whether it's a basis point lower or basis point higher is because of what we wanted to do, not because we're impacted by losing something to someone else. I think we're fortunate in that regard.","And even with very competitive products, hydraulics is very competitive, we over-indexed to higher end stuff. It's all competitive everywhere, but within the electronics here, it is probably a little better, a little less competitive, which makes us look better. So there's so many -- we have, in my view, there's so many buckets we can pull from. I don't see that as a big thing to worry about analyzing the structure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.","Paul Trussell","Just to follow-up on the e-commerce conversation. You had a series of announcements on the last few calls, including partnerships in the buy online, pick up on store Costco grocery. I just want to take a step back real quick, Richard, and if you could just talk overall kind of your mindset and approach to e-commerce and kind of omnichannel and what's kind of led to -- I think, a lot of us view this as a bit of a term in the narrative in the way that you all have kind of approached the business historically.","Richard Galanti","I think we still done things our way and we continue to evolve. Needless to say, there's a lot of views out there, like several people on the phone here, and there's a range of views. I think what we've hopefully communicated is that in our own way, there's lots of little buckets out there and low-hanging fruit that we haven't touched. Perhaps we should've touched some of them earlier, who knows. But we seem to be running on many cylinders here and the things we're doing our work in. Importantly, not only through e-commerce or omnichannel, but for in-store and driving business that way as well. We feel fortunate in that regard. It was funny, I remember on the last earnings call three months ago when we talked for the first time about the two new delivery options on grocery, on Costco.com site, these two links.","And on the one hand, there's some out there that viewed this, yes, they cleared it out. There's others saying they had to do this because somebody else is wrong. Our view is we are kind of doing it pretty well first and foremost with driving our brick-and-mortar business, understanding that some of it was going to evolve in respect of this. We believe we were very successful with big-ticket items, furniture, big-ticket like electronics. What was evolving already 10 years ago online even with us was light club service on things you had to install or build like a patio set or swing set or a big thing television.","One of the things we talked about last quarter was white goods. Over the last several months, we've improved our direct relationships with LG and Samsung rather than trying to -- rather historically when we were doing white goods not terribly well with just a little bit of a couple of item, not with the highest end stuff that we could sell in store. All of a sudden, we have great value, incredible value plus extra award, all that stuff if you use your Visa card. And we think we can take an item that was well under $100 million sales in a matter of few years be $1 billion. Now $1 billion is still just under a percent of sales, but it's $1 billion.","There is a lot of things we're able to do in this tough new world. I'd mentioned before apparel, where brick-and-mortar apparel is flat or down. And total apparel, including online, is up a few percentage points. We've got worldwide $7 billion -- close to $7 billion apparel business that's compounded in the last three-plus years over 9%. Two reasons, growth in signature and weakness in brick-and-mortar, and some manufacturer willing to sell to us for the first time, so suppliers. And amazing pricing; so we'll keep doing that.","Paul Trussell","That makes sense. And also in looking at your strong top line over the last few months, it's occurred globally. You spoke a bit about kind of the investments in price on some of the product on the U.S. front. Is that the same story in what's happening in Canada and other places around the world? Or other any kind of unique factors that we would attribute some of these in those regions, too?","Richard Galanti","It's everywhere. The fact that the warehouse club concept is newer in some of those countries, the fact that we're opening more new units, we opened one unit in Sylvia, it's in Seville, Spain. Smaller market than Madrid, but you had vendors, even international vendors and certainly local vendors, that would not -- were a little crazy, they knew how big we are, and if we comment, it would be great; but they have a lot of customers that weren't drilled. Once we get that second one opened, it helps in the first one as well. We see the same thing happen in Australia in the first few years and again it gets back to we are in sourcing and global supply company.","And clearly, with eight or so locations in Australia, we bring the purchasing power of $130 billion retailer to that market and that helps us as well. And I think the fact that our first signature items have become a high end, and incredibly low priced brand, incredibly high-value brand, that helps us as well.","Paul Trussell","And lastly, for me quickly, I might have missed it, but from the Visa card, did you outline any particular benefit to gross margins or SG&A in this quarter?","Richard Galanti","Well, for the first four quarters since it was so large going from the prior program to what this great new program has done for us, we did. And going forward, we aren't. We did say that incrementally, it was a little benefit percentage-wise.","Operator","Next questions comes from the line of Kelly Bania of BMO.","Kelly Bania","Just curious on the SG&A line, you mentioned some incremental cost to think about over the next few quarters. Can you quantify that at all for us? And in terms of the shift, was there an impact, the calendar shift, to SG&A or membership or any other line items in the quarter?","Richard Galanti","There's about little things. I mean, first of all, in terms of the shift, to help you -- as Matt asked early about the extra percentage half, it helps a little bit, but it's hard to quantify. This a little bit of shift with some holiday pay issues, but you're talking about, my guess is a small amount of basis points. The thing is the first part of the question you asked was about this thing and it will continue for the next few quarters; that's a margin item. That had to do with us changing the way to make it, frankly, more efficient and less costly for handling returns. And doing it centrally, if you will, at each of 12 depots across the country in the United States. Talking about U.S., we started -- we tested this for the first time probably three years ago; and over the last six months we went from two to 12 depots, added 10 of them.","And so there was about -- that was much of that extra, that line item that was 26 basis points of which 19 was the one-time thing from last year. Those other seven basis points, much of that is that, but that's a margin hit; and so that will be a little bit of a margin hit in the upcoming, probably two or three quarters. I'm hoping it will dwindle a little bit, but that would be what it will be.","Kelly Bania","Great. And then just on online with the acceleration online of grocery, just curious if you have any -- based on what you've seen so far, it's been very successful with just even a soft launch. So you mentioned getting deeper into using some e-mail and some targeted e-mail. Just curious, what else can we expect to come from online? Do you have any plans for adding an auto replenishment feature? Anything you can share with us on that would be great.","Richard Galanti","First of all, with regard to like -- delivery, we have done no marketing effort per say, so it truly has been a soft opening, both on our part and in the case of same-day grocery, on Instacart's part, we want to get it right. Percentage-wise, it's going crazy but it's very small, small amount of business relative to our company. Well, even with the comments I made about the laptops and the jewelry, that's the test. We looked at it and of course, we've been asked a hundred times, what about order online pick-up in store, we scratched our head in recognizing our places are a lot busier than others. We don't see how that makes sense and we don't hear a lot of members asking about it but we look at it and said where are some areas where it makes some sense and so we're trying.","Tires that make sense and that's been very successful over the last year, year and a half where you can order the tires online to go to the location that you want them installed at, your traditional warehouse that you shop at; and that's driven -- in our view, that's driven volume to the tire business for us.","Kelly Bania","Any from the auto replenishment?","Richard Galanti","No comment at this point. We'll let you know if and when we decide. We're looking at that and some other things.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of David Schick [ph] from Consumer Edge.","Unidentified Analyst","We talked a lot about digital and what you're trying digitally. My question is what you're seeing digitally in e-commerce, is that causing any merchandising decisions, pushed anything back to the club? Are you noticing anything in those trends that could change your merchandising? Thank you.","Richard Galanti","Yes, I mean, one thing that we've done is we've done a better job of e-mailing people to get them into the warehouse; I mentioned the New York strip steaks [ph]. We've also done some items that -- if you bought in-store a baby seat, car seat, the banner that's at the top of your e-mail includes some hot items or if you bought tires, the banner includes some automotive or garage items. Some of those are online and some of them are in-store; the tires, I just mentioned. And in terms of -- right now, what we're doing is high-fiving each other, it's working to drive business in-store and drive business online.","Unidentified Analyst","Just -- any update on the wage outlook, you guys have stayed ahead of it and been very transparent with it. But just talking about the wage outlook now, 90 days since your last quarter.","Richard Galanti","No, we feel good about that. We've taken -- of course, we took up wages throughout using the U.S. as a base here. We took about year and a half ago, March of '16 and in several markets we started people a little higher than that where we have to. Some parts of the Bay Area, some parts of New York, and there are only a couple of cities, Seattle and San Francisco, where there's a minimum of 15, but rest assured we'll stay ahead of the game a little bit.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research.","Scott Mushkin","So a couple housekeeping items and then a question. I don't think we've talked about much about inflation, or if we did, I missed it, and I wonder what the inflation would look like in the quarter, what's your outlook?","Richard Galanti","Yes, we did talk briefly about it. Look, we think it's up a little, but it's muted by the fact that driving better value. And so really not a big issue either way. Next question.","Scott Mushkin","The cost of hurricanes, that's the other -- there was a cost, I didn't hear what you said what the cost was.","Richard Galanti","We try to be a little less granular because if there are some offsetting things of there. The two together were a couple of $0.03 in total, but that's the difference. I'm learning not to tell you stuff.","Scott Mushkin","My last -- my real question is, when you take a step back and we talked about e-commerce forever, the Amazon impact that concerns about it, you historically, said we want people in our stores, we don't believe in a lot of this stuff, particularly the buy online and the Quicken collect types of businesses. The -- you want people in your stores or your warehouses. I guess, just from a philosophical perspective since your sales are so darn strong, why are you guys moving aggressively with some of the e-commerce, these e-commerce trials or you're just rolling it out? It seems that if I look at it over time, it could be harmful to keeping people in your warehouses.","And I just wanted to know philosophically what made you guys changed your mind and why you're doing it?","Richard Galanti","Well, first of all, I think, well, we want to be responsive and we want to make sure that we're not being stubborn about things but we also want to do it our way. I think we've gotten comfortable, there are some things we can do that we think can drive our total company sales and profitability without impacting and also recognize that if we have 3,800 -- an average about 3,800 items in-store, maybe we have twice that online, this is a rounding year for everybody else in terms of what they offer to customers in terms of items. And so we have to see or how to do it and still have the value of what we do. And so I think -- we've also figured out how to do it without spending hundreds of millions of dollars.","We are -- the two-day drive grocery -- up to two-day drive grocery that we're doing to a handful of our depots which covers essentially the entire United States, we're able to do that pretty cheaply because we are already allowing business members to run the business and not depots but the business centers, because you can already buy it online and have it delivered. But we brought in about -- just under 500 items that were more retail consumable type items. So our view is these are relatively inexpensive ways to try things and they're working, we do have to kind of first -- we have to measure how we do going forward if we love for orders -- on grocery orders online to be filled in, not stop you from coming; we've recognized it you may come a few less times during the year. How do we change that?","And we also recognized there is people that live 30 to 60 minutes away from us, sometimes that's 10 miles, sometimes that's 40 miles and that's been a big move for us where we see this could help. So again, life has changed on big-ticket, big sized items and items that you've got to install, and in many cases items that you want somebody else to take the old mattress or the old refrigerator away. So we can show -- we've got nothing, some confidence in those areas that we can show the best value on the high-end stuff in those areas as well.","So I think it's all working probably a little better than we thought it would.","Scott Mushkin","Alright, I appreciate the answer and I'd give a shot out to that tire program, it's actually -- it's pretty good. Anyway, have a good holiday.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research.","Charles Cerankosky","I just wanted to see if you could take sort of a 30,000-foot view and talk about how the mix is different and changing as these economies improve, not only in the U.S. but maybe also on Canada and the rest of your operations?","Richard Galanti","Bigger ticket items, jewelry I think, has improved. Electronics, expanded electronics, not just computers or laptops or iPads, tablets and televisions but the whole audio side. Audio is everything from these boxes that you put outside, telephones and jewelry. So I think from a -- is the economy getting better? Who knows; certainly, there is money out there to be spent on the stuff and we have seen some pickup in those areas, and the Internet helped out a little bit.","Charles Cerankosky","By Internet, you mean e-commerce?","Richard Galanti","Yes.","Charles Cerankosky","Great, thank you.","Richard Galanti","Well, thank you, everyone, and we'll be around. Happy holidays.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That concludes today's conference call. You all may now disconnect."]}}
