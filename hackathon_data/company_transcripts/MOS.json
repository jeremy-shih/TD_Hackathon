[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Rich will share his insights into our results and our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, February 11, 2015, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko","Good morning to you all. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings meeting. A year ago, on our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call, I said the following: We're starting to see some rays of sunlight at the end of this tunnel, and Mosaic is well positioned for the daylight to come. Well, our predictions don't always come true, but in this case, it's very gratifying to be proven right. The sunlight was real and Mosaic was, and is, in excellent position to benefit in better parts of the business cycle.","Given that we updated our earnings expectations in mid-January, we realized our results don't come as a surprise. So today, we will focus on the drivers behind our strong finish to the year and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015.","Our key messages for today are: First, our earnings are beginning to reflect the leverage we've built into the business through our many strategic moves. I want to emphasize that we outperformed expectations without significant appreciation in prices for our products or in the prices of grains and oilseeds.","Second, robust demand for our products and good execution were the primary drivers of our earnings, and we expect global demand to remain strong in 2015.","And third, we are successfully executing our strategic initiatives and many of them are now fully operationalized.","For the quarter, Mosaic earned $361 million or $0.97 per share, including a positive impact of $0.10 per share of notable items, an increase of roughly threefold from a year ago. Our revenues for the quarter were $2.4 billion, up 9% over the fourth quarter of 2013. Both of Mosaic's business segments outperformed our expectations.","In Phosphates, our volumes exceeded the top of our initial guidance range by 450,000 tonnes as customers sought to position inventory in anticipation of a strong spring application season. The Phosphates segment generated $286 million in gross margin and improved its gross margin rate to 18.2% during the quarter.","The Potash segment exceeded our gross margin guidance by several percentage points as cost per tonne dropped and we operated at very high operating rates, mostly because of a highly successful Canpotex proving run at Colonsay.","We also continued to generate strong operating cash flow of $382 million during the quarter, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $2.3 billion, an almost $300 million improvement over 2013. We are putting our cash to use by continuing to invest in the business, both organically and strategically, and repurchasing our shares. And we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.","For the full year of 2014, we delivered good results despite the choppy market conditions throughout the year. Mosaic earned $1 billion on revenues of $9.1 billion, both essentially flat when compared with 2013, but with significantly more positive trends exiting the year. We have built a business model that is both resilient to challenging market conditions and positioned to accelerate quickly as conditions improve. Our results for the quarter and the year corroborate both of these concepts.","Market conditions stabilized in the fourth quarter, but grain and oilseed prices remained relatively low. Demand for our products, on the other hand, was extremely strong. Our fourth quarter is typically a seasonally slow period for us, but our customers came to the market in force. We met the demand with excellent operational performance.","Our potash mines ran at 91% of capacity, higher than expected because of the strong demand and the Colonsay proving run I mentioned earlier. Going into the quarter, producer inventories were very low and despite running all out, we shipped rather than stored the vast majority of the potash tonnes we produced.","The phosphate story has also been good. Global demand for phosphates has been strong for some time, and the trend continued in the fourth quarter. In November, we announced and executed a phosphate production curtailment in response to high raw material costs. Ammonia prices softened and customers stepped in to purchase our products, and as a result, we were able to exit the fourth quarter without building high-cost inventory for the spring season. This is a good illustration of our market leadership in phosphates.","I'd now like to highlight some of the other progress we made during the quarter and the year. As I mentioned, we completed a successful Canpotex proving run at Colonsay, significantly exceeding targeted production. As a result, our peaking capacity increased by 700,000 tonnes, and our Canpotex entitlement is now 40.6% effective January 2015.","In total, our proving runs for Esterhazy and Colonsay added 1.7 million tonnes compared to the expected increase of 1.3 million tonnes, almost 30% higher. These exceptional results were delivered on budget and on time.","The CF acquisition and integration are, for all intents and purposes, complete, and we are generating better-than-expected financial and operational synergies from the additional facilities.","The ADM distribution acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay closed near the end of the year, and integration work is proceeding well. We are now a major player in South America with the capacity to distribute 6 million tonnes of product.","We continue to be on track for the first phase of our Esterhazy K3 project, which is expected to begin delivering tonnes in 2017. The board has approved the modification of the original scope to accelerate the second phase of K3 development. The accelerated construction plan will move up the time frame when we could execute the option to replace underground mining operations at K1 and K2 and, thus, entirely eliminate brine management costs. We'll discuss the Esterhazy expansion and the options it gives us in more detail at our Analyst Day next month.","We completed the divestitures of our Southern Cone operations, sold our Hersey mine and discontinued higher-cost MOP production at our Carlsbad mine. Those facilities were not meeting our return expectations and those moves are behind us. We're significantly ahead of plan in our expense savings initiatives with identified savings of $500 million to be realized over a 5-year period.","Rich Mack, our CFO, will cover the capital and balance sheet work we accomplished this year in more detail, but I would like to note that we reached our debt leverage target while returning more than $3.1 billion to shareholders.","And last but not least, the Ma'aden project continues to rise from the desert, and we've included a couple of recent photos of the facility in our slide presentation today.","2014 was a busy year for Mosaic, but we are not resting. As we move into this year, we're proceeding with the evaluation of a de-bottlenecking project at our Faustina, Louisiana, ammonia plant. Our MicroEssentials conversion at New Wales is well underway, and we are also building a sulfur smelter at our New Wales, Florida, plant in close proximity to other chemical plants so that we will be more self-sufficient in phosphate, raw material sourcing.","We believe the investments we're making will allow us to maintain our advantage as a low-cost producer. We accomplished all this work and all the normal course of business work while once again improving our safety performance. We set records in our key safety measures for the third consecutive year, which is a real source of pride for the Mosaic team.","This long list of accomplishments distinguishes Mosaic by our ability to execute on projects that will benefit our shareholders. Mosaic is indeed a much more powerful franchise at the end of 2014 than just a year ago. We're thrilled with our progress and we're excited about the future.","Before I talk about our outlook for this year, I'd like to ask Rich Mack to provide more detail on the quarter and our capital. Rich?","Richard L. Mack","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. To continue Jim's message, a quarter ago, we suggested that the weak market sentiment that was then pervasive across agriculture was overblown. The results we reported today demonstrate that markets are much more stable than some might think and that we can generate a lot of cash even when commodity markets are not moving upward.","This morning, I will provide a bit more color on our segment results, give some insight on our capital plan now that many of our strategic initiatives have been completed and lay out our new guidance for 2015.","In the Phosphates segment, our disciplined paid off. After curtailing some phosphate production during the fourth quarter, raw material cost declined and dealers stepped in. We avoided building high-cost inventory, which was the main objective of the curtailment, especially when we saw ammonia and sulfur prices moving opposite of ag commodity prices. Our margins in this segment were higher than expected as a result of both lower mine rock costs and a $10 million pricing adjustment on purchased rock from Miski Mayo which is not expected to recur in the first quarter.","In the Potash segment, margins improved dramatically due to our high operating rates and our aggressive cost reduction program. We delivered record production and delivered near-record-low MOP cash costs of $91 per tonne, which includes brine management expenses of $17 per tonne.","I'd like to reinforce Jim's message regarding our potash expansions. They are proceeding very well. We have successfully executed Canpotex proving runs at Colonsay and Esterhazy K2, and the massive K3 project remains on schedule and on budget. These expansions are good examples of our prudent capital stewardship, which is underpinned by rigorous planning and solid execution. Like our other major investments, the potash projects have outperformed our initial expectations.","Transitioning to capital as we move into 2015. Our overall philosophy on capital management has not changed in any meaningful way. Our priorities, in order, are: to maintain our assets as well as our dividend policy; to invest in growth on organic projects and strategic opportunities that have attractive risk-adjusted returns; and finally, to return cash in excess of our stated liquidity buffer to shareholders.","I am happy to say that we delivered on all 4 fronts in 2014, which we believe is a distinguishing characteristic for Mosaic. The transformation of Mosaic's balance sheet in the past 13 months has been remarkable, and I would especially highlight our shareholder distributions. Since our restrictions on share repurchases expired in November 2013, we have repurchased $2.8 billion of stock. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $259 million of common stock, a clear sign that we find our stock to be a compelling buying opportunity right now. Of course, we also maintained our $1-per-share annual dividend. We are committed to maintaining our balance sheet targets, and our excess cash balance is estimated to be around $500 million once we complete our current share repurchase authorization.","While 2014 was a very active year, we will continue to execute against this philosophy in 2015 and beyond, and I'll have more information and updates on our capital plans at our Analyst Day next month.","Before I move on to guidance, let me provide an update on our upcoming segment reporting changes. With the acquisition of ADM's distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay, we intend to manage and report a new international distribution segment. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, we will report 4 segments: Phosphates, Potash, International Distribution and Corporate, with the Phosphates segment splitting out manufacturing from international distribution and a separate Corporate segment containing our legacy Argentinian and Chilean businesses, as well as mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. The objective of creating a new segment is to increase transparency and improve peer benchmarking and business modeling. Note that we plan to make historical financials available in early March and we will provide additional guidance at that time.","Now let's move onto our guidance for the first quarter and 2015 under our current reporting structure. In Phosphates, we expect margins to be in the mid-teens as a result of higher expected realized phosphate rock costs, with operating rates expected to be in the 80% to 85% range. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.8 million to 3.1 million tonnes for the first quarter. This compares to 2.7 million tonnes in last year's period. We expect to see the full benefit of tonnes shipped to the former ADM distribution business in 2015. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $440 to $465 per tonne during the first quarter.","In Potash, we anticipate that our mines will operate at high rates to meet global demand. Our operating rate is expected to be in the range of 85% to 90%. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes during the first quarter compared with actual volumes of 2.4 million tonnes in the same period last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $270 to $295 per tonne with a marginally higher mix of standard-grade international shipments and with limited upside given North American shipment constraints and inventory availability.","The gross margin rate for the Potash segment is expected to be in the upper 30% range. For the full year, we expect Canadian Resource Taxes and Royalties to be in a range of $215 million to $275 million. Our guidance for full year brine management expenses is $180 million to $200 million.","We expect SG&A for the year to be in the range of $360 million to $380 million, which includes the SG&A inherited from our recent acquisitions that will be more than offset by the benefits from our expense reduction initiatives. For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, in the low to mid-20% range. Our tax rate for 2014 was higher due to our decision to repatriate cash from Esterhazy, which was used for our investment activity and to return capital to shareholders.","We expect capital expenditures and equity investments for 2015 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.","And finally, we are adding 2 new data points to our annual guidance. For 2015, we expect annual phosphate sales volumes, including international distribution volumes, to be in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million tonnes and potash sales volumes to range from 8.5 million to 9 million tonnes.","At our Analyst Day in late March, we will provide a longer-term outlook for our business, including capital expenditures and investments. The event will be held at Streamsong Resort in Florida and will be webcast. I would encourage you to participate. It's a pretty good place to be, especially at the end of March.","With that, I will turn the call back now to Jim for his closing thoughts.","James T. Prokopanko","Thank you, Rich. This was a strong quarter for Mosaic and it gave us solid momentum as we moved out of a challenging 2014. All indications point to continuing strength in global demand for potash and phosphates through the North American spring. That is not to say that the outlook for agriculture markets are certain. The conditions that were creating weak sentiment last fall still exist. Two consecutive record global harvests have taken a bite out of grain and oilseed prices, and another record crop in 2015 would probably cause more pain for the world's farmers. As always, weather and commodity cycles will affect agriculture and Mosaic.","Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the negative sentiment toward our industry has been overblown because farmers will farm, and when they do, they will nourish their crops, and because those consecutive record crops removed record amounts of nutrients from the soil, nutrients that must be replaced. Mosaic is ideally situated to generate strong returns over the coming decades. We've made bold investments for growth. We've reduced our costs, and we'll reduce them even more in the future. We've built an efficient balance sheet and generated cash to return to our shareholders. We have the scale, the talent, the assets and the financial resources to lead this market in the years ahead.","Now we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson, BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Two questions. First question on Q1 potash, the guide, could you break that down on volumes between North America and international? And could you comment on whether the delayed China contract is holding back volumes in other offshore markets?","James T. Prokopanko","Joel, Jim Prokopanko here. Welcome to the call. I should've said something at the beginning of the call. I'll just do that now. We're doing this -- hosting this call from Phoenix, Arizona. We're attending the TFI winter meeting, so we're in a room that isn't as sound secure as we normally seem -- have been, so you might hear some noise and a little racket in the back, and so we apologize for that. But Joel, 2 questions that you asked. You asked about the China contract and impacts on demand in other markets, and the question about potash. I'll take the first one about the Canpotex contract, and then I'll turn it over to Rich Mack to talk about the timing of the sales. The China contract is -- a lot of people are waiting for it. We're quite patient about it here at Mosaic. We expect something could happen in the first quarter. With respect to China, we don't have a need to get something in the book right now. We're completely booked on shipments for the Q1 quarter. We just don't have any capacity to ship if we wanted to. So there's no rush from our point of view on getting that contract done. People are looking at it as a reference marker, but people are continuing to buy, our product's being shipped into China and we're seeing some signs of rising prices in other Southeast Asian -- or Asian markets. So it's not brought the market to a halt by any means and it'll get all sorted out in due time, and we expect it'll be good volumes and with -- and we're sticking to our guns on the increase that we're looking for with the Chinese. So just stay tuned. Rich, will you talk of the timing of the sale for potash?","Richard L. Mack","Sure, Jim. Joel, in the fourth quarter, just for a reference point, the North American split for potash sales was 42%; and international was roughly in the low 50%, call it, 53-ish percent range. I think as we go into Q1, as we noted in our remarks, you're going to see that international component up slightly from those Q4 numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess, maybe just a question for you, Rich, first. If I heard your numbers correctly on the call, it sounds like, there's 400 -- there's -- actually, you know what? I take that back. Jim, can I just ask you, you said that you're sold out for 1Q in potash, but then you've got a range of 2 million to 2.3 million tonnes of potash for the quarter. So what's going to delineate that 2 million to 2.3 million if you're sold out?","James T. Prokopanko","Vincent, glad to have you on the call. I hope you're well. We're sold out of Q1 production. We've got everything that we're producing fully committed and sold going in with low inventories. We do have more that we'll sell, but we are just completely committed on the production we have. Rich -- Rick McLellan wants to add a comment about that.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes. I think, with anything, Vincent, there's a range for -- it -- because it's still -- we may have it sold, but it's around execution. So there's -- we have rail risks, we have weather risks. And so that's what the range reflects. We're very well sold into this marketplace and continue to execute very well, but there always is risk in execution.","James T. Prokopanko","Okay. Second question was to -- you didn't have a question for Rich? That was it? Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A couple of questions on the domestic potash market. What impact does the Vanscoy restart and expansion have on your domestic volumes? And how have you factored that into your volume guidance for the year? And then, as Mike Rahm's pointed out, freight rates are down significantly. Vancouver to China's down $10 since November, we're seeing declines in some of your phosphate rates as well. So are you assuming that you could hang on to those lower freight rates and get higher net backs in both P&K?","James T. Prokopanko","Don, good to hear from you. I'll take that first question, just talk to the -- your question about Vanscoy, and my colleagues will answer your second freight question. Vanscoy, reports that we hear, it's starting. They're working on it, they're starting to bring it up. I'm not sure at what pace they will bring that up, but we're, at this point, not anticipating any kind of disruptions in the marketplace, certainly not in the first half and given the low inventories that producers have in Canada. With that said, North America is a very competitive market. By the second half, we may find that some of the additional Agrium tonnes are not required, but our practice, I'm just speaking for Mosaic, has been to produce to demand. We'll continue to practice that. We do not see material changes coming on in -- with respect to market shares in North America and the market will find an equilibrium. The -- some changes -- and I'll just add that we're seeing some importers attempting to bring product into North America this spring. That has not been disruptive, as far as what we can see. We have one traditional import supplier that's had a flooded mine. I expect the other Eastern European supplier might fill those shoes and -- if they do. So we're seeing it a -- being a very tight North American market. And as I said, production is fully committed in the first quarter and we expect a strong second quarter, so we just don't -- we don't see excess capacity in the potash market. The second question was about transportation, Don. And Rick, do you want to answer that? Rick McLellan, our commercial leader.","Richard N. McLellan","Don, Mike did do a good job of outlining just how low the Baltic Index is right now, plus the impact of low bunker prices. We're seeing it in freight rates right now, both on potash and phosphates. Our sense is that a portion of that, we will get to capture. And right now, it's just sorting itself out, but there are some significant changes have occurred. And Mike wants to add piece.","Michael Rahm","Oh. Don, yes, I think it boils down to the relative strength of supply and demand in terms of how that is split. And right now, it's much like raw material cost in phosphate in terms of who keeps that gain, and it's the relative strength of demand. And the markets right now look positive, and I think that bodes pretty well in terms of what producers can hang onto in terms of both lower raw material cost in the case of phosphate as well as lower freight rates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","Is there an opportunity to review your dividend policy in the near term? And how do you think about your yield versus your peers? I guess, Mosaic has come a long way in the last 2 or 3 years since you last raised your dividend.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks for that question, Ben. I'm going to ask Rich Mack, our CFO, to address that question.","Richard L. Mack","Thanks, Ben, and a relevant question. The way that we look at it, I think, is in connection with the overall capital management philosophy that we articulated in, for the first time, I think it was May of 2013, and since that time, I think it has served us well. Our current dividend yield is about 2%, which is in line with the S&P. And as you probably remember, we've said that we're going to grow the dividend as our business grows and since that time, of course, we've acquired CF Industries. We just closed on ADM. We've brought a lot of incremental potash capacity online. And so our business is growing. And in the future years ahead of us, we would expect that we would see commensurate growth in our EBITDA. So I think with Mosaic, what you could be thinking about is balance. It's not only dividends, but it's share repurchases. And at the current equity price that we were at during the greater part of 2014, we deployed about $2.8 billion in share repurchases because we felt as though our stock was undervalued, especially an under-appreciation, in my view, of our Phosphates business. And so what I would say is stay tuned. We do have the Analyst Day coming up next month at Streamsong, and we do intend to spend some additional time on capital management, which would include some commentary on dividends at that point.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks, Rich. I'm going to just add to that and just reinforce what the -- our capital philosophy has been. We've been, first of all, committed to maintaining our investment-grade ratings and our financial flexibility, and that comes with a sizable liquidity buffer; second, we will set aside the capital that's necessary to sustain our operating assets and maintain the dividends you're seeing; next, and you've seen it, we will invest in organic growth; and fourth, we pursue acquisitions, we've done a few of those. And joint ventures, we're doing that. And finally, the excess cash that we see, we return to shareholders. I got to reinforce, we've not been chintzy about, I think, the number we gave is, the last couple of years, we returned $3.1 billion in cash to shareholders. So stay tuned. We're not cabbaging away stockpiles of cash and we're going to be reasonable and prudent about the -- keeping the right kind of balance sheet. So thanks for that question, Ben.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson, Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. Given the rally in several sulfur and seeds abroad, can you talk a little more about your expectations for Tampa pricing over both the short and the long term?","James T. Prokopanko","I'll hand that right over to Joc O'Rourke, our COO. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke","Yes. Chris, the quarter 1 sulfur prices have been settled at $147, which was up $18 but not up substantially over last year. And that gives us price stability for the rest of this quarter and somewhat into the second quarter in terms of what goes into our products. So we've got short-term stability at about $30 below the China market, let's call it. Longer term, really, it's going to be about the U.S. refineries building up to the summer shipping period. So we'll have better supply once those U.S. refineries are running hard, which should be a moderator to any kind of demand increases. And then, the other thing worthy of mentioning in that is by building our sulfur melter, we're really giving ourselves the flexibility to participate in any market depending on what gives us the best value.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. I understand you probably don't want to front-run your Analyst Day, but could you just give us a little more insight or potential insight for de-bottlenecking of Faustina? And particularly, anything on volume potential and any preliminary thoughts on timeline?","James C. O'Rourke","So yes, we will discuss this in more detail in our Analyst Day, but as a sort of a quick estimate, it's probably a couple of years, and we're looking at in the range of 15% to 20% increase in production from that facility, so in the range of, let's call it, 80,000 to 100,000 incremental tonnes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","You talked about your potash taxes being between $215 million and $275 million for 2015, which is about a 30% difference. I was wondering, is that wide gap because it's hard to calculate what you're going to earn in potash or it's hard to calculate the taxes? And then secondly, I was hoping you might comment on why global phosphate prices appear to be rising.","James T. Prokopanko","Welcome to the call, Jeff. I'm going to have Rich address the question about the resource taxes on potash.","Richard L. Mack","Hey, Jeff, nice to hear from you. I think the answer is yes to both of your components. First, we do expect that we are going to have more profitability in our Potash business in 2015, and so that is one component. And probably, the bigger swing and maybe the reason for the wider range is what constitutes as deductible capital and whether or not that actually happens in 2015. So higher profits and overall lower deductible capital in 2015 is the reason why the projections for the CRT will be higher next year.","James T. Prokopanko","Your second question was about the phosphate prices going up. Really glad that's happened and glad you're noticing it. Mike's got a good analysis on why -- what we think is behind the increasing prices and why we have a solid foundation in that market.","Michael Rahm","Thanks, Jim, and Jeff, I think the story on phosphate, on one hand, it's a good demand story even absent one of the most important buyers, for all intents and purposes, namely India. And I think going forward, we would fully expect that India is going to be back in the market in a much bigger way this year and in the -- really, for the rest of this decade. But I think the other fact that's not fully appreciated is what's happened on the supply side. If you go down the list of major suppliers and take a look at some of the adjustments that have taken place over the last year or 2, there were some pretty dramatic changes. You can probably calculate 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes of supply that is no longer producing. So in the United States, the PotashCorp's Suwannee River plant has been shut down, about 400,000 tonnes of MAP equivalent there. The Misvos [ph] plant has shut down. Close to 600,000 tonnes there. And even around the globe, for example, the UralChem plant in Voskresensk, Russia, shut down last January because it couldn't negotiate a reasonable rock contract. The Tunisians are producing at half of their rate due to labor unrest, environmental issues. OCP is in a turnaround with many of their plants converting to wet rock as opposed to dry rock. And even in places like Brazil, if you look at their production numbers for the last year, their MAP production was off about 11%, equal to about 140,000 tonnes. Their SSP production down 6%, over 300,000 tonnes. So good demand coupled with the fact that -- there have been some supply issues, and a lot of attention has been placed on, geez, the Chinese export of 8 million tonnes of product last year. The fact is, I think, the market needed that given the demand-and-supply developments.","James T. Prokopanko","Jeff, I encourage you and your colleagues all to just pay closer attention to this phosphate market. It's a story we've been -- the drum we've been beating for a couple of years now. This is a market that's not fully understood, and by that, not fully appreciated. This is a good -- the phosphate is a good market. It's really transformed over the last 5, 6 years. We've seen the structure change. We've seen the alternative suppliers find higher costs. Demand has just been outstanding. We're going to be over -- well over, I think it's 65 million, 66 million tonnes of phosphate production, and it just is one that keeps on going and just hasn't had the spotlight. Well, I think phosphate's day has come, and investors have to be mindful of that and be mindful of who the largest producer of finished phosphates in the world is. And that's Mosaic, if you didn't know.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar, Citibank.","P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, two questions. First, in your December monthly Mosaic update, you talked about P&K volumes being down 20% to 25% for the fall, and then in January, you reported robust volumes. So I guess my first question is what changed between sort of December and January?","James T. Prokopanko","Well, welcome, P.J. I'll just give you a quick recap, then I'll let my colleagues, either Rick McLellan or Mike Rahm, add their perspective. And it's got our attention. How could we be off? And at the time that we looked at -- in that November period, early November, we're looking at the big crop coming off in North America. We saw commodity prices, grain, oilseed, wheat prices, weakening and we expected some lower -- frankly, quite a bit lower corn prices, and we were getting ready for a hard landing. The fact was that demand for grains and oilseeds picked up, the crop wasn't quite as big as we thought and we saw grain and oilseed prices stabilize. With that, it was clear that farmers were going to farm again. And even with lower prices, farmers aren't going to grow a smaller crop, they want to grow -- they need to grow a bigger crop. So we knew they'd be coming to the market. We weren't quite sure when. And when it became clear that grain and oilseed prices weren't going to fall off the table, dealers started coming back, farmers started to play their hand that they were going to buy product again, and here we go again. Rick, do you want to add something?","Richard N. McLellan","Yes. P.J., we talked in Market Mosaic, and I'll let Mike talk about the thought process there, but we talked about application being down. And we made the point that it -- a lot of it is weather-related, and farmers that were applying and did get the chance to apply, applied at normal rates. And the second piece that changed in December, and it came quite quickly, was the fact that farmers came in to retailers and bought prepaid fertilizer for this spring's application at much higher amounts than last year, so that forced the dealers to step in and buy. It's a real good situation, and you can't confuse shipments versus applications.","Michael Rahm","Yes, Rick, and I'd just add a couple of things. One, I think, weather. We -- the fall application season ended pretty early in November, and that's when we made the assessment that usage on the farm was probably off 20% to 25% from normal. And it was off, as Rick pointed out, not due to cutbacks in application rates necessarily, but simply that farmers couldn't spread as many acres as they wanted to because of weather. One other factor that I think came into play is that while November was a bad month, weather-wise, December turned out to be pretty mild. And I recall talking to several dealers at our ag college in early January that December was a very good month in terms of on-farm application in certain parts of the United States. So there's a pretty good tail onto the end of the season. And then the other factor, in terms of retailers, I think retailers saw that good tail application. And then, at the same time, you'll recall that prices bottomed in November and began to increase throughout December and into January, and then certainly, that provided dealers with some incentive to step up and position some product. And then throw on top of that all of the concerns that people have had about logistics and getting product in place. So people were -- sort of sensed the bottom was in, concerned about logistics, let's fill up, and so retail dealers began to fill at that time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","If we look at your phosphate sales volume guidance for 2015 of 14.5 million to 15 million tonnes, it seems to suggest a much more rapid growth rate in your own phosphate volumes relative to the global market volumes that you outline on Slide 5. And so I was wondering if you could clarify, does that 14.5 million to 15 million compare apples-to-apples with your, it looks like, 12.6 million tonnes in '14? And if so, perhaps you could elaborate on why you would expect to gain share, apparently, as the year progresses.","James T. Prokopanko","Hey, welcome to the call, Kevin. I'm going to turn it over to Rick McLellan, our commercial leader, to address that.","Richard N. McLellan","Kevin, I think the rate -- I think the range 14.5 million to 15 million really affects the -- it really shows 2 things: one is the full year impact of the CF production that we're going to sell, or the business that we got from CF; and the ADM sales volumes that will come in to 2015.","Richard L. Mack","And Kevin, this is Rich. In early March, when we post the historical financials for our Phosphates segment, we will have revised guidance for the new segments, so for the manufacturing part of the business and the international distribution component of the business. And nobody will be happier than me when we break those down into 2 separate reporting segments. So you'll get more information in a few weeks.","James T. Prokopanko","Kevin, to you and other listeners, we've been talking for the last 24 months at Mosaic about the various things we're doing to improve our business, to expand and grow our business. And we're starting to see the results of many of these actions over the last 24 months. The CF work, it's coming to market now. We're seeing the benefits. We're seeing the lower costs that we're -- and scale that, that brings with us. ADM, we've only owned that for about 6 weeks now. I was in Brazil last week. The market's a little late. As in North America, the farmers are a little slow to come to market, but it's going to work out very, very well for us. That access to 2 of the ports, to 2 of the inland distribution warehouses and the blend plants, we are extraordinarily well positioned. Perhaps the best in the country, the best phosphate, potash producer to get our products to those customers. So you're going to -- it's -- you're going to see the payback from this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly, CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Just 2 things. I'm curious how the road delays in Brazil affect your thoughts about ramping up new initiatives with those distribution assets. And second, I'm curious if the Carlsbad closing had a meaningful impact on the margins that we should be taking into account when we're thinking about the future quarters.","James T. Prokopanko","Mark, I'll take the first question about Brazil, having just literally got back, and I'll have Joc address the second question. The -- I think you said it's the rail delays? Or road...","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","The road delays. I mean, stuff that was supposed to be finished in December, and now they're saying it's not even close.","James T. Prokopanko","That's the road up to the Amazon, up to Santarem. That's -- the big chunk of it is completed, but there's pieces in the middle that aren't completed. Rainy season, it's tough to fully utilize that road. It's not really disrupting our efforts. We are working at -- we brought a vessel in to the Amazon and tried that out. So that road's going to get built. Logistics are a challenge in Brazil. You're absolutely right. That's where it was so important for us to make this investment with the ADM distribution business. It gives us additional port access, allows us the time with the additional warehouse capacity and space in-country in Mato Grosso and the northern states -- northern locations in the soybean-growing area. It gives us the opportunity to get product much closer to the producer than we previously had. The other part is just to comment about this season. Farmers are coming to the market a little later. We've had some economic issues in Brazil, the country has. The real's devalued, which in the end means soybean farmers are going to get more cash, more U.S. dollars for their soybeans. So farmers are just being, as in North America, a little more cautious. But that doesn't mean that they're not going to buy in style. So we're optimistic about a -- yet another good season ahead of us in Brazil. So it's all working out, and that's one thing about Brazil. As big as the challenges are, they somehow make that place work and we really enhanced our position with additional port and interior distribution. Joc, your turn.","James C. O'Rourke","Yes. So Carlsbad. Of course, the strategic reasoning behind Carlsbad is with the new production that we've brought on through K2 expansion and now Colonsay expansion, we can deliver to the U.S. markets more economically from our Canadian mines. And what that means overall is a margin improvement of probably in the range of $4 a tonne, all coming from the cost of delivery.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yonah Weisz, HSBX (sic) [ HSBC ].","Yonah Weisz - HSBC, Research Division","That's Yonah Weisz from HSBC. If I may ask a question on India demand, both for potash and for phosphate. And then, just one quick follow-up clarification. In India, we had an article out, I believe today, that's like saying that there could be actually, perhaps, 5 million tonnes of potash demand in the coming year. And I'm wondering if you could give some detailed color of how you see that market, both from a regulatory point of view and perhaps your point of view, as well as the actual demand on the ground, both, of course, for potash but also very significantly for phosphates. It seems that there's going to be strong demand in North America, then, I guess, the India, would even have a greater impact. And I'm wondering if you could give more detail on that. And then, the second quick clarification question, I think perhaps, Jim, did you say earlier on that potash shipments are still continuing to China? Or did I mishear that?","James T. Prokopanko","Yonah, sorry, the -- your line is just breaking up a bit. The second question about potash was -- can you repeat that please?","Yonah Weisz - HSBC, Research Division","Did I hear you possibly say that potash shipments are still continuing to China?","James T. Prokopanko","Okay, yes, I got you. I'll take that question and then Mike can address your question about Indian potash, phosphate demand. Yes, there is -- some of the suppliers in the world are providing continued shipments, although in a much reduced rate, even without a contract. So product is moving. Not -- nothing near what the Chinese need to China. So we had good shipments ourselves to China in the second half, and as I said, we do not have the tonnes to ship this quarter, but we have seen some other people move product into position unpriced, and that all yet has to be priced and that will happen, as it feels now, sometime after the Chinese New Year. But definitely, in this first quarter, the Chinese need to have product moved in earnest to China, certainly by sometime in April. Mike, over to you.","Michael Rahm","Sure. With respect to India -- and Yonah, good to talk with you again. I think there are several factors that make us think the stars and moons are lining up in India for very strong import demand. If you start at the farm, farm economics in India remain very good, given some of the increases and their minimum support prices, given the fact that subsidies are in place for fertilizer. We believe that the pipeline in India is at extremely low levels and there's a real need to replenish that. And when I talk about the pipeline, I'm referring primarily to the retail pipeline, the tens of thousands of shops that have a few bags of fertilizer in the back storage room. We think that's where the pipeline is pretty much bare. And then, a couple of other factors. The rupee has performed reasonably well given the chaos that's taken place in the rest of the world. And then, finally, I think if India's going to make any change in subsidy programs, this is a year where there is some potential for that. And when you look at the fact that oil prices have dropped in half and oil is the largest import in India, it gives them a few more degrees of freedom, I think, to modify their subsidy. So I think the bottom line is India needs P&K imports. Stars and moons are lined up. And we think, as the government is deliberating the 2015, '16 budget, that they will make import economics work simply because the product is needed. And then when we look out longer term, I think India, as everyone knows, they're simply -- have a tremendous nutrient imbalance. They need to use a lot for phosphate and potash over time. And we're of the view that Indian phosphate imports could double between now and the end of this decade, and they would still be just slightly above peak imports of 2010. So we're sort of banking on India in many ways, and we think that this is the year that India comes through.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Andrew Wong, RBC Capital.","Andrew D. Wong - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","First will be just, I want ask about the leverage. I mean it looks like you're comfortably within your target range, 1.5 to 2x debt to EBITDA. How can we expect to see that evolve over time? And are you comfortable with that and maintaining that level? Or could we see that maybe going up over time? Or maybe it'll come down as your EBITDA grows? And then, my second question would just be on the phosphate side of things. We've seen a few acquisitions, you have the Ma'aden project coming online. Are you satisfied with that phosphate footprint? Or are there more opportunities to grow there?","James T. Prokopanko","Welcome to the call and thanks for the interest, Andrew. I'm going to have Rich speak to the question of leverage.","Richard L. Mack","Andrew, I think what I would say is -- I don't want to steal our thunder for Analyst Day, but we will have more information on our balance sheet targets in late March. I do agree with you that the ratio will come down just through the fact that EBITDA growth is going to enhance, obviously, over the course of the next several years. And I think you have to take a look at our leverage ratios and our liquidity buffer in tandem and look at our overall capital management philosophy in terms of what we're going to do with excess cash and returning that to shareholders. So we look forward to having that conversation and providing some additional insight in late March, and we look forward to talking to you then.","James T. Prokopanko","Andrew, I'll take your question -- it's Jim here. I'll take your question about the phosphate and the degree to which we're satisfied with our current footprint. This is a market that we continue to be positive about. We're -- the market, as I said earlier, has changed. The structure of the industry has changed for the better and the barriers to entry are huge. We -- and so we feel very good about the market. If that's signaling that we're interested in growing in the phosphate market, you absolutely heard right. We'd like to be -- have a bigger footprint in the market. That's, in part, the reason we invested in the Ma'aden joint venture. Some years out, there could be a Ma'aden Phase 3, but we are going to continue to look for opportunities to be a bigger player in the -- in phosphate production. And ideally, to broaden our geographic presence, Latin America is an excellent -- is one of the fastest-growing agricultural regions in the world. If there was some way to get into the phosphate business in Latin America, we'd be interested in doing that. As you know in North America, we're pretty well limited on MAP and DAP production. However, we're limited because of the mining capacity and plant capacity, but what we've done is transform that commodity MAP, DAP business with our MicroEssentials products. We will, I see, get to a point that virtually 1\/2 of our approximate 10 million tonne annual production will be a MicroEssentials product. This has been a tremendous product for the -- first of all, for the customer. Real value, we have demand exceeding our supply capacity, which is behind our approximate $250 million in investing our MicroEssentials production capacity. And we've got a multiyear expansion plan for MicroEssentials that will get us, I think, by the end of the decade to close to 1\/2 of all our phosphates being our proprietary, highly-valued MicroEssentials products. So yes, I'm a booster of phosphates. It's been underappreciated these years. Its day is here, and we'd like to grow that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn, Barclays.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Research Division","One question tactical and another one more big picture, I guess. First, if you could clarify, I think you mentioned that North American potash shipments, you saw, at least early on in the year, limited by inventory availability. Could you talk a little bit about what the underlying causes of this are? Are logistic constraints something that's still holding back some distribution capacity here in the states? And then, second, Jim, you spoke well of how, I think, the company's preparing and executing as you wait for an improvement of market conditions, but where are we, in your opinion, on the process of kind of going through the cycle and seeing crop prices recover somewhat? I took note you mentioned how farmers are surprised and that they're -- they still came to market, they're planting heavily. So is this year another one of the crop stock-building? Or do you kind of see this year-over-year decline in global K&P demand indicative of a meaningful turn in supply and better crop prices sooner than later?","James T. Prokopanko","Matthew, a couple of thoughtful questions. I'm going to have Mike Rahm address the question about North American potash inventory availability, et cetera, and I'll touch on the -- where we believe we're in the ag cycle. Mike?","Michael Rahm","Well, I think in the case of potash -- and then, Rick, you certainly can comment, but we've seen a fair amount of inventory move from producers downstream into the channel. If you follow the IPNI statistics, just a tremendous drop, about a 1.7 million tonne drop in producer-held potash inventories in North America. And then, I think that has moved into the system. And I don't think North American situation is unique. I think most producers around the globe have shipped very hard into the system, and certainly, the shipment numbers reflect that. You've probably seen our estimate of over 61 million tonnes, and that's probably at the low end of the range of some of the numbers that you've seen here recently. So I think the bottom line is there are inventories that have moved further downstream. And I think, in the case of where those are, we think China has a bit of inventory build. And in the U.S., I think retailers are in a much better position this year than a year ago. They've learned from some of the logistical problems and constraints. I think they see, probably, better-than-expected demand earlier in the year. So as you would expect at this point in time, I think the system is pretty well loaded for the spring season.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks, Mike. The question about -- it's a good one about where we are in the ag cycle. And if you want a place, I'd say it's somewhere in the trough of the cycle. We've gone through a couple of years where the world has grown boomer crops, bumper crops. We've seen world grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios build, and that's taken some of the edge off of the grain prices. That said, farmers still remain profitable. Farmers have had 5 great, great years to build their balance sheets, to build their farming enterprises. And where we go next from here is the next crop that we're going to be planting. We're seeing a Brazilian soybean crop that is okay, a long ways to go yet, some drought impacts. It's not as big as we thought it is. We have a U.S. crop that, by the feel, by looking out my windows when I'm in Minneapolis, it looks like it's going to be an early season, much of the -- at least the Midwest, Boston, New York aside. They don't grow much corn. Other corn-growing areas don't have a lot of corn -- or a lot of snow, I should say, in the field. So it could be an early season. Farmers are going to get a lot of acres planted. And this supply of grain and oilseeds that we see come to market this next year is going to be telling. So that's the ag grain and oilseed side. The other side, rates to fertilizers is the supply side, and we've got a tightening market. We've lost some potash production to mine losses and mine closures. We have some new mines coming on stream. Phosphate, if anything, it's -- we're seeing less availability of phosphates, so it's a -- we feel good about the fundamentals of our crop nutrition industry. And I'm going to just have Mike add one comment here.","Michael Rahm","I'll just make a quick comment, Jim. I -- as you said, we've had tremendous crops with average yields well above trend. If you simply do the math and farm with spreadsheets, I think, as Vincent Andrews has coined, and just -- and take a look at, if next year, we get a trend yield worldwide and we get trend growth in demand, we're going to pull down inventories. And then, I think that goes back to what we've always said, that the long-term food story is still very much intact and that we're going to have to continue to increase planted area and continue to grow crops and achieve trend yields in order to meet demand. And I think that's the bottom line. We certainly haven't changed our view in terms of long-term positive outlook for global agriculture.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson, Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe 2 questions. First in potash, can you talk, Jim, about the outlook for production costs in 2015? Clearly, there -- you had the proving runs as you're running Colonsay very hard. Your Carlsbad's out of the system, that gives you a little bit of a cost tailwind, but expectations on unit costs on potash. And maybe second question, and it ties in a little bit, can you think about the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on your business? Clearly, there's some Canadian dollar tailwind in potash, but impact on your customers as you think about a stronger dollar impact on commodity prices and production costs for some of your customers in emerging markets.","James T. Prokopanko","Welcome, Adam. I'm going to have Joc O'Rourke speak to the production cost for potash in the coming year, and I'll have some comments about the currency question.","James C. O'Rourke","So Adam, I'm going to incorporate a little bit of what you've asked Jim in this as well. So our production costs last quarter were $91 cash per tonne, which included $17 of brine inflow cost. That really is a -- probably the best indicator right now of where we are with respect to our cost per tonne, although we expect some -- we expect the improvement as we reduce our -- some of our cost initiatives. But it really shows the leverage we've got now already. And if you look going forward, a lot of that is our cost savings. Not just the U.S. dollar, but the Canadian dollar is also giving us a pretty good tailwind. So we expect, if we can run hard, we're going to be in that kind of $74 a tonne plus the brine cost of, say, $17. So that's pretty good indication of where we'll be going forward.","James T. Prokopanko","All right. Adam, on the currency question. Stronger U.S. dollar, Joc made a good point that the Potash business, we have a dollar-denominated costs there, that Canadian dollar's come down relative to the U.S. dollar, but nothing like the ruble. The Belarusian and the Russian ruble are well, well off, we all know. So that has undoubtedly given the Russian and Belarusian producers some advantage, yet it's not -- their business isn't all run on rubles. They have euro and U.S.-denominated debt. They -- their suppliers are typically the miners and the equipment suppliers are typically other non-Russian companies. So they're paying for much part of their expenses in U.S. dollars. However, they're going to have labor costs that are lower. And with time, that is going to adjust. When you have these Maxi devaluations that go on, you see inflation come roaring into those geographies. So we think this is going to be, at most, a temporary advantage to those producing in devalued currency. On the farm side, many crops are denominated in U.S. dollars. So with this decline in the Brazilian real, I think we're down 30% on the real value, that is -- or close to 30%, that is resulting in close to a 30% increase in the U.S. dollar -- in the amount of U.S. dollars that a Brazilian farmer gets. Their expenses are going to be a little higher, but the margin they're going to make is going to be larger because of a stronger U.S. dollar. So net-net, with lower fuel costs, low interest rates, I don't think this is going to be damaging to our farmer customer by seeing the strong U.S. dollar.","With that, we're going to conclude the call. Thanks for that last question, Adam. And to wrap up, I'd like to reiterate our key messages.","First, our strategic moves have generated good earnings leverage, and our results, as I've said, are beginning to demonstrate the potential we promised and that we're building.","Second, global demand for our products have been very strong, and we expect the high demand to continue through 2015.","And finally, we've demonstrated some tremendous execution capability. You just cannot imagine how proud I am of the 9,000-plus colleagues that I have at The Mosaic Company. Many among the long list of moves that we've announced over these past 18 months are now fully operationalized. I know we get some comments that we are initiative-heavy. Well, many of those initiatives have been completed according to plan and delivering the results that we promised.","With that, I'll close the call with another invitation to attend our Analyst Day in March 30 at Streamsong in Florida.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company concludes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions. Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon?","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and year and our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will provide an update on our capital management and share insights into our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date, July 16, 2013, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I would like to turn it over to Jim.","James Prokopanko","Good morning. Welcome to our fiscal fourth quarter and full year earnings discussion. Mosaic delivered a great fourth quarter. Thanks in part to a very strong albeit late and compressed spring application season in North America, as well as record Canpotex shipments. Demand for our products remains strong in many parts of the world with the exception of India. This morning I will review the quarter and the fiscal year then Larry will provide guidance and an update on our capital spending. And then before we take your questions, I will discuss our outlook for the coming year.","We would like you to take away three key messages today. First, Mosaic continues to execute and deliver solid performance, quarter after quarter. Second, we have completed a great year of progress in fiscal 2013. And finally, Mosaic remains in excellent position to achieve our vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Let's start with the fiscal fourth quarter.","We reported operating earnings of $621 million on net sales of $2.7 billion. Both down compared with a year ago due to lower prices for potash and phosphates. The potash business unit contributed $445 million of operating earnings and the phosphates business unit contributed $198 million. In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.14, compared with $1.19 a year ago, an outstanding outcome in light of external factors.","We generated $855 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and we continue to maintain a strong cash position with $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Those numbers don\u2019t tell the full story. It was a tough spring planting season for farmers here in North America. Warm weather came very late and just six months after drought battered the 2012 crop, the spring of 2013 brought [thrashing] rains to most of the Corn Belt. Some of the same fields that our ploughed under for lack of rain last year were puddled and too wet for planting this year.","The Mississippi River, once so dry that navigation nearly came to a halt, was again difficult to navigate this time because of flooding. Despite the logistical challenges, Mosaic's excellent execution allowed us to have product where it was needed to be for a very compressed and late application season in North America. In fact, we sold 2.6 million tons of potash, a record quarter for Mosaic. And 2.9 million tons of phosphates with a big finish in the last two weeks of May.","Shipments were also strong outside North America. We delivered record shipments to Brazil. We have reached an agreement on phosphate contracts with customers in India. And Canpotex had its best March through May period ever due to high volumes to China and Brazil as well as strong potash shipments to Southeast Asia. The strong demand led to high operating rates in our facilities. Our potash mines operated at 95% of capacity, while the phosphates operating rate was 85% of capacity.","As we have always said, markets determine prices and potash and phosphate prices were lackluster for two market driven reasons. First, India continues to use significantly less potash than it has in recent history, offsetting demand growth elsewhere. As a result of the nation's unbalanced subsidy program, Indian agricultural soil is suffering and at some point the subsidies will need to change to avoid increasing pressure on the food supply. India will come back, we are just not certain when.","Second, additional supply is expected to come on the market with China and Saudi Arabia providing some new phosphate tons, and potash expansions coming online in Canada and Russia. We expect this softness which is exacerbated by the weak Indian rupee to continue over the near term. We have often said that volumes increase first followed by prices, and we expect that trend to continue. We have experienced two years without volume growth until now, volume is growing again. That demand growth will absorb supply and at some point prices will follow.","That said, North America upcountry prices held up well during the quarter, in part because of the logistical challenges posed by the weather. We were able to overcome those challenges with our final price deferred arrangements with some customers. These arrangements allow customers to fill their bins early and then price this inventory closer to when the product is sold. Mosaic and our customers jointly capture value at the point of retail sale, which has created significant goodwill and customer loyalty. It also enables us to maintain our production at an efficient and steady rate because it can move product to retailers before their customers are demanding it.","Beyond our excellent fourth quarter performance, the longer term outlook remains positive. Farmers still have strong incentive to maximize yield. And to maximize yield, they need fertilizer. Grain and oil seed prices have declined in anticipation of a big crop, which would be a welcome development for global food security. But prices remain high enough to deliver good farm profits, especially given the affordability of crop nutrition and other inputs. And let\u2019s not forget that farmers balance sheets and cash flows remain exceptionally strong as a result of many years of compelling economics.","Farmers can make a good living even if corn prices drift down to $4.50 or even $4 per bushel, especially if they\u2019re wringing more bushels out of each acre. Revenue per acre matters to farmers and there are a lot of ways to generate a profitable $900 of revenue per acre. So as farmers push for better yields, Mosaic can in turn generate strong returns even with lower grain and oil seed prices. One further note on grain and oil seed prices. We do not expect prices to suffer dramatically. Just as $7 corn did strong by destroying demand last year, we expect lower prices to unleash significant pent up demand for grain and oil seed this year, which should raise the floor under prices.","So to summarize our fiscal fourth quarter. Mosaic once again delivered on its promises and expectations. We executed well, mitigating the impact of extraordinary circumstances which enabled us to produce results that were in line with our guidance. I am very proud of what our team accomplished. We manage the company for long term success and our consistent quarterly performance is evidence of this focus.","Now, I will step back and talk about our full year. We made great progress throughout our fiscal year. Despite a tumultuous period marked by wild weather swings, shifting government policies and significant volatility in agricultural commodity prices, Mosaic took big steps forward while generating steady, solid results. I\u2019d like to recount some highlights. Our first priority is the safety of our employees. I\u2019m proud to report that we set another record for safety performance in 2013, which is a reflection of our operational excellence. We achieved a 6% improvement in our key safety measures and that comes on the heels of record performance in 2012. We made good progress on our Potash expansion projects, which remained on budget and on time. In Potash, we started to see the economic benefit of the tolling agreement reversion, which increased our allocation of Canpotex by 6 percentage points.","The Saudi joint venture is proceeding well. The next step is the signing of a shareholders agreement. When production begins likely in late 2016, the project will be an important new source of low cost phosphate fertilizer for us. We extended our market leadership in innovative, yield enhancing crop nutrition products. Mosaic\u2019s MicroEssentials phosphate product continued to gain market share in North America, Brazil and elsewhere. In fact, shipments were up 28% year over year. We plan to increase our production capacity to meet the strong demand for MicroEssentials.","In Florida, our South Fort Meade mine returned to full productivity, helping us generate phosphate rocks at lower cost. We received the Army Corps of Engineers Area-wide Environmental Impact Study regarding our phosphate acreage in Central Florida. We believe the AEIS report is a positive stepping stone as we work towards new mine permits.","Finally, we established and communicated explicit philosophies for capital management as part of our strategy to deliver strong shareholder value. That\u2019s quite a year and we accomplished all these things while generating $1.9 billion in cash from operations, $2.2 billion in operating earnings and $10 billion in net sales.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Larry. After he provides further discussion of our capital plans and our guidance, I will conclude with a walk of the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Larry?","Lawrence Stranghoener","Thanks Jim and good morning. We\u2019ve talked to you frequently in recent months about our capital philosophy, so rather than reiterate all that information, I\u2019ll provide a couple of relevant updates. First, we have had discussions regarding the Class A shares held by the Margaret A. Cargill Trust and Cargill family members. As we announced in a news release on June 25, Cargill Incorporated has elected not to allow the amendment of agreements that would have permitted accelerated share repurchases, and the trusts have elected to forego their right to demand a secondary equity offering at this time. It is our intention to pursue share repurchases or repurchases combined with the secondary offering, after November 26 of this year when we are no longer governed by split off related restrictions.","We continue to target mid-2014 to hit our stated balance sheet objectives, which include an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times and a liquidity buffer of $2.25 billion. Second, we are planning to access the debt markets when conditions are right. It is reasonable to expect the bond offering during the second half of 2013 to take advantage of historically attractive debt market conditions.","Now I will turn to guidance. We are delighted this is the last time we will be reporting under the May 31 fiscal year-end. As I am sure you are aware, we will change our fiscal year-end to December 31, and are currently in a 7-month stub period. Beginning with this call, we will provide quarterly and annual guidance on a calendar basis so the quarterly guidance I will go through now is intended to cover July through September of this year.","One final note on our fiscal year change. We intend to release our historical financial results recast on a calendar basis in September when we will provide results for calendar quarters going back to the first quarter of 2012. Our price and volume guidance reflects Jim's comments. This has been a year of volume recovery with prices impacted by a number of factors including the Indian rupee's weakness, contract negotiations with China, and generally cautious customer behavior. We expect strong volumes to continue and as Jim said, we expect prices to follow when these market issues are resolved.","For the third quarter of calendar 2013, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.8 to 2.1 million tons compared with actual volumes of 1.8 million tons in the same period of last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $330 to $360 per ton. The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the mid to high 30% range. Our upgrading rate in potash during the third calendar quarter is expected to be below 75%, which is lower than the last quarter due to planned seasonal maintenance turnarounds and a curtailment of production at our Colonsay mine. We may also curtail at other mines if required to match our production volumes to market demand for our products.","Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the quarter, and Canadian resource taxes and royalties will be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.9 million to 3.3 million tons for the third calendar quarter compared to 2.9 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $465 per ton. Mosaic's phosphates operating rate is expected to be in the mid 80% range during the third calendar quarter.","I would like to draw particular attention to our phosphates gross margin rate guidance. We expect the gross margin rate to be above flat with the quarter we reported today. We expect the decline in prices to be offset by lower raw material cost, though we do have some higher cost inventory to work through. The phosphate margin is one element of our guidance that seems to have been frequently misinterpreted, but I would note that we have been very consistent. Our reported gross margin rates have consistently fallen within our guidance range.","Also for the third quarter, we estimate SG&A expenses will be approximately $95 million to $105 million. For the seven months stub period, we estimate an effective tax rate continuing in the mid-20% range and capital expenditures and investments in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please note that our investment in the Saudi joint venture is not included in the capital expenditure line on the cash flow statement.","Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James Prokopanko","Thanks Larry. The outlook is promising for Mosaic. Internationally, we expect continuing strong shipments of both Potash and phosphate to Brazil, and we are optimistic about shipments to China. While a good monsoon season is likely to lead to a better than average crop in India, the nation will ultimately be healthier, more productive soils. When the government balances the subsidy program again, demand for our products in India should be quite strong. After all, the Indian population is growing by 18 million people per year, which obviously increases demand for agricultural inputs and foodstuffs.","Strong farm economics and ever increasing demand for grain and oil seeds underpin our expectations of robust demand for our products in the years to come. The long run of good farm economics is leading farmers around the globe to invest in higher yields and plant more acres. These developments are all very good for Mosaic\u2019s future. All soil needs nutrients.","As our guidance makes clear, we do not expect a significant recovery in potash and phosphate prices in the near term. Over the medium and longer term, we ultimately believe that economics will rule. The new supply of both nutrients that is coming to market now is likely to dampen prices and lower prices will lead to less future supply expansion. We have already seen a number of announcements deferring or canceling projects. New supply will continue to come in stair step fashion, resulting in short term periods of imbalance which we are seeing today. We are confident that over the next year or two, demand growth will ultimately absorb the new supply.","At Mosaic, we expect to capitalize on the strong, long term opportunity by executing our strategy and seeking new ways to roll. I\u2019d like to provide a few highlights of our future. We are taking a number of actions to grow both our business and our earnings. Our new potash capacity is expected to lead to volume growth and stronger cash flows. Our Saudi joint venture will enable us to expand our production of low cost phosphate and supply to important growing agricultural markets. And we\u2019ll continue to look for value adding business development opportunities, both joint ventures and acquisitions.","In Brazil, where the future of agriculture is bright, we\u2019re making a significant new investment to expand our presence. Over the next five years, we intend to spend approximately $300 million on a number of projects to build, expand or acquire facilities. We will provide more details about our Brazil strategy this fall at our October 7 Analyst Day in New York. We also intend to extend our innovation lead. We expect to continue to grow our market share for our higher margin premium products and we will continue to find better, cheaper, more sustainable ways to operate.","Finally, we are constantly striving to deliver strong shareholder value. We are committed to improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and returning capital to investors. We\u2019re maintaining our goal of achieving our balance sheet objectives by mid-2014. These initiatives, along with our consistently excellent execution foretell a promising future for Mosaic. That\u2019s good for us. It\u2019s good for investors and it\u2019s good for the world.","The globe\u2019s population is rising and the growth is concentrated in the developing nations. You know the numbers by now. 75 million more people to feed each year, 2 billion more by 2050, nearly 1 billion more in Africa alone. And as those developing economies make progress, their citizens will demand more nutritious food which in turn requires even greater agricultural production. As an example, the Guardian recently reported that China\u2019s meat consumption has increased fourfold in just 20 years. That\u2019s 1 billion people multiplying their meat consumption by four in two decades, thanks mostly to China\u2019s rising economic fortunes. We can expect that China will continue this trend and that other nations will make a similar leap as their prosperity improves.","Is agriculture up to an enormous challenge? We believe it is, and we know it's going to require a lot of phosphate and potash. Croup nutrition is responsible for up to 60% of croup yields and the world clearly needs higher yields. Mosaic is in a great position to help the world's farmers meet the challenge and help the world grow the food it needs.","Now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","You mentioned in your commentary that you were benefitting from lower sulfur and rock costs offsetting weaker phosphate product prices, but you didn\u2019t mention ammonia. Can you just kindly run through the input costs and give some color on your expectations for the back calendar year and also what further benefits we are set to see from a cost perspective.","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Chris. Thanks for the question. You are right to observe that and make the connection over the important distinction between phosphate pricing and gross margins. We are in fact seeing a reduction in the cost components to phosphate production. And I am going to ask our Chief Operating Officer, Joc O'Rourke, to talk about some of the specifics in the dynamics he is seeing in those markets. Joc?","James O'Rourke","Yes, thanks Chris. Yes, we are certainly seeing lower prices in all of our raw materials. Ammonia has come down about 20%, sulfur is down significantly and moving down as we speak, and rock costs are also moving down. However, the one thing we need to point out is there is about a quarter lag between when we see the change in prices and when it meets cost to goods sold. So what we expect to see is, despite the lowering price we should see our margins stay relatively flat because of the prices of raw materials.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Could you give an update on the ammonia plant and whether you are going to go forward with that or not?","James Prokopanko","Sure Vincent, and good day. It's a project we continue to study and review as fast as we do our work. We continue to see both additions to the list of plants that maybe built as well as deletions. I am going o ask Larry Stranghoener, our CFO, to speak to where we are at on that project.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Hi, Vincent. Good morning. We are in the final stages of our analysis. We are going through a very detailed front-end engineering program to make sure that when we make a decision we will be fully informed. As Jim alluded to, we are closely watching trends in supply and demand for ammonia longer term, supply and demand for natural gas longer term. We are making sure we understand all the cost of this project before we make a final decision. So look for an announcement before the end of this calendar year for sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","I was hoping to get some color on the potash pricing guidance for the calendar third quarter. And you have got a pretty noticeable decline relative to what you just reported for the fiscal fourth quarter. I am trying to just bridge that a little bit by region and mix of shipments, if at all possible. Any color there would be helpful.","James Prokopanko","Hello, Adam. I will give you just an opening statement and then Rick McLellan will give you some of the specifics by market and by grade. As we have seen a weakening, a slackening in demand, first of all in potash. And this has all been caught up in what's happened in general crop nutrition market and P&K. We have seen a strong decline in urea pricing which has gotten the attention of dealers and farmers. We have seen the phosphate price cost components go down as well as the price of phosphates go down. Again, that has the attention of both farmers and dealers and potash is getting caught up in that. We have seen a slackening of demand and people just have become much more cautious about taking inventory price risk, putting product into position ahead of a season. And so they are just waiting to see when the bottom comes in.","I believe we are very near the bottom, certainly on the potash market and I think this is great value at these prices certainly relative to the crop prices. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Richard McLellan to give you some of the details by market.","Richard McLellan","Good morning Adam. Jim did a good job of framing up the situation, but I think there\u2019s a couple of things as far as markets go that you need to take into account when you\u2019re looking at our guidance. First, we published down our price in North America warehouses by about $20 to $25 a ton last week. That has to be taken into account for net bags into this our first calendar year quarter. The second is that we\u2019ve seen pressure in markets around the world, whether it be Brazil where we\u2019ve seen prices come off higher levels to getting down closer to $400 a ton for import levels and the same thing into [slot] markets, Malaysia and Indonesia we\u2019ve seen price pressure. So this reflects what\u2019s going on in the market. The other piece is that during -- its\u2019 a bit of mix as well as we\u2019ll see a little more standard and a little less granular in our forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan","You talked about outlays for the Ma'aden II joint venture in the stub period of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Is that an outlay that will come -- or how will you finance that particular outlay?","Lawrence Stranghoener","Jeff, it\u2019s Larry. Good morning. Just to clarify, what we said is that in the stub period we expect to have capital expenditures plus investments totaling $900 million to $1.1 billion and the great bulk of that would be typical ongoing capital expenditures in our core business. We have said that over the next few years we will invest up to $1 billion in the Ma'aden joint venture, with the rest of the project financed through project financing means, which is coming along quite well. So it\u2019s an important clarification. I think in the stub period we\u2019ll probably be spending roughly $200 million or so for Ma'aden.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J Juvekar with Citibank. Your line is open.","P.J Juvekar - Citibank","Farmers in India want to get all their nitrogen through subsidized urea rather than unsubsidized DAP. So do you think that will impact DAP demand this year? And just on the flipside, what do you see for exports out of China for DAP? Thank you.","James Prokopanko","Good morning, P.J. I will discuss the first question about India and then have Mike Rahm talk about the China question. You\u2019re absolutely right. This has been a very market distorting subsidy program that the Indian government has in place. You\u2019re seeing -- we\u2019ve seen prices on both DAP and on potash nearly triple over the last 18, 24 months, while there has just been a couple of rupees increase in the price of urea. So the Indian farmers have looked at that and their thinking is, flawed as it may be, but their thinking is, we\u2019ll just put on twice as much urea and reduce our potash and phosphate. This will catch up to them. This is not good for the crop production, the balance of nutrition that those plants need and it\u2019s not good for the environment.","We have little doubt that that will be adjusted in the coming months. The time frame on that will not likely be before the May, I think it\u2019s May 2014 federal elections and national elections in India. The Indian government to make this right will have to increase or decrease I should say the subsidy paid for nitrogen fertilizers and that means the price of nitrogen fertilizer will go up for the Indian farmers and no official in India that\u2019s looking to be reelected is going to dare raise the price on urea which is domestically produced and a staple for the Indian farmer. So this is where we see things to be again slack in India for the next 10 or 12 months until the election is done, then agronomics will prevail and they will correct for that. Mike, would you speak to the question on China.","Mike Rahm","Sure. We have taken down our export number to about 6 million tons of DAP, MAP, TSP. And of that DAP will probably be about 4.5 million tons.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","In the past I think you put out a forecast for global potash shipments in a range of 55 million to 57 million tons for this year. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your expectations there and specifically address the volume expectations in India as well timing of a potash contract with China. Thanks.","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Kevin. I am going to turn that right over to Mike Rahm.","Mike Rahm","Good morning, Kevin. We have not changed our guidance range. We still maintain that global potash shipments, MLP shipments. We will fall in that 55 million to 57 million ton range. We have shaved our point estimate from sort of the upper half of that range to the lower half of the range. In terms of some of the adjustments we have taken Chinese shipments, total shipments down to about 11 million tons. We have taken a little bit out of India. Offsetting some of that decline are better shipments into other parts of the world such as Brazil and North America. I guess I will turn it over to Jim or Rick in terms of comments about Chinese second half negotiations.","Richard McLellan","Yeah, Mike, I will take it. It's Rick here. The last shipment on our first half contract to China left last week. So our commitments are met. If we look at what's going on in China right now, we have seen port inventories come down. Inventories in the country being used up and given where we are at, we would expect near the end of the third quarter, some sort of closure on a Q2 or a second half contract into China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Jim, you have been consistent about being happy with the way potash inventories are managed in North America and moving product close to the customer has been good for you. We have another producer who tells us that they think that\u2019s a relatively permanent shift in who is going to be carrying the working capital. But we have another producer who says that the first hint of pricing power is going to bring the dealers back to put that on their books. Where do you come out on that in the medium term?","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Mark. I think we are in a period for the near term, this situation we have now where product is position closer to the customer in the dealers facilities. And I don\u2019t see an immediate near-term change in the next one of two years unless we do see something materially change in the market place. This all started back in those heydays of 2007-2008 where the entire industry and particularly the farmer facing end of the supply chain got a real lesson in risk management. They understood that they were taking on risks that with (inaudible) and having a checkbook that they might not be able to write against. So they backed off. The North American supply, the producers, are very talented at getting product along with our partners in the transportation industry to customers.","So we have found this to be a, maybe not the way we would like to manage our working capital but to be effective in building customer loyalty, securing our distribution channels. It's tough to move product out once it's into a facility. And so we have adjusted. And this gives dealers some better tools to manage the significant risk they face and we are able to run our facilities at more of a flat line rate which helps us manage at a steady rate. It helps us manage our cost of production.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Just a couple of questions. One a follow up just on Rick's commentary, talking about prices in Brazil and Southeast Asia may move lower to $400 a ton. On the back on some of the summer fill pricing being a bit lower and state, could you talk about are you seeing prices for granular now in Brazil dropping $20 a ton? Are you talking about close to $400 a ton? And then my second question was, it seems like in May quarter phosphate blends and feed pricing was quite strong. Maybe talk about that.","Richard McLellan","Good morning Joel. I\u2019ll give a few clarifying points. One, we had a price (inaudible). We reestablished our price for fill in North America. In Brazil we\u2019ve seen prices slip from highs of $20 to $30 a ton and those highs were in the April, May period. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing a bit of price pressure around the world. And right now it\u2019s manageable and as Jim said earlier, we expect this reflects what the bottom is to the marketplace. And the second question was on blend and feed pricing. Feed pricing is on -- I\u2019ll start there, is on contract pricing for a quarter. And so the prices there were fixed at the start of the quarter. So it didn\u2019t reflect any kind of pricing pressure and it follows through. And blends are just a reflection of the products that we\u2019re putting together and the costs that we\u2019ve got them in, in our distribution businesses around the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","I was wondering if you guys could give a little bit more color on where you see your phosphate rock costs going forward. And how far are we in terms of the ramp up of Miski Mayo and the flow through in terms of P&L on that? Thanks.","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Michael. That\u2019s a good question for Joc O'Rourke to answer.","James O'Rourke","Hello Michael, Joc O'Rourke here. Phosphate rock costs, we are seeing -- South Fort Meade is fully up and running. So our home costs are now pretty much where they\u2019re supposed to be which is in the $35 range cash cost. In terms of purchase rock, the purchase rock has come down probably about 10%, but we believe that the sellers of -- main rock sellers around the world are going to be quite responsible and we don\u2019t see that coming down significantly from where it is today. And finally, your question on Miski Mayo, Miski Mayo is going through its ramp up efficiently. It\u2019s right on track, but we don\u2019t see the cost in terms of cost of goods sold. Those are third party earnings flow through as other earnings as opposed to as a cost item. So they reflect market cost in that. I\u2019m going to hand it over to Larry just to give a little more color.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Yeah. Michael, just a little more color. From a financial standpoint, the Miski Mayo venture is proving to be a success. We are starting to see a very substantial dividend income flowing from that joint venture which certainly should be seen in a holistic way as an offset to the price we pay for the rock from that line.","James Prokopanko","Michael, let me just add, this is -- my colleagues are being too modest here. This is just a great success story. What the operations mining team has been able to do getting South Fort Meade ramped right up and getting our costs down to $35 a ton, this is a wonderful story of execution. We are back to costs if I dare say and we are back at four or five years ago. This is really to the story of we\u2019re taking care of our costs, we\u2019re dealing with -- we\u2019re executing as we promised we are and this is a real success story.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carroll with UBS. Your line is open.","Bill Carroll - UBS","Can you share your thoughts on the longer-term impact of the major potash importers, namely Brazil, China, India, potentially pursuing uneconomic projects to secure supplies? And how might that change your plans to bring back the deferred tons from your expansion projects?","James Prokopanko","Good day, Bill. You hit it with the word uneconomic projects. We believe they are -- they were uneconomic at $450 and $500 and they certainly are uneconomic at $400. Now they may have some other reasons to pursue the uneconomic investment of their precious dollars. But I think the reality is setting in on them. We are seeing others defer projects. Brownfield projects are being deferred, ours included, let alone these Greenfield projects. I think they really have to step back and look at the economics. We are seeing some of the major miners who overreached on some of the other basic materials. And that applies with potash as well. And the same people continue to talk about it. I think they are going to still scratch around some of the fields that they have got access to. But I don\u2019t see any real material Greenfield projects being needed or economic until the next decade.","As far as our projects that we have deferred, well, they are going to remain in deferral phase until we see some of the costs for expansion come down, the cost of the capital investment. But the other piece of it is not only is there a diminished return in the potash market but the costs of these investments. These are mega projects. They are very high. And we have come to the realization and practical realization that it's time to take a deferral on these and see costs come down before and the potash prices go up before we bring those back on to our expansion program.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","Looking on your thoughts about the kind of demand level that the industry is really going to need to press prices back up meaningfully. And for 56 million tons or so now, and operational capacity for the whole industry is moving to I think arguably in the mid-70s by 2015. I mean by your numbers it's going to take about 4 or so years if we are going to 3%, to get around 85% use of capacity. Is that a realistic timeframe or do you see something that could shift nearer term?","James Prokopanko","Hello, Matthew. I am going to have Mike Rahm lead off with answering that question.","Mike Rahm","Good morning, Matthew. Yeah, we have looked at our long-term potash S&D. We have made some modifications to that based on some of the announced deferrals and cancellations. Right now we peg global MLP capacity in that 64 million to 65 million ton range. And based on our projected usage in the 55 million to 57 million ton range, you are looking at operating rates in the mid-80% range, 86% or so. Looking out to 2020, we are now putting expected capacity in the 81 million to 82 million ton range. We have knocked that down about 3 million tons. We had been around 84 million tons of the effective capacity. And our project demand in 2020 is around 70 million to 72 million tons. So that translates again into 85% to 87% operating rate more or less.","And given some of the changes, when we look at projected operating rates, we see them fairly steady between now and the end of the decade in that 86% to 87% range.","James Prokopanko","Matthew, I would just add that you are starting to see the industry reaction to the slack demand that we are having along with curtailments of brownfields, greater questions around the greenfields. Just the ongoing operating facilities that operated around the world, people are pulling back. These are getting to questionable economics on some of these projects, some of those higher up on the cost curve, and just as well leave it in the ground. So we are now seeing the resolve by producers to match the demand and to achieve economic return for their shareholders. This market will balance out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Two questions. One on the domestic potash market. Even when you adjust for grade, you are still getting a premium in the domestic market. But when your large customers will be expanding their mine and pushing out volumes they buy from you and others, I am just wondering what that will do that domestic premium as we get into that mine starting up in 2015. And then just a follow up for Larry on the Faustina project. I know there has been a number of cancellations of deferrals announced by nitrogen producers because of the, roughly 35%-40% escalation in capital costs. So you had talked originally of a $700 million project. Just wonder, if you did proceed with that, what the cost would be now.","James Prokopanko","Hello Don. Good to hear from you. You said one of our customers coming up in 2015? Does that mean you were referring to the Agrium Vanscoy project? Okay. I assume that\u2019s what you\u2019re referring to. Yes, North America has some new projects coming online. We have all three major North American producers have expansions under way. And some have started and completed proving runs, and some are about to come. We\u2019ve completed our K2 Esterhazy run. That product is about to -- that mine is in a position to do a proving run. We\u2019ll announce that once it\u2019s completed and once we consider the timing of pulling that off. It\u2019s a market that\u2019s going to balance. I think we\u2019re going to see growth in the international demand that\u2019s going to pull product offshore and I think you\u2019ll see producers in North America balance their production to what the demand is, where we talked about in this call the curtailment of -- indefinite curtailment at our Colonsay facility.","We've just completed some and had some extended turnarounds in our other facilities and it will balance. I'm not overwrought about there being too much product hitting the North American market. And the product that\u2019s in North America, it will first displace the imported product that has been coming to the country, coming into North America for the last two years. Maybe Mike can talk a bit about what we've seen by way of imports into North America. Sorry to put you on the spot there, Mike.","Michael Rahm","Imports have captured anywhere from about 7% to 10% of the North American market. And so there is room there to claw back some of the tonnage from imports.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Don, it\u2019s Larry. With respect to your follow-up question about the Faustina ammonia plant. Yes, as I said earlier, one of the things we're looking at intently is the long-term supply of and demand for ammonia. We're certainly watching all of the various projects that have been announced, wondering how many of those will actually go ahead. Ultimately it's our interest to have more merchant ammonia available. So that will certainly be a factor that enters into our final decision. With respect to cost of the project, you\u2019re right, costs are creeping up on these projects, any projects of this sort. I think we benefit from being one of the ones that are much farther along in our project planning than others. We have cited cost estimate in the $1 billion plus range for a new plant, to which would include all of the logistical infrastructure that would come with that. And I suspect when all is said and done, we'll end up at a cost somewhere around that $1 billion plus mark if and when we -- if we decide to go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financial. Your line is open.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","I\u2019ve got a follow-up question on operating rates. Mike, you talked about the fact that you think operating rates in the mid-80s for potash right now and yet we're seeing lower prices. So, one, what operating rate do you need in order to get pricing flexibility? And two, given 2% to 3% growth in the industry, could that be several years off if you need low-90s for the industry to get pricing flexibility?","Michael Rahm","Good morning, Mark. Yeah, we estimate as I said before that the global industry is running in the mid-80% range. That's 80% of effective capacity. So compared to the 2007, 2005 era where you were in the upper 90s, it is a significant change. That said, I think as Jim pointed out, we see the market basically in a pretty decent balance. and we think that when some of these of unusual events are behind us that this market is going to come into a pretty stable and decent equilibrium where a global operating rate of 85%, 87%, should be one that supports prices and margins at closer to historical levels.","James Prokopanko","Mark, just to put it in context the way I think I about it is, we have seen 2012, globally 2013, the pie hasn\u2019t been growing. It's pent up demand that\u2019s out there. It should be growing to produce the food the world needs. But the pie hasn\u2019t been growing. At the same time our appetites for a slice of the pie has increased with expansion. And it's -- I think just a transient situation. We are going to pass through this that the pie is going to start growing again. The extra capacity we have brought on is going to be eaten up and we will be back in the situation of good market demand. Grain prices still are good. Farm economics still are good. The demand is there for it. It will come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Neivert with Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Neivert - Cowen Securities","A couple of real quick questions. One, as Miski Mayo continues to ramp up, is the other rock that you buy going to ultimately get replaced with Miski Mayo rock or do you need that rock to get the right mix for the DAP? And the other thing is, in terms of Canpotex share which obviously jumped when you got the tolling arrangement back. What kind of time frame do you see it sort of reverting back toward either its old level or where do you see it going back to? You guys are expanding but your competitors are also expanding and that obviously has a lot to do with the share. Are we going to go up from here near term or down from here near term over the next couple of years, let's say?","James Prokopanko","Hello, Charles. Good couple of questions. I am going to ask Joc to answer the first one about Miski Mayo and I will come back to the Canpotex question.","James O'Rourke","So Charles, in terms of Miski Mayo, yes, we will purchase less rock on the open market because of the Miski Mayo expansion. However, we will continue for a couple of reasons to purchase some rock. One is for blending, to make our product more consistent. And the second is just to keep a finger in that marketplace and keep our relationship with our existing suppliers. So we will continue to buy but probably at a much lower rate.","James Prokopanko","Charles, to your question about Canpotex, we have received notice for the second half of the year that our share will come down from 43% down to 40% of the Canpotex share. Last year it went up. At the beginning of the year it went up with the reversion of about 1.2 million tons from one of our competitors, based on the tolling agreement that came back to Mosaic. We went up about 3%, now we have dropped 3%. Each producer in Canada has got various expansions underway. I mentioned we have got our Esterhazy K2 expansion complete now and ready for a proving run. So we will see gives, puts and takes on this Canpotex allocation. We do not run our capital expansion program based on increasing share of Canpotex. We run the program and we make our investments based on market demand for our potash products. So it's going to come and go. I expect this year there is going to be another change or two that you will see and just stay tuned. But I don\u2019t know that it's going to be particularly material for the balance of the year, how those 1% or 2% change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson with Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Bank","Quick question on MicroEssentials. Volume was up 28%. Can you give us a full update on how that market is doing, including both your supply growth and how demand is tracking? Number one. Number two, how meaningful is MicroEssentials to your bottom line? And then I guess most importantly, how should we think about pricing and margins of MicroEssentials in the context of the choppiness that we have seen with respect to DAP prices and feedstock costs of DAP?","James Prokopanko","Hello, Ben. I am going to turn that right over to Rick McLellan who is our commercial leader and champion of this great product.","Richard McLellan","Good morning, Ben. On MicroEssentials, I think Jim said it in his comments. We have seen volume up 28% year-over-year and we are growing quickly to the capacity that we have today for production. So we are looking at expanding our production. The market demand continues to grow. If we had more product today, we'd be able to ship it. And so we feel real good about that. Probably the more important thing to look at is that as we've been able to prove yield advantage to farmers, both our dealers and ourselves have been able to increase our margin capture. So in the last year, we've increased our margin capture as the producer about $15 to $18 a ton. That's significant in any market. As we\u2019ve moved into softer markets that spread has stayed. So the market pressure on a premium product seems to be less than it is on commodity products. We feel good about our position and our both production, sales and supply chain teams are just executing like we've never seen in getting this product into the right place at the right time.","Michael Rahm","Ben, let me just add. We have as one of our five strategic priorities innovation called out specifically. We're trying to \u2013 where we're working to build and effectively building on our industry-leading products. This is one of the first material new product innovations in phosphates in a long, long while and we are really in our view hitting the ball out of the park. Stay tuned for more of this in other products, but we are finding we\u2019ve got the muscles to do this task really, really well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yonah Weisz with HSBC. Your line is open.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC","A question and two clarifications if possible. With regard to phosphate markets, you talked about the last weeks of the quarter being very, very strong finish. Would you be able to talk about the dynamics of that strong finish, whether it would be in the U.S. or in South America? And two clarifications if possible. You mentioned earlier on that your contract with China for potash has finished. Have they taken the optional quantities or is that just the fixed original quantity contract? And second, there\u2019s been a lot of discussion on this call about long-term operating rates and long-term volumes for the potash industry. Are your calculations or your estimates including Jansen or not? Thank you.","James Prokopanko","Good day, Yonah. I'm going to have Rick speak to the market finish and the China and Michael will talk about the supply forecast regarding Jansen. The market\u2019s been -- I will just open by saying it was an extraordinary two weeks and a reminder why May 31 is not a great year for yearend of a fertilizer company. It was -- we were in the edge of our seats. We were certain it was going to be a good strong finish, but it fold in under the wire. Our sales organization, the supply chain logistics, they really did some -- worked some miracles here to supply the extraordinary North American demand that we have. Now, Rick will speak to what this might portend for the months ahead. Rick?","Richard McLellan","I think, Jim did a good job of framing what happened. I think the one thing we go back and just mention is because we moved product into place and had the opportunity to meet this in-season demand, t really helped us execute against the last two weeks. The time, place value of having inventory where it's needed can't be understated. As far as Canpotex and the Chinese, we had no optional tonnage in our first half contract. Mike?","Michael Rahm","With respect to the long-term capacity figures that I referred to earlier, we do now have Jansen in before 2020. We do have a couple of Greenfield projects. We have the K+S and the Uralkali projects coming in before the end of the century, but no other Greenfield.","James Prokopanko","Well ladies and gentlemen, we'll make that our last question. To conclude our call, I'd like to remind you of our key messages for today. First, Mosaic continues to execute and deliver consistently solid performance. Second, we made great progress during our fiscal 2013 year. And third, while current market conditions are challenging, our long-term outlook for Mosaic remains highly compelling. We are in excellent position to achieve our vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Thank you for joining this morning. We look forward to seeing you during our travels and our analyst day on October 7 in New York. Thank you very much and have a safe day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Mike Rahm, Vice President, Strategy and Market Analysis.","We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at MosaicCo.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results.

O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings discussion. This morning, I will talk about our results. Then Mike Rahm will provide insights on our market conditions we expect in 2017. Rich Mack will discuss our financial outlook, and I will have some concluding thoughts before we take your questions.","First, I would like to mention the leadership changes that are happening as a result of our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. Rick McLellan is now Senior Vice President for Brazil. He will lead our combined business there after the transaction closes, and he is now fully engaged in the integration planning. Corrine Ricard has stepped into Rick's previous role, Senior Vice President of Commercial. Corrine most recently led our HR function and before that, she spent many years in senior roles in our commercial organization. She knows our markets and our customers extremely well, and she will be a valuable addition to our commercial efforts.","Before I get into the results, I want to briefly touch on the dividend action. As we previewed in December and as you have seen in our news release, we announced a reduction in the targeted annual dividend to $0.60 per share effective with our next dividend declaration. This move reflects our commitment to our investors to maintain a strong financial position, in light of the risk that the pace of market improvements is more gradual than we expect.","Now, let's get on to our results. This was a good quarter for Mosaic, with very strong shipment volumes and rising market prices for our products. We have three key points for you today. First, we had an excellent quarter from an execution perspective. Second, we are confident that the bottom of the cycle is behind us, and that markets are improving, albeit slowly. And third, Mosaic has managed our business effectively and invested wisely. As a result, we are in excellent position to capitalize on better business conditions going forward.","We are working to maximize the opportunities the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition will provide, while maintaining costs and preserving capital so that we can create long-term shareholder value.","We are optimistic about 2017. And we are definitely feeling better now than we were at this point last year. There is no question that business conditions are improving, and our execution has allowed Mosaic to fully capitalize on the upswing.","I'd like to point out some of the highlights of the quarter and of the year. In our Potash business unit, our MOP production cash cost per tonne decreased substantially, with costs for the quarter coming in at $56 per tonne. And cash production costs plus brine management costs were $74 per tonne.","The significantly lower costs were driven by a high operating rate at Esterhazy and by our now-complete Canpotex proving run at Belle Plaine, which is delivering volumes well above the mine's existing design capacity.","In addition, we have taken out meaningful operating costs through actions large and small, from stopping high-cost production to lowering our brine management expense. Fourth quarter results demonstrate the transformation of our Potash business. And we expect our cost profile to improve further when the K3 mine is operating and we have the opportunity to eliminate brine management expenses. While we're on the topic of K3, this month will bring an important milestone. We expect to reach the potash ore zone at 3,400 feet down in the next couple of weeks.","Our International Distribution business also continues to deliver high margins and good volumes, highlighted by very strong operating results in Brazil. Volumes in Brazil were up over 20% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and margins exceeded our forecast. The outlook for Brazil is strong, which bodes well for our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition.","On that front, integration planning is underway and we continue to expect to complete the transaction later this year. The Vale business is an ideal strategic fit for us. We will acquire excellent assets and a talented workforce at an appealing valuation. And the deal vastly increases our presence in the promising Brazil market.","In Phosphates, we drove down rock cost back to a more normalized level in the fourth quarter, and the team delivered record MicroEssentials production and sales in 2016, as we brought our expanded capacity online. I should also note that the teams in Florida have made tremendous progress on the sinkhole at New Wales. Grouting to repair the hole is underway. And we continue to see no offsite water impacts, as we expected.","Our Commercial team also executed well, with strong fourth quarter sales taking advantage of having our products in the right place at the right time. The team also met its significantly higher 2016 target for MicroEssentials sales, while maintaining the traditional premium over DAP, demonstrating the demand for MicroEssentials continues to grow.","We set another record for safety performance in 2016, our fourth consecutive year of record performance. I believe strongly that safety performance is an excellent indicator of overall execution.","Finally, our aggressive expense and capital management programs are paying off. Look at it this way; the year-over-year impact of potash and phosphate price decreases was $1.8 billion. Our lower costs and capital expenditures helped offset these declines. We generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, and maintained the financial strength to seize a major growth opportunity in South America.","I want to be clear. We are going to remain committed to the expense discipline we have developed across the cycle. Our guidance for 2017 demonstrates that. We expect SG&A cost between $295 million and $310 million, down compared to 2016. And we expect CapEx to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million again in 2017, down from our original expectations of $1.2 billion.","Now, let's move on to the markets and why we are increasingly optimistic about the year ahead. First, potash and phosphate prices continue to move up, even through the seasonally-slow time of the year. In fact, standard potash prices have risen $25 to $30 per tonne in Malaysia and Indonesia. A blend grade price has gained about $40 per tonne in Brazil and more than $50 per tonne in North America from their lows last year.","In phosphates, New Orleans' barge prices were up $35 per tonne since the low last December, while China export prices have surged about $70 per tonne so far this year. Second, the strong sales volumes during the quarter clearly helped establish some price momentum. Even with the high volumes, dealer inventories were low coming out of the fall in North America.","So, we continue to expect strong global demand in 2017. And, importantly, we have seen meaningful reductions in global capacity and production in both potash and phosphates. Of course, there is always uncertainties and we are keeping a close eye on grain prices, currency movements and China's phosphate production.","For more on our market outlook for 2017, I will turn the call over to Mike Rahm. Mike?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. Let's start with potash. We entered 2017 with very different fundamentals than just a year ago. Channel inventories worldwide have been drawn down as a result of continued strong on-farm demand and lower shipments during the last two years.","On the supply side, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of the industry cost curve have closed. We estimate a permanent reduction of approximately 3 million tonnes of annual MOP capacity from the closure or reconfiguration of seven North American facilities.","This, in turn, resulted in a large decline in output last year. For example, North American MOP production was down 2.1 million metric tonnes during the first three quarters of 2016, according to the most recent TFI statistics.","On the demand side of the equation, lower prices have underpinned strong on-farm demand. In North America, we estimate that shipments from producers and importers during the last half of 2016 were up 15% to 20% from both a year earlier and the seven-year Olympic average due to the long fall application window as well as a favorable ratio of crop prices to potash costs.","Reports from our sales team indicate that application rates held steady in most cases, and were up in others as some farmers are rebuilding soil potassium levels, given the low cost of potash. The net result is that potash inventories held by North American producers dropped 50% from the near-record 3.6 million metric tonnes on June 30 to just 1.8 million tonnes on September 30, according to the most recent TFI figures.","The improved supply-demand balance has driven the $50 increase in NOLA prices to $240 per metric tonne today. We expect this positive momentum to continue through 2017. Global MOP shipments are forecast to increase more than 4%, or 2.6 million tonnes this year, the first increase since the 9 million tonne surge in 2014. On-farm demand remains strong and producer shipments will need to closely match projected use this year, given lean channel inventories worldwide. All of the big six consuming regions, North America, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, are forecast to post gains.","Finally, we do not expect material supply increases from either brownfield expansions or greenfield projects this year. All of this bodes well for potash supply-demand dynamics in 2017.","Moving to phosphates, as we said many times, China is the key swing factor and recent developments there look increasingly positive for the global market. Recent statistics and news reports indicate that the widely expected restructuring of the phosphate sector is underway. Production and exports declined last year, in response to both lower prices as well as the recent government crackdown on excessive emissions of air and water effluents. Chinese Customs Statistics show that exports of the leading phosphate products declined 18% last year, a drop of 2.1 million tonnes from the record volume a year ago.","The government reported that 70% of Chinese producers lost money last year, so lower prices are forcing cutbacks in output. In addition, some producers have temporarily shut down as a result of actual or expected environmental audits. The Chinese Government is becoming increasingly responsive to the public's demand for improved air and water quality.","As a result, we project that Chinese exports of the leading phosphate products will decline again this year to 7 million to 8 million tonnes. In addition, it is important to note that tighter environmental regulations and pollution taxes have and will impact even the low-cost producers, which, in turn, is raising the industry cost curve.","This is an evolving situation that merits close monitoring this year. Just like in potash, finished product prices have quickly reflected lower output and reduced product availability. The DAP price FOB China port recently traded at $360 per tonne, up $70 per tonne from just a couple of months earlier.","Looking ahead, global shipments of the leading phosphate products are projected to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes in 2017, up from an estimated 66 million tonnes in 2016. A key feature of the phosphate outlook is continued broad-based demand growth. In addition to expected gains in the big import markets like Brazil and India, significant demand is emerging from other regions, including Africa, Argentina, the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. Demand growth, combined with an estimated decline of Chinese exports, is expected to increase industry stripping margins from the lows of 2016.","In summary, prospects for the global phosphate and potash markets look positive given these recent developments. Prices are moving up and we expect that this momentum will continue this year.","Now, I'll pass the call to Rich Mack. Rich?","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. As Mike's views indicate, we expect stable and improving market conditions with continuing strong demand and the potential for a more constructive pricing environment.","We have been highlighting for several quarters that Mosaic is focused on the things that we can control, notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital. As our results demonstrate, we have made tremendous progress and, as Joc said, we are not going to take our eye off the ball as markets improve.","We are also going to continue to manage our capital very carefully. In December, we previewed a possible modification to our dividend policy, if market conditions did not recover sufficiently to fund our full dividend in 2017. Since then, market conditions have improved. And market sentiment is better today than it has been in the recent past. We expect this improvement to continue through 2017, but the risk is that the pace of improvement remains slow. With this in mind, we have consistently communicated our commitment to investors to maintain a solid financial foundation. And we have decided to reduce our dividend by approximately 45% to $0.60 per share on an annual basis.","Going forward, we will continue to manage our balance sheet to preserve our credit ratings, and we look forward to building from this revised dividend base as our business grows in the years ahead.","Now, I'll briefly review the quarter and the year, and I'll discuss our guidance for the business units. For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.03, which was negatively impacted by $0.23 of notable items. While there is some noise from quarter-to-quarter in terms of notable items, the impact for the full year was close to zero. In total, Mosaic earned $0.85 per share in 2016, a respectable result with the weak pricing environment our industry faced throughout the year.","In Potash, our sales volumes for the fourth quarter were at the midpoint of our guidance range, at 2 million tonnes. And prices moved modestly higher. The volumes reflect a continuation of the strong demand we saw in the third quarter, as well as the aftermath of a robust fall application season in North America. Strong demand leads to higher prices. And we are beginning to see that now, although our guidance is relatively flat in the upcoming quarter.","For the first quarter of 2017, we expect to see continued modest pricing gains in granular and standard markets, offset by contract-driven declines in our higher-priced industrial product as well as less industrial in the mix. The combined impact leaves our guidance for the quarter at $165 to $180 per tonne. We expect continuing strong demand as channel inventories remain low as we move toward a contract with Chinese customers.","Our volume guidance range of 2.15 million to 2.3 million tonnes is narrower than usual, reflecting the fact that 85% of our product is already sold. There is limited upside because very little product is available. The increase year-over-year is also indicative of the strong demand and lean pipeline inventories Mike mentioned earlier.","Our gross margin rate in Potash rebounded to 16% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our near-record low production costs. Our guidance for the first quarter margin rate is around 20%. While costs will remain tightly controlled, the restarted production at Colonsay and the completion of our Belle Plaine proving run are likely to result in slightly higher costs per tonne.","In Phosphates, volumes were above our guidance range as our customers took ownership of inventory to rebuild depleted inventories. Global demand has been persistently strong, with concerns over shrinking availability and rising raw material costs which have incented the channel to lock in product and drove average prices higher toward the back-end of the quarter.","With this as a backdrop, our first quarter guidance for Phosphate volumes is 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes. And DAP prices, FOB plant, are expected to range from $315 to $335 per tonne. As of today, like potash, over 80% of our volumes are committed and priced. Current spot prices for finished phosphates are higher than our guidance range, and we expect to realize those higher prices in the second quarter of 2017. Our Phosphates margin rate for the quarter was 9%, which was at the high end of our guidance range. We expect a gross margin rate in the upper single digits in the first quarter, as higher prices are offset by higher raw material costs.","As Mike pointed out, stripping margins have compressed for phosphate producers in 2016. We do expect, however, a gradual recovery with the key factors to watch being Chinese production and exports.","Moving on to International Distribution, which continued to generate strong results as we closed 2016; excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand, highlighted by very strong MicroEssentials sales. Sales and prices were also strong in India, where we saw a good rabi application season, and in China, where potash inventories remain low.","Gross margin per tonne remained very healthy, at $31 per tonne, as prices rose and our teams managed costs downward. For the first quarter, we expect margins in International Distribution to be approximately $20 per tonne, down slightly from the fourth quarter, reflecting natural seasonality in our Brazil business.","Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was once again negative, due to relatively constant tax deductions and our lower taxable income. We expect our 2017 full year tax rate to be in the upper single digits, as a result of expected higher profitability and slightly lower deductions this year.","To summarize, the fourth quarter was a solid end to the year for Mosaic, considering difficult market conditions. We generated good cash flow, controlled our capital spend and cost environment, and made some difficult decisions that will position us well with momentum heading into 2017. Going forward, our expectations are that the cyclical upturn will allow us to pay down debt and achieve our target leverage ratios within reasonable timeframes. The prudent, but difficult, actions we've taken to conserve the balance sheet have put us in excellent position for improving markets.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Rich. Let me articulate where I think we are in the cycle as we head into 2017. We are confident that we have seen the bottom in both phosphates and potash prices, which are now gradually recovering from cyclical lows. We are well-positioned to benefit from that recovery.","We've made major strides last year in our strategy, in our operations, and in our cost structures. And we have earned significant leverage for stronger markets. 2017 is going to be a busy year for us, with many work streams to prepare for an excellent integration of Vale Fertilizantes business.","As we work through that process, we will maintain our focus on superb execution and capital preservation, even as we continue to look for additional opportunities to create long-term shareholder value.","Now, we will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I just want to ask what the Phosphate segment margins and you touched on this a bit in your prepared remarks. We've definitely seen prices running higher in the spot markets, but the first quarter margin guidance was a little disappointing and it didn't seem to really reflect much of an improvement quarter-over-quarter.","So, maybe it's a timing issue, like you were saying, and maybe second quarter margins get better, but there's also changing input costs and a lot of variables that go into it. So, maybe if you could just walk us through some of those expectations and how that might be changing over the next several quarters throughout the year. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Andrew, Joc here. Yes. Certainly, I'll hand it over to Rick to talk about this a little bit. But in the first quarter, we expected this to be a seasonally-slower than average, which is one of the reasons why the price doesn't improve as quickly as all of that and, of course, it's the timing of the sales.","At this point in the quarter, we're largely committed for the whole quarter, which means that it's going to take some time for that new pricing to run through the system. I'm going just to hand it over to Rick to just give some details on that.","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Andrew. We're here at the TFI this morning and we've been with our customers since Sunday. And, frankly, overall, the customers are accepting the changes that are going on in the phosphate market, in fact, are probably more concerned about availability for their usage.","In the last 45 days, we've seen phosphate prices in North America increase $40 a short tonne. We've seen phosphate prices for Tampa go up $35 a tonne. You've seen China prices go up $70 a tonne. And so, with all of this, you're always selling into a market that's appreciating. And so, as Joc says, we're well sold into the first quarter, and we're very positive about what we expect realizations to be in the second quarter. Rich?","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","And, Andrew, just one final point and that is, in the first quarter, we do have some turnarounds at some of our plants in Florida that we didn't have in Q4. And so as we move into later quarters, Q2 and beyond, hopefully, we see some improvements there with some additional pressure on ammonia prices.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Without sort of getting into a specific price forecast, I'm wondering if you could just sort of talk about what you think the trajectory of prices will be in potash and phosphate. And I guess what I'm really asking is you mentioned in 4Q you didn't see sort of the typical seasonal slowdown in prices the way that we might have in the past. So, I'm wondering if as we move through the spring season this year and get into sort of the summer doldrums, do you think we'll sort of see the seasonality of the prices resume or do you think we're just sort of on a slow steady glide path through the balance of the year, regardless of seasonal demand?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Vincent. What I would say to that is, look, we're heading into the year in a very constructive situation for both commodities. Both phosphate and potash seem to be \u2013 as Rick said, people are accepting the price increases that are coming. We would expect that as we get closer to spring and maximum demand seasonal, that those prices would continue to rise and maybe rise a little faster. And obviously, it's going to get a little softer as that spring season ends and we go into fall and refill season. Rick, do you want to kind of...?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","I think the only thing that I'd add is when we take a look at what we saw in the last year at this time, there is less inventory, both in our hands as well as in distributors' hands around the world, which we're showing that, a very good first quarter forecast for both P&K. But the second quarter, we're not catching up to people that want to charge distribution systems, that \u2013 and buyers that have been buying hand-to-mouth. So it'll be interesting to see what happens in that typically slow Q3 period, to see if inventories have caught up to demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. I was wondering about your distribution business in Brazil; first, just tactically on the quarter, how much of that growth was Mosaic versus market? And can you talk a little bit more about what you're thinking about this business strategically, particularly after the Vale acquisition?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Jonas. Good morning. Yeah, first of all, look, we've long said we think Brazil is a very attractive market. I think this result that we had in the fourth quarter really reflects Brazil overall. I think the numbers are out now. There was 34 million-plus tonnes of fertilizer delivered to Brazil this year or in Brazil this year, which is another record. It continues to grow at 4% or 5%.","The one standout for us versus the rest was, of course, our performance of MicroEssentials. We really were able to capitalize on our ADM acquisition and take big advantage of our growing footprint there. And how it's going to fit in with Vale, I mean, we think they're very complementary. Again, after a long-winded introduction, I'm going to give it over to Rick to talk a little bit more about the Vale and how we see those two fitting together.","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah, Joc. Thanks. The acquisition of the Vale business is going to, as Joc says, fit really well to what we have. One, it's complementary as far as areas where we have not built solid market positions. That's one. But I think the bigger issue for us as we look at this, Joc and I just came back from a week of visiting all the Vale assets and the senior leadership at each of the facilities. And we walked away with what we believed, but a lot more confidence in the fact that we've got good long-term assets that we're going to have that are going to allow us to grow. The people we met, that are leading these businesses, are good, solid. We have good solid people coming to join us. And you just walk away after traveling through Brazil and visiting with people in agriculture about just what the opportunities to grow in that market will be. And, frankly, we'll be very well-positioned with assets, people and Mosaic's products like MicroEssentials.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts, UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. With the rise in coal in China, could you talk about where you think stripping margins for Chinese producers are and how much more phosphate capacity might come offline?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, John. I'm going to hand that straight over to Mike Rahm. Dr. Rahm does a lot of work in this area. And I think he probably has a pretty good handle on where those costs mean for China.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Joc, and good morning, John. I think as we indicated, we're guiding exports at 7 million to 8 million tonnes next year, so that indicates that we expect that there will be further declines in phosphate production in China; can't get into too many details in terms of the nature of their cost curve, but, as you know, it's a very, very cost diverse industry. And, as we mentioned in some of the prepared remarks, the government has reported 70% of phosphate companies there are losing money. So, we do expect further reductions in both production and exports. And it translates into about a 2 million tonne drop in exports in our view of in 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Morning. Just a two-parter; so, first, you're projecting yourself to grow your potash volumes by 6% in 2017. I think your commentary was you don't expect any greenfield capacity coming on in 2017. Can you just tell us how you'll get 6% higher volume when you consider Rocanville reducing your allocation, when you consider Agrium adding volume and then the K+S legacy mine supposed to come on in June.","And the other question was, you talk about that you're 80% sold for potash for Q1, but I think Canpotex put out comments that you're fully committed for Q1. So, can you reconcile those two statements? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Joel, good to hear your voice. First of all, K volumes, yeah, our K volume for the year is, we believe, exactly in line with how we've worked out North America Canpotex share and the growth of the global market. I'll let Mike talk about that in a second, but, before I do, you asked the question about us being 80% sold while Canpotex is fully committed. And, yes, Canpotex is fully committed to the quarter. And that means probably in North America, we're largely sold, but we still have a few sales left to go.","Mike, do you want to just go through the potash volumes?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Yeah. We're projecting, as we said, a 2.6 million tonne increase in global shipments. We think Canpotex probably will capture about half of that. So, if you think of a 1.3 million tonne potential increase in Canpotex shipments, our share, our entitlement first half of the year for Canpotex is 38.1%. We think after the completion of our Belle Plaine proving run as well as the completion of Rocanville, that will drop a bit. We're using a little bit over 37% average for 2017. So, if do that math, that's about a, say, a 450,000 to 500,000 tonne increase in shipments through Canpotex.","And then in the domestic market, we think there's probably a little bit of upside there in terms of demand, plus we're seeing a nice rebound in our K-Mag sales. So, you add 500,000 tonnes with a couple hundred thousand tonne increase in North American MOP and K-Mag sales and you land right in the middle of our guidance range.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And I'll just add here, we do expect some K+S tonnage, but they're not going to come, we don't believe, till quite late in the late. And when they come, we'll deal with that.","The other comment to make here is, yes, Rocanville will come on with new tonnage, but we will also have an increase due to our Belle Plaine proving run, which we've just completed.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","And maybe just one final point, Joel, just as a reminder, these adjustments for Canpotex purposes don't kick in until July 1, and Canpotex is scheduling a very robust shipment schedule in the first half of 2017.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Mike, a question on your phosphate outlook, you talked about a $70 rebound in Chinese pricing. So, to what extent will that lead to reopening of some of the shuttered capacity or maybe, said another way, how much of the Chinese reductions are driven by economics? How much is driven by environmental restrictions? And then, in the second half of the year as we see new capacity from OCP and potentially the Ma'aden start-up, hat impact could that have on your market outlook?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Don, thanks. Well, let me just start by making a general comment of China. Look, we have long expected China to have to do some overall restructuring of their industry. They have some great low-cost producers, but they also have some very high-cost, old, highly environmental-impact sites that I think they're going to have to do some real reconciliation of. So, I think there's going to be a change in how that industry looks. I'll let Mike go on to the detail of how much of that is price-driven, how much of that is environmental-driven.","The next comment, though, is with our forecast of China going down another 1 million tonnes or so, really, we see that more than offsetting new production from OCP and we really don't expect the Ma'aden to have a material impact until much later in the year. And even then, we see it starting up, but it's a mega project. It'll be a slower ramp up than instantaneous. Mike?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Don, you hit on all the critical swing factors, I think, in the phosphate business. Throw in crop prices, and I think you got all of them. But those are tough questions.","As we said earlier, there are some uncertainties. We do think that the changes in China are driven, to some extent, by economics, but I think there are also very powerful industry associations that understand that restructuring has to take place. We've often referred to the May meeting of their phosphate association, where they have indicated that they think 3 million tonnes of capacity in P205 terms needs to be shut down. And so, yeah, economics will play a factor in this. But I think there are other things at work there that will achieve the objectives that the industry association has stated.","And then I think Joc has covered the new capacity coming on later in the year. That certainly is an issue that we'll monitor very closely. The only thing I would add is that in terms of OCP's capacity, I mean, they have done a very good job developing demand for those hubs. And their sales in Africa have been outstanding, and that market continues to grow.","I think there's also issues in terms of how quickly they can get tonnes out into the market. I think right now, we're seeing loading delays out of Jorf. And it's almost reminiscent of what happened in 2014 where all of a sudden, you had buyers come to the market realizing that the bottom was in, and you had this big, big surge in demand, and all of a sudden, the realization that there are some loading constraints. So I think there are a lot of things at play right now. But bottom line, you identified key risk factors, but, at this point in time, we still feel pretty good about the outlook for phosphate, but we'll monitor these closely throughout the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew J. Korn - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. If you could, could you help me unpack your CapEx guidance a bit for the year? What's the K3 amount earmarked in the range? What else is in there that's significant in terms of growth? And then, lastly, with ore production at K3 pending, which I'm taking from your earlier comments, when would your cost benefits start flowing through? And is there anything within the K3 ramp that's leading to the increase in your brine expense year-over-year? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Matthew. So, just to unpack our CapEx, as you say, we've done a lot of work to reduce our ongoing sustaining capital. We've made a real point of taking that down to, let's say, the $500 million range, which means that probably the big ones are still the major capital items that are still to spend. Those include, probably, we'll be coming to the end of Ma'aden this year. I think there's a couple hundred million dollars left to spend there that we'll see. And then, of course, we have K3.","K3, we are actually, as per my comments in the start, hitting ore at K3 if not next week, probably within the next couple of weeks. So, we're largely through the major cost of building the shaft and sinking the shaft. So, it'll be fitting out the shaft. It'll be running conveyors over to K1 and K2. And then it will be \u2013 most of the development work, which will be to turn the hole in the ground into an operating mine. On that, we expect to spend somewhere in the range of the $150 million to $200 million a year for the next three or four years doing just those activities. And then, that'll probably come to an end not until likely early next decade.","Your question on brine, I'd just like to say on brine, I mean, we've guided $160 million, $180 million which might be slightly conservative against this year. There's a high level of uncertainty in brine, depending on what Mother Nature throws at us. If we get a higher brine inflow rate for a period of time, we will spend a little more money addressing that. So, we've had a good year this year, from that perspective. And if all goes well, we'll spend the same or even less. But if there's a brine inflow, we will have to address it. So, that was the reason for the range on our guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve Byrne. You guys made some comments earlier about improvement in pricing in standard markets in potash, but some degradation in industrial markets. Can you remind us to your industrial mix in both potash and phosphate in 2016 and expectations for 2017 and then how you think about the relative attractiveness of those markets over the next couple of years? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you. Yeah. I think just I'm going to introduce it and hand it over to Rick to talk about our mix and whatnot, but, just to be clear, the industrial market is priced somewhat differently than the agricultural market. And it's normally based on a trailing price from the agricultural market. So, while they move in slightly different timings, they do follow each other over time. Rick, do you want to talk about our mix and...?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Just the industrial market for us on phosphates is, frankly, a non-factor. Most of our industrial product is in potash and those are with, as Joc described, longer-term contracts. Now, going to kind of global potash markets, we've seen nice increases in granular product or blend grade product, into Brazil where we're at $250 for delivered potash as well as we've seen good strength into Southeast Asia, where standard potash is around $240. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","I just want to say with this industrial, the other aspect of the industrial is because it lags, we've seen better than agricultural prices for the last six months. And as you hit the bottom, it will end up with a three to six month lag as we go up the market. But, overall, like I say, it'll fall off. In terms of percentage, 10% of our overall potash sales are industrial.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yonah Weisz from HSBC. Your line is open.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)","Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to maybe follow up on the industrial question in phosphates with animal feed. PotashCorp was saying the animal feed market is taking, seeming, a severe beating in North America. How do you see phosphate animal feed into next year?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Yonah, thanks for the question. There's no question. I think the feed market has been under a little bit of pressure lately, competitive pressure, mostly from probably the imports. But, for us, that's not a huge piece of our profitability. I want to just point out, you refer to the other company and their phosphate business. We service very different markets. We very much service the ag market, where they service more the industrial market. And so, we've had a few questions comparing the two, and I don't think they're really that comparable because we service such different markets.","Rick, do you want to talk about the feed market a bit?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yes. The only thing that I would add is, for us, the feed market is about 5% of our total phosphates. It's a good segment for us. We're set up with some of the major integrators in North America and around the world. And, yes, we've seen pressure in the short-term, but that comes and goes. Our customers are long-term and we have good agreements in place with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","This is Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Could you just discuss the sustainability of the pricing pressure we're seeing in some of the key international phosphate rock markets? And further to that, how you see the rock S&D balance evolving in the mid-term now that some of the major expansions in Saudi Arabia and Morocco are behind us?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","I'm going to hand that straight over to Mike. When we start talking about the global S&Ds, he's really the guy to talk about it. Mike?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","All right. Good morning, Oliver. Yeah, there has been some pressure in the rock market, but I think things are stabilizing a bit. I just read the results of, I think, of Bangladesh tender here this morning for 72% rock netting back to about $100 both in Jordan and Morocco. So, I think many of those fundamentals have played out. And our assessment is that the rock market is probably going to stabilize here for most of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on your views on India, on the phosphate market, some of the swings in supply and demand there that you're looking at in the first half. And, more broadly, you didn't provide kind of the regional breakdown for potash and phosphate demand or shipments in the slide deck. Is there any way to discuss what would drive you to the upper or lower end of your bands? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Adam. Again, we're going to let Mike go through the S&Ds of the India phosphate market. Maybe Rick can talk about a little more of the near-term stuff and the regional distribution of the potash.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Yes, certainly. Well, as you know, imports and shipments in India were off this year as they drew down stocks. Now, we think that that process is largely behind them. Inventories have been pulled down. We're projecting that shipments in 2017 will rebound a bit to kind of that 9.3 million to 9.5 million tonne range, up from about 9.2 million this year. And that imports will rebound from less than 5 million tonnes, about 4.8 million I think is our current estimate for last year, to about 5.3 million.","And I think the key feature in India is that, as you know, they just announced their preliminary subsidy. And that was positive, I think, for both P&K in terms of a larger number of rupees allocated to that. So, I think some of that reflects the anticipation of these greater volumes. So they're facilitating, I think, import economics.","So we think we that India is on the upswing. On-farm economics there are just fine. And the rupee has seemed to stabilize a bit. And all the kind of stars and moons are aligned for a recovery there. And I guess the real important part, I think, is just the pipeline, both P&K visible inventories have pulled down, but our team in India has used the term bone-dry to describe what they think are retail inventories at the literally thousands of small shops throughout India.","So, we have factored in increases, and I think we're on the upswing and a positive trajectory there. And if anything, we think there may be a little bit more upside than what we currently have in our forecast.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Graeme Welds - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good morning, everyone. This is Graeme Welds on for Chris. I was just wondering if you could give us a quick update on what's going with the ammonia off-take agreement with CF. And also just curious, given the moves we've seen in ammonia pricing since the start of the year, how does your contract with CF, how favorable is it relative to where it was last year? Any color on that would be really helpful. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Graeme. Sure. So, as you're well aware, the ammonia prices spiked a fair bit in the last negotiation. I think we were up $70 over up to $320. That's largely the issues going on right now in the Ukraine between the Russians and the Ukrainians. And gas availability has put short-term tightness in that market. I would say that's certainly not likely to stay as long-term tightness, or at least we're not expecting that, but certainly it has created some short-term tightness.","In terms of our contract with CF, I'm going to ask Rick to talk a little bit more about that, but just to be clear again, this is a eight-plus year contract with volumes of 600,000 to 800,000 tonnes. It will be based on the Henry Hub price of natural gas that will determine the price. So, at any given time, it may be in or out of the money. I think, at this stage, it is probably slightly out of the money. But we are not delivering against that yet. We'll start delivering at against it in the second half of the year.","Rick?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. The only thing that I would add, Graeme, is that we are building a specific tug and barge to move the ammonia from their plant to Tampa. And I think we said that that's been delayed. So, we've developed workarounds with CF for the first half, and we expect to begin pulling product in the back half of the year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. So, we probably have time for two more questions and then closing, so, Operator, back to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to dig a little deeper into the timing on the Chinese negotiations. I know it's always tricky, but kind of given their inventory situation, do you have sort of a timeline that you're anticipating as being for a resolution? And between China and India, who would you expect to go first this year?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yes. Thanks, Michael. I'm going to make a little bit of a different comment, which is that really from Mosaic's perspective and certainly for Canpotex and the rest of them, we are very reluctant to talk a whole lot about that China contract. There's active negotiations. We understand that those will start after Chinese New Year, which is this week. But beyond that, really, I prefer not to speculate on that because I think that actually effects the negotiations themselves. And so, I'm going to take a pass. I know it's a different approach from others in the past. But also, from our perspective, A, it effects those negotiations, which I don't like. But what I can tell you is demand around the rest of the world is really good right now.","As was mentioned earlier, Canpotex is fully committed for the first quarter. So, we're not in a huge rush in. And I got to tell you, although China is a benchmark contract, it's not as relevant as it once was, certainly not for us because there's a lot of other material that we move around the world. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. After your Vale acquisition, you will be unique in that you will have production and distribution in the country. Does that help you place more of your North American production in Brazil?","And then secondly, quick question for Mike Rahm; you mentioned about India, you didn't mention about demonetization, if that had an impact in fourth quarter? And if it did, is there a snap back in 2017? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, P.J. So, yes, Vale is a production business. They have their own customers, which are, in a large part, different than our customers. So, their servicing slightly different places in the country and in a slightly different way. A matter of fact, we are one of their large customers already. So, there is good synergy there. Our goal will be to as we look at Brazil, we'll be looking at it as holistically as we possibly can. So, there will be times when it may pull more of Mosaic's product from North America through, but we also have opportunity to pull more of Vale domestic product through our own distribution system. So, I think it works both ways and I think there is a real opportunity to optimize the net-backs overall to Mosaic.","In terms of demonetization, our view is it probably hasn't had a big impact because there has been substantial and steady demand. Rick's in charge of our International Distribution, so he might have a little more to say on it, but, overall, our belief is that has been minimal impact.","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. P.J., we saw a lot of talk about how big the impact was going to be on kind of November and December shipments of demonetization. And, frankly, November was a record for shipments in India in-country. And, as Mike commented, our group says we pulled down inventories at the retail level to a position of bone-dry and so, frankly, a lot of noise, but, in effect, not much impact.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. So, I would now like to close our call. And to close, I just want to reiterate our key themes. First, Mosaic is executing across all of our businesses and all around the world at a very high level. Second, the markets are improving, whether they're fast or slow, but they are improving month-over-month, week-over-week.","And, third, Mosaic is in an excellent position to capitalize on better business conditions. We are working to maximize the opportunities with Vale Fertilizantes acquisition and what that acquisition will provide, while managing costs, preserving capital, so that we can create long-term shareholder value.","We look forward to providing you with a more detailed look at our strategy and progress at our Analyst Day at the New York Stock Exchange on April 12. So, thank you for joining our call. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will share insights into our results and our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on managements' beliefs and expectations as of today's date, November 5, 2013 and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Jim.","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings discussion for the third quarter of 2013. We have a lot to talk about today. So let's get right to it.","First, as you are all aware, the external business environment was very challenging during the quarter and that is clearly reflected in our results. We operate in a capital intensive cyclical industry where prudent capital allocation is critical to competitive success. While troughs are a part of every cyclical industry, these periods provide significant opportunities for companies like Mosaic, companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to execute an effective strategy.","Our earnings reflect the difficult operating environment but it is worth noting that Mosaic was still able to generate operating earnings of $144 million on revenue of $1.9 billion. These results include $142 million or $0.22 per share in negative notable items. These are largely non-cash, and they are primarily the results of strategic decisions that I will discuss in more detail.","We have built a highly resilient business and we continue to manage the company for the long-term as our results and actions this quarter demonstrate. The current market conditions do not change the long-term outlook for Mosaic or our strategy. We are focused on building reliable long-term sources of cash flow and we are succeeding at that in both business units.","In phosphates, our Saudi joint venture is progressing well and we are reinforcing our advantage cost position. In potash, our expenses remain on budget and on schedule and we are in the process of demonstrating the capacity of Esterhazy K2. Our innovation lead continues to grow with the launch early next year of our new potash premium product, joining the strong performance over MicroEssentials product.","We have also made major strategic strides in the past few months, further positioning Mosaic to achieve its vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Last week, as you know, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire CF Industries' phosphate business for $1.2 billion plus $200 million for their asset retirement escrow.","We also reached a long-term agreement for CF to supply Mosaic with a substantial portion of the ammonia we need to manufacture phosphate products. These deals make perfect sense for Mosaic and for our shareholders. Because of the proximity of CF's South Pasture mine to Mosaic's planned Ona mine, we will no longer need to build a full beneficiation plan at Ona, which would have been a $1 billion investment.","The ammonia deal, allowed us to forego a proposed ammonia plant in Louisiana, which would have cost $1.1 billion. Most important, after the transaction closes, we will have increased phosphate capacity to help meet growing global demand and capture substantial and highly probable operating synergies.","We recently reached two additional strategic decisions. First, we intend to sell our assets in Argentina and Chile and exit our distribution business there. Our business model simply did not match with the markets' demands, which is primarily a barter market and our profitability was not sufficient to justify continued investment.","Our South America strategy is focused on Brazil, where the future of agriculture remained very bright. Second, we are in the process of decommissioning our small potash mine in Hersey, Michigan, where we are facing significant capital outlays for potash reserve development and where we are preparing to sell it as a salt production mine.","Together, these two decisions and the cancellation of the ammonia project resulted in pre-tax charges of $123 million, which was largely non-cash in the results we reported today. All of these actions fit perfectly with the strategy and streamline our operations, and we expect all the will contribute to greater shareholder value in the years ahead.","Now, I will return to the current markets. Prices for both, potash and phosphate slipped lower, driven by a number of factors, including to name a few, the weak shipments into India and China and late harvest in North America, all of these factors are leading to very cautious hand-to-mouth customer buying decisions.","We have always said that economics will win in the end and we believe that continues to be true. The current situation is primarily driven by good oil supply and demand. Supply is increasing and shipments are temporarily soft. We expect these conditions to persist into 2014, but over time, we expect demand will return.","The world's farmers simply cannot grow their yields and their profitability without our products. As I said earlier, this is a cyclical business, but the long-term trend is solidly upwards.","The 2013 crop is likely to come in as the biggest ever and farmers are prospering and that's very good news for global food security. Even so, even with the largest crop the world has ever produced, yields must grow substantially from here to meet future demand.","Simply extrapolating the trend from the last 30 years, demonstrates the need for significantly higher yields, and of course, more fertilizer application. Farmers continue to reap large profits with their large crops even with moderating grain and oilseed prices.","Revenue and profit per acre matter to farmers. Crop nutrients are extremely affordable they are helping drive strong yields, which in turn drives compelling farm profitability. Over time, economic fundamentals will be in our favor. The outlook for the rest of the decade for potash supply and demand looks balanced, even as new capacity comes online and we expect operating rates to rise to the mid-80% range.","For phosphate, the long-term supply and demand equation is positive and we expect to operate at high rates in that business over the coming decade. In fact, if you look at phosphate demand, it is difficult not to notice the continued steady growth. A trend that bodes well for our two recently announced investments. Overall, the quarter was challenging, but we see brighter days ahead.","Now, I would like to ask Larry to provide more context on this quarter. Larry?","Larry Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim. Given the complex nature of our results, I would like to spend some time helping you understand our performance and then I will provide our guidance for the fourth quarter. Our earnings reflect market realities as well as the largely non-cash negative notable items of $142 million in this quarter including the $123 million in charges Jim mentioned which reflect important strategic choices we have made.","Market set prices for our products but we can control our cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94 million during the quarter, down from $115 million last year. This decrease was driven by lower incentive compensation and benefits combined with the end of costs associated with last year's corporate systems initiatives.","One item that likely has drawn your attention is our negative cash flow for the quarter. Timing worked against us this year. In the month of June, the first month of our seven months stub year, cash from operations was $434 million, so our year-to-date cash flow from operations for the stub trade was strongly positive and is expected to more than double by the end of the year.","We anticipate improvement in domestic demand, now that the North American harvest is winding down and farmers are focusing on fall applications, and this will draw down inventories. While we do not expect any meaningful short term price appreciation, the expected reduction in working capital should result in a more normalized operating cash flow situation in the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the segments. In potash, net sales were down significantly, as a result of lower realized prices and lower sales volumes, primarily to North America, both driven by factors I just described. Note that operating earnings for this segment included the charge for the exit of the Hersey, Michigan potash mine. We produced two million tons of product during the quarter, building inventory as a result of the ongoing Esterhazy K2 proving run, which is nearing completion. Our Colonsay mine remained idle during the quarter.","In the phosphates segment, net sales, margins and earnings were down due to lower prices and volumes as the phosphate business experienced a spillover effect from potash. Buyers of crop nutrients generally got significantly more cautious. Lower finished phosphate pricing was only partially offset by lower raw material prices, which I will address shortly. This segment's operating earnings also reflect two charges, the exit from the Southern column of South America and discontinuation of the ammonia project.","Normally there is roughly a quarter lag between market prices of raw materials and prices we realize in our cost of goods sold. This quarter, however, we have lower sales volumes and as a result, a much longer lag. Much of the benefit from lower raw materials prices went into finished goods inventory. We expect cost of goods sold to decrease offsetting further phosphate price declines as we work through this higher cost inventory during the fourth quarter.","In fact, we anticipate ammonium and sulfur prices realized in our cost of goods sold to decline to $405 and $120 per ton respectively in our fourth quarter. Our results in both segments highlight both the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and the necessity of maintaining low-cost operations. As we discussed at our Analyst Day presentation last month, we are well positioned on the cost curves in both potash and phosphate and we are working to further reduce costs.","Now a few notes on capital deployment. First, we do not expect the CF phosphate acquisition to have an impact on our ability to repurchase shares, whether from the MAC trusts or in the open market. We continue to look forward to late November after which our repurchase restrictions will be lifted. We also intend to take advantage of some of our additional debt capacity in the near future. We were restricted from issuing bonds while we were in material negotiations regarding the CF transaction. Now that we have announced the transaction and will file a current 10-Q, we expect to conduct an offering soon assuming market conditions remain favorable.","Now, I will turn to guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.5 tons to 1.9 million tons compared with actual volumes of 1.4 million tons in the same period of last year.","We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $285 to $310 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Potash segment is expected to be in the mid-20% range. Our operating rate in potash during the fourth quarter is expected to be below 65%, with planned Esterhazy maintenance after successful completion of a proving run.","Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million for the quarter and Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million.","In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 million tons to 2.9 million tons for the fourth quarter, compared to 2.8 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $370 to $400 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Phosphate segment is expected to be about flat with the third quarter.","Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to be approximately 80% during the fourth quarter. Also, for the fourth quarter, we estimate SG&A expenses will be approximately $90 million to $105 million. For the seven-month stub period, we estimate an effective tax rate continuing in the high teens percent range and capital expenditures and investments in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding remarks.","Jim Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. Clearly, our markets are challenging part of the cycle. As we have stated many times, we know our business is cyclical and we plan for the trough, so that we can take advantage of the opportunities they present.","At Mosaic, we are addressing the things we can control and our strategy is working as our very important strategic progress over the past few months makes clear. At our Investor event last month, we reinforce our commitments to reducing sustaining capital and operating expenses and improving our position on the global cost curves.","Our approved potash expansions are on track with work progressing at our Esterhazy K3 shaft, which will give us significant optionality in the future. Earlier this year, we proactively delayed our additional brownfield expansions and Belle Plaine and Colonsay due to higher capital costs.","In the past six months, we have announced the investment in a joint venture in Saudi Arabia, the purchase of CF Industries' phosphate business and an the expansion of our footprint in Brazil, all to position us to capitalize on the very favorable long-term fundamentals.","Today, we have discussed additional strategic decisions, which along with our plans to return excess capital to our shareholders, are designed to optimize returns on our invested capital and generate shareholder value over the long-term. We have build an adaptable company designed to succeed in the dips, accelerate in the peaks and find opportunities throughout the cycle. Our results demonstrate that we can do just that. We are well positioned to succeed now and to amplify our success when not if markets improve.","Regardless of the markets, you should expect more of the same from us, steady, prudent management and a willingness to seize opportunities, all with the continual commitment to generate solid returns for shareholders.","Mosaic's future is bright both, because of our strategic progress and because of the remarkable opportunities ahead. Our future is tied to the greatest challenge of our time, a challenge that will increase for generations ahead feeding this growing planet. The world has to grow more food, a whole lot more food and it simply cannot do so without good crop nutrition. Therein lies the value of Mosaic, an excellent franchise built to withstand the troughs and prosper throughout the cycle supported by compelling future demand story. That's great opportunity for the long-terms for all of our stakeholders.","Now we would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, thank you. Just looking at some of your guidance for volume for Q4, you seem to be guiding to similar volume for Q4 '12 but for some higher volumes for potash. Could you just talk about how you see International and North America in Q4 versus Q4 of last year for the two businesses, how they might differ?","Jim Prokopanko","Sure. Good morning, Joel, Thanks for leading off our question period here. I am going to turn it over to Rick McLellan to address the volume forecast. Rick?","Rick McLellan","Yes. Good morning, Joel. Your question is about how we see Q4 domestic and export versus last year. The thing is, probably the biggest impact on our Q4 is the fact that North American buyers didn't come to the table during our Q3 this year where last year, if you remember, the fall application season and the crop was harvested four weeks ago at the same period last year. So we saw the dealer network not step in for product and year-over-year, we think the export market stays relatively the same. So the growth is going to be, or what we expect to be in the quarter, is all around capacity.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Okay, and just following up. On some of your asset sales you are talking about here in Brazil, excuse me, in Chile and Argentina and in the Hersey mine in Michigan. Could you talk about what self production was in 2012 or calendar '13 and then also in Argentina, what percent of the Argentina, Chile assets would you guess would be attributed to SSP plants and is that capacity on SSP 250,000 tons? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Joel, you asked two questions. One was about salt production. I am going to have Joc O'Rourke speak to that and the other question was about SSP production and Larry Stranghoener, our CFO can answer that. Joc, would you address the salt questions?","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, last year our salt production at Hersey was somewhere in the range of 250,000 to 270,000 tons of salt. So it was approximately four to five times the amount of potash produced at that operation. And we have a long-term contract to sell that salt to Compass Minerals.","Larry Stranghoener","And Joel, with respect to the assets in Argentina. The great majority of the assets there are inventory. It's their prime season right now. So inventory values are quite high. SSP plant is a relatively small part of the asset value but could in fact be the most attractive asset we have for sale.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","Yes. Hi. Can you talk about brine management cost? You were down significantly. Can you talk about what were the reasons behind it? Was it reduced production or your other drilling techniques et cetera?. And what is a reasonable estimate going forward?","Jim Prokopanko","PJ, good day. We are going to have Joc O'Rourke, our Chief Operating Officer leading our production facilities address that. Joc?","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, thank you, PJ. So our brine management cost have been down and that is the combination of some success and some of our, we talked about it a year ago, doing some growth curtaining, as we called it, in some horizontal drilling. That's complete. So that's allowed our cost to come down a little but certainly not related in any way to production because its an independent operation. But overall, it comes down to better management, I think, and some of the success of our (inaudible) programs.","Jim Prokopanko","An PJ, I would just add, ongoing costs are expected to range from $45 million to $55 million per quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Your line is open.","Kurt Schoen - CLSA","Thank you. This is Kurt Schoen, in for Mark. With your cancelation of the ammonia plant, how much more ammonia will you guys need once you expand the Ona and DeSoto mines, and would you guys consider building an ammonia plant at that time to kind of fill that shortage.","Jim Prokopanko","Kurt, it's Jim here. We are going to be deficit. We have the demands for about 1.5 million between what we will have the CF contract and with we produced of our own in the Louisiana. We will have deficit of about 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons and we are considering what the options are to fill that hole.","It doesn't hurt being open to some spot market prices and we will figure out that as we go with this contract with CF being so new, just give us some time to figure out what's the best way to fill that deficit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Perfect. Thank you. On the Phosphate business, you indicated that that may take some time to realized the full benefits of lower sulfur and ammonia costs. Can you give a little more detail on how to think about this going forward as we head into 2014, given particular consideration to current inventory levels? Thank you.","Jim Prokopanko","Larry, why don't you handle that question?","Larry Stranghoener","Yes. I think as we tried to point out on the call, there is typically about a three-month lag and they probably got extended by a month or so, just because of slower sales and inventory build, but generally speaking, if you look at the market prices, those are the prices that were being realizing cost of goods three, four months later. The trends are certainly positive with respect to ammonia and sulfur cost and that's helping up preserve margins in this business even as prices continue to slip a bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Bank","Thank you very much. With respect to Canpotex, we are seeing several of your competitors being more aggressive in product placement strategies as well as several large MOUs being signed recently. Can you talk about whether market share retention, which is I guess the strategy you talked about at your Investor Day. Can that be achieved without having to sacrifice prices any further?","Jim Prokopanko","Good question, Ben, and there seems to be a lot of [built] about market shares. More than market shares, we look for customer retention and Canpotex has been an exceptional add. There aren't many, many customers in the world that want all their eggs on in one basket, so with all the noise and sparks that are going on the in the last couple of months, they are starting to settle down.","We got the world market in the a high 50 millions tons, 57 million tons, 59 million tons. No one supplier can supply all that product, so when they run out of if some customers want to sell it at a lower-price let him sell at a lower price, but we know who our target customers are continue, we continue to serve them, serve them, very, very well and they want to do business with Canpotex, so we are not getting into a market share war here. At least not from my perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning. You indicated that your tax rate for the stub period will be in the upper teens. Why is that? Why is it so much lower than in the first half of the year?","Jim Prokopanko","I have our CFO, Larry Stranghoener answer that. Larry?","Larry Stranghoener","Like all companies, Jeff, we have certain tax preferences, and when income is falling there is somewhat perverse effective of tax rate improving, because we are still enjoying some of these tax preferences against the lower pretax pace which results in a lower tax rate.","I think on a normalized basis, you should think about tax rate in the low-to-mid 20s going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning Larry, it seems you have got quite a few moving parts in your capital budget with CF deal and the ammonia project forgone and other portfolio actions. How would you characterize CapEx prospects for 2014 or even any preliminary comments looking beyond that, in terms of the shape of your spend?","Larry Stranghoener","Yes, Kevin. It's something we are spending a lot of time talking about internally, of course, and planning for. We are not yet at a position to give guidance for 2014 but I think we have seen the peak years of CapEx with the potash expansion program largely behind us at this point, other than the K3 mine. So you should look for CapEx to begin tapering off a bit. Of course, one of the appeals of the CF deal is that is it was CapEx neutral for us. Yes, we are spending $1.4 billion but in so doing, we are also saving about $1.4 billion in future capital outlays. I would call your attention to the slide we used at the Analyst Day presentation that tried to sketch out for you over the next three to five years, what the various markets would be from sustaining capital to growth capital and so on.","Jim Prokopanko","Kevin, that's Jim. I would just like to add to that and it is important questionable capital allocation that you bring up. Being a cyclical business and being a capital intensive business with the scale and scope and cost of some of our expansions, capital allocation is critical to success in this. I think Mosaic's really differentiated itself, building a strong balance sheet able to finance our capital expansions through operating cash flow. We take it very seriously and that's what has been behind some of these repositioning our portfolio. The exit of the Hersey operations. We just couldn't find a way to justify the capital expenditures that were necessary to expand the caverns at Hersey based on the price forecast we have going on and similarly, Argentina and Chile, we are exiting those markets because we just can't see deploying capital and getting the kind of returns we were looking for. So it is an important thing in this business to do that smartly and do that well with discipline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Your line is open.","Jacob Bout - CIBC","Hi, good morning. I had another question here on the Esterhazy brine management. Can you talk a little about any changes that you have seen in the salinity of the composition of the brine? And then, in that forecast of the $45 million to $50 million, maybe you can give us a bit more of a breakdown of what you are spending on pumping versus grouting? That's it. Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Hi, Jacob. It has been a while since we have heard from you. I am going to have Joc address your brine question.","Joc O'Rourke","Okay, Jacob, Joc O'Rourke here. Yes, in terms of the brine chemistry, again it's a little difficult to be exact on it, but we haven't seen any substantial changes in the saturation of the brine at Esterhazy. To your second question, pumping versus grouting, I think if you go back to our Analyst Day, a couple of years ago we did break that cost down and essentially our cost haven't changed in terms of distribution, pumping being about a third of the total cost, grouting being about a third and drilling being about a third of the major cost and those would account for 80% of the cost of managing brine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you. Jim, a question on potash pricing. You are guiding down about $30 in the fourth quarter. You have talked about how you think that we haven't seen the bottom yet and the price would deteriorate further into next year. So where do you think prices trough?","Then as I look at slide nine, which is your longer term outlook, you have got a bump in global operating rates in 2014, but then a flat line for the next five years. So are you expecting prices to remain flat? Or do you think that producers will start shutting some capacity or maybe we will get a bump in demand out of India to help with the pricing what's otherwise a flat supply demand environment?","Jim Prokopanko","Yes. Hi, Don. Good to have you on the call. The potash question about, I will take the supply side or the demand side and Rick will talk to you a bit about the price outlook. We are expecting continued 3% growth annualized in the potash business over the next number of years. It's going to be lumpy and we have proven that. You just don't know when it's going to come but we will see over this decade a 3% annual growth rate.","What has been an anomaly over these past two years is the reduction in demand by two consumptive markets, India in demand, India and China, I should say. Their demand shipments into those countries are both, down about 2 million tons each, so both countries combine 4 million tons has been removed almost 10% of 7%, 8% of the annual demand has been removed by those actions. We don't think that is sustainable, we are convinced that both of those markets are going to come back and we are anticipating that some time by the end of this coming 2014 year that we will see that demand begin to come back.","The other aspect of it is what's happened in the pipeline. There is shipments and that is what is down 4 million tons between India and China and there is farm consumption. In our reports and our study of the market is that the farmer consumption isn't down to the same level that shipments are down. We think the Indian farmers are applying good rates to both potash and phosphate and we are seeing pipeline, stocks drawdown, so with the recovery and eventual and I think within 12 months, we will see a recovery in China and India. We will start seeing more pricing, the prices firming up and we will start seeing prices move up.","I am going to turn it over to Rick and see if he has any color to add about what we see in the next - you asked about the fourth quarter pricing.","Rick McLellan","Hi, Don. Although we don't see any business on potash being consummated in India or China, we do believe that either late this calendar year or early next year they will have to come in and Jim talked about the pipeline destocking and that will be the impetus that will provide a move for price.","The good thing about markets destocking is that we are seeing it in India, we are seeing it in China, we are seeing it in Brazil, three of the big markets and we have had a very good start in October to the North American fall application season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Yes. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper in terms of the outlook for phosphate next year, you guys have talked about sort of where you see the potash demand and shipments being for next year. Could you talk a little bit more about phosphate? How big of a deal is the India subsidy system with respect to phosphate and how big could we expect the shipments to be in India for 2014 in phosphate? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Michael. Rick McLellan, our commercial leader will take that question.","Rick McLellan","Yes, Michael. If we look at next year, our expectation is 64 million tons to 66 million ton of phosphates globally, and that will be the fifth concussive year of demand growth for phosphates. When we look at India, Jim talked about it a bit. We believe that while imports have declined on DAP to near 4 million tons this year, channel inventories at retail distribution have been drawn down at as part of applications have been solid, so this would frankly imply that we will see imports into India next year at 6 million tons to 6.5 million tons of DAP, which is part of what we expect the growth to be in the market. The second question, could you repeat it please?","Jim Prokopanko","I will just to add on to that. Rick called it out, but we have seen five consecutive years of year-over-year growth in the phosphate business. I just want to underline we got tremendous confidence in the growth of the phosphate business, the necessity of this is the one of the three principal nutrients and that's what's behind our conviction in investing both, in the Saudi phosphate joint venture as well as the most recently announcement agreement we have with CF to buy their phosphate business. This is a good solid business with steady growth prospects proven and into the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping if I could - more into the potash inventory situation, you have built about 580,000 tons of inventory in the quarter and your 4Q operating rate guidance and volume guidance, at the lower end would say, you don't expect to draw that down at all. Maybe talk about how comfortably you are carrying current levels of inventory into 2014 and maybe any more color on the split between standard and granular product that you have that would color how you would respond to a demand recovery in India, China versus the U.S. and Brazil ?","Jim Prokopanko","Good day, Adam. Good question. Particularly with us having our K2 proving run going on. So there is some explanation needed. I am going to have Joc and Rick speak to that to the inventories of potash.","Joc O'Rourke","I am looking forward by talking about the Esterhazy proving run. As you are well aware, I am sure the way we determine our allocation with Canpotex is by doing these proving runs. So they are quite important in terms of recognizing the value of our expansions. At Esterhazy, we are nearing the completion of our proving run and we expect that we will demonstrate a capacity consistent with our already declared annual increased capacity. So that's going very well. But what it has meant is, we have had to run an operation, a little harder than we would normally run or a lot harder than we would normally run, particularly in this market. So it's meant, we have added inventory, at the same time we have had Colonsay shutdown for two months which has tried to mitigate it, but we are still increasing inventory.","With that, I am going to hand it over to Rick to talk about the demand side and how we are going to deal with that.","Rick McLellan","Yes. Adam, as you look going out of the year, there's a couple of point of clarification I will make. The high-end of our range is the expectation that there will be some tons go to both India and China. And at the low end of the range is mother nature working against us in North America. So right now, we are very comfortable with the ranges we have provided and we think the market, frankly as we look at what our inventories will be at the end of the year, it will give us that flexibility to respond when the pipelines are drawn down and the market begins to move. If we think back over the last two year's, Q1 has been really strong for potash.","Jim Prokopanko","Yes, I would just add to that. This market that we have experienced over the last two to three years, these aren't slow slowdowns or slow startups. Things happen pretty quickly these days. So having some inventory and having a buffer to respond when the markets come back and when they do come back, I think they will coming roaring back and that will happen quickly. So we will be well prepared to serve that market as the demand picks up.","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Your line is open","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Good morning, Jim. You talked about being able to control costs in this tough market. I wonder if you can talk a little more about Carlsbad. You did refer to that in your cost curve analysis at your Investor Day. Is it possible there to curtail potash production while maintaining K-Mag production?","Jim Prokopanko","Mark, I have said it earlier and you are highlighting it. Everything is on the table. The potash sector has had quite a shock since July 30 causing everybody, I think, certainly I could speak for Mosaic, causing us to reassess how we deploy our capital. And that's a question we ask ourselves. Do we continue to run our Carlsbad facility? Continue to run the MLP? Slack demand that we are seeing now, we might not need that capacity. But it's a question we have asked ourselves. We are studying. K-Mag is a great market. We have no intensions of curtailing any K-Mag. So it's important we keep that going. And stay tuned. You will hear more from us.","Larry Stranghoener","Mark, it's Larry. Just to be clear. Yes, we could operate the K-Mag part of the plant without operating the MLP part of the plant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could you give us just some, maybe more specifics on the time of the expected buyback? Larry just confirmed that you looked to participate in the debt markets by the end of the year and you have talked about balance sheet optimization by the middle of next year.","First, is it still the intent that the lion share if any repurchases will be probably be done by late spring? Then secondly, you said you don't expect to see a transaction to impact your ability to buy back shares. What could feasibly happen to change that type of outcome or that expectation, maybe could you not go to the debt markets when you want, could approvals for the deal get pushed back? Things kind of linger? What would happen there?","Larry Stranghoener","Matthew, it's Larry. I don't think I am going to give you the kind of detail you would like to hear in that it is not clear yet how many shares we will buy, from whom we will buy them, when we will buy them. It depends a lot on market circumstances, it depends upon the willingness of the trust to sell their shares, willingness to sell how many of those shares which isn't clear to us yet, so it's still a bit of fluid situation.","I would go back to what we have been saying. We have got capacity of roughly $4 billion between debt capacity and existing cash. There are some calls on that capacity. This EPA escrow account that we have described to you before and it is described in our 10-K and 10-Q, other strategic opportunity that might come up, but in the end we still have ample capacity for share buybacks, we have got a strong desire to return capital to shareholders via buyback.","Of course, we will have no restrictions left after late November, and so we will look forward to developing and finalizing our plans at that time. I would add one final comment with respect to our balance sheet targets, we said that we want to hit those targets by mid-2014, so Matt you process all of that information and you can come with I think some reasonable estimates about what we are likely to doing and when we are likely to do it.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yes. Just a follow-up on your FPD program, I know in Slide 13, you talked about how your volume dropped considerably on that, so how much of your potash is moving out on that? Are you having to give a steeper discounts off list in order to induce the dealers that to hold material?","Jim Prokopanko","Hi, Don. I am sorry, we dropped your first question and we didn't get your second question. I am going to have Rick address that now","Rick McLellan","Yes, Don. Year-over-year, we are up. We don't talk about what we have in the program, but we are up on volume. As far as discounts, right now we are in gut slot and people are taking the inventory that they have and it's moving to market at the prices that we expect.","Jim Prokopanko","Well, with that I am going to conclude our call and I would like reiterate a couple of our key messages.","First, we understand the cyclical nature of our industry and we have planned well, so that Mosaic can thrive in the peaks and in the troughs. Our financial strength and conservative management approach are proving to be valuable assets.","Second, we are making important strategic progress, highlighted by the Saudi joint venture, the pending phosphate acquisition and our decisions to exit underperforming businesses.","Finally, the long-term outlook for Mosaic remains extremely compelling. Economics, supply and demand will prevail and demand for our products will grow along with the population and the need for more food.","Thank you for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2016 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Dr. Mike Rahm, Vice President, Strategy and Market Analysis.","We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In addition, during this call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP measures are in our quarterly performance data also available on our website.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. This morning, I will give you an overview of our results, then Mike Rahm will discuss market conditions, before Rich Mack takes you through some details on our performance for the quarter. I will have some final thoughts before we take your questions.","The key concepts that we want you to understand from this call are: first, we anticipated improvements in the business in the second half of the year, and those improvements have begun to materialize. We continue to maintain a constructive outlook for the industry; second, the actions we've taken to lower costs and optimize assets combined with our scale and secure market access, positioned us to maximize the benefits of improving market dynamics; and third, our Brazil-centered growth strategy is clearly paying off.","Our investment in MicroEssentials capacity expansion and the acquisition of ADM's distribution business came together to allow our International Distribution business to meaningfully exceed expectations this quarter.","Now, let's discuss the markets. Mike?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone. Markets during the third quarter played out close to our expectations. Let's start with Potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market: one, on-farm demand remains solid worldwide; two, large channel inventories are getting worked down; and three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment.","On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year; its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second highest during the last five years.","As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly, as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds, and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.","Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million tons to 63 million tons in 2017, with the current point estimate of around 62 million tons. That computes to a 4%, or 2.5 million ton jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million tons. The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big six consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017.","In the case of Phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter, as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material costs resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth.","We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tons to 65 million tons to 66 million tons this year. China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the two largest phosphate consuming countries.","In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. Just like potash, several supply side changes are taking place.","China year-to-date exports through September are down 29%, or 2.4 million tons from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tons in 2015 to about 8.6 million tons this year. A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tons of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity, or 6.5 million tons of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or two.","Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million tons to 68 million tons. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.","Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And two key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp up.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong, and limited additional price appreciation in the near term.","Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs, and our capital.","For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full-year effective tax rate accrual.","Our cost-reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings, and keep in mind that we made two acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions; and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last nine years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense-reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.","We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets.","As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next five years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully; and as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.","With meaningful changes to our five-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.","We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 times to 2.5 times net-debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.","Now, I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top-end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tons. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago in earlier periods.","In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 per ton to $175 per ton. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million tons to 2.1 million tons, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower than normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold-out position for the fourth quarter.","Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range, and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.","We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand, and continued cost-reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter, and expect our gross margin rate to be in the mid-teens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.","Moving on to Phosphates, our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold, and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock reclined to $60 per ton during the quarter.","Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock costs than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock costs at or near current levels.","Our average Phosphate's realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting, and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs. As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million tons to 2.4 million tons, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 per ton to $330 per ton.","We expect relatively stable margins with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.","Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics, and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017.","Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not.","Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings.","Gross margin per ton came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per ton margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption. As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date.","With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per ton, and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million tons to 1.9 million tons during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower than normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold-out position for the fourth quarter.","Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full-year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion, combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near-term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full-year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.","To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Rich. Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of processed water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around the clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it.","The key points for investors to understand are first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any off-site (16:24) impacts from the water loss. Collection walls are retaining the water, and we are pumping that water back up to another area of the gyp stack. We have done and we'll continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact.","Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. And third, based on the work we completed so far, and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.","Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment, agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals, are improving; albeit slowly. And Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.","Just as important, our work to reduce costs is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation, by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully.","Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.","Now, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks, and good morning. So, my first question would be on the leverage ratio, how does your current leverage ratio compare to your new target range? And then second, in your prepared remarks, you've been pretty strong defending the balance sheet, but with the lower cash balance and some CapEx spend still remaining, how does that tie together with the overall dividend strategy? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Andrew. So, I'm going to hand most of this over to Rich, but let me just re-emphasize. We do take a conservative view with respect to our balance sheet. But also, we don't take a one-quarter view with respect to any of this. And I want to highlight that while the operating cash flow was relatively low this quarter at $96 million, if you take it over two quarters, we were $679 million over two quarters, which is down only 14% from last year. So, while we do have capital still required, we're generating good cash flows, and of course, we will continue to assess how those two fit together.","Rich, do you want to talk a little more about our CapEx?","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Joc, and good morning, Andrew. First on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the cargo split off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time.","Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer. We're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 times to 2.5 times, and I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis.","We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it, and there are times when we're going to be under it. And, I think it's all guided by the guide post of a strong investment-grade credit rating, and we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that.","And then, moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now, obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactivity reduced our spend, both in capital and in operating costs.","Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that, particularly in the Potash business and also with the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividends.","So, what I would simply say, in summary, is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes, and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses, and cash available for dividends.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Jonas. I'm going to start here and I'll hand it over to Rich. But a great lead in for I think what is a great story, which is our MicroEssentials story.\nFirst of all, yes, we did increase capacity. If you'll remember, we spent $250 million to increase the capacity of MicroEssentials at our New Wales plant. That largely got completed at the end of the second quarter. So, it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down.\nHowever, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sales, and that's all due to higher availability. So, you know, with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity.\nAnd sorry, I think I might have said Rich's name, but I will hand it to Rick to give us a little more detail. Rick McLellan.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, good morning. I'll just add to what Joc said, the production that came on at New Wales allowed us to point extra tons towards Brazil in the third quarter. And so, our growth in MicroEssentials is really coming out of this new production, and is occurring in Q3 into Brazil, and Q4 in North America.\nAnd just a reflection of how we're changing, our MicroEssentials sales for the third quarter were a record ever for Mosaic. And up until now, we've been supply constrained. Now, we can go and look at those markets where we've been developing the market for this product.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd just highlight as well, just before we leave that, I don't want to miss saying that the big benefit in Latin America is, we not only get the producer margin for the MicroEssentials, but we also take that distributor margin. So, it's a great market for that product.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThanks. And good morning, everyone. Question on your CapEx forecast going from $1.2 billion to $800 million. Could you just give us a sense of what's allowed it to come down so much? And is there any impact to your plans for K3?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSure. Thanks, Vincent. Let me say, first of all, we prioritize our capital as we've always prioritized our capital, which is making sure we protect the integrity, both mechanically and structurally, of our plants; that our key strategic projects continue on pace. But beyond that, we assume that all of our capital is negotiable. And so, what have we done? We have reduced or eliminated any capital that we believe isn't in that critical group for now. Some of it has been deferred. Some of it has been eliminated.\nAnd in terms of K3, we absolutely are focused on maintaining the critical path of the K3 project, and we will be getting to the bottom of that in February, or a little later than February, and continuing that project on schedule. Next year, our focus is to have a capital allocation of between $800 million and $900 million, and then decreasing to $800 million after that. So, thank you.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd, Vincent, this is Rich. Just one supplemental comment to Joc's review there. And that is, keep in mind, we have spent ample capital in prior years, and so the condition of our assets and the quality that we find our businesses in right now, are in great shape. And so, that does allow us some additional flexibility to time some of the spending in the years ahead of us.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. Good add.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi, good morning, thanks very much. I was listening to Rich's comments about the ammonia barges earlier on. I just wanted to clarify it somewhat. Does this mean you'll be taking ammonia from CF in mid-year 2017, rather than at the beginning of 2017?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSimple answer is yes. I'll leave it to Rich to give any color to that.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYes. Your assumption is correct, Jeff. I don't think there is any more color to it.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. And...\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nJust to add one thing, Jeff. We've made an agreement with CF to handle the delay, so we're taking tons from them, but in a different manner than through the barge.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.\nMark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC\nThank you. Just to circle back to the CapEx question. Is it fair to assume that the $600 million target still has a decent amount of growth CapEx in it? And where would that growth CapEx tend to be focused post Esterhazy?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSorry. Hi. Thanks, Mark. First, let me clarify. I heard you say $600 million, we're $800 million to $900 million.\nMark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC\nI'm sorry, $800 million.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, next year. And so, where is that focused? Let me just break it down. Our sustaining capital, which we were targeting in the $600 million range, we're now targeting in the, let's say, $450 million or $400 million to $500 million range, and the other $300 million to $400 million will be spent on growth capital.\nThe first priority one is clearly Esterhazy K3. We have a few small projects that are coming to completion like the New Wales MicroEssentials plant, the barges and others. And then, we'll be focusing I guess early in the next decade probably on the new mines in Florida. But other than that, most of them are complete.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nYes, how much of that $650 million of cash that you have is offshore, and therefore would be subject to tax if repatriated?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSteve, I'm going to hand that straight to Rich to give you the details for the cash positions.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Steve, I don't have an exact number for you, but there is a portion of it that would be offshore and be subject to the minimal withholding taxes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nOliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)\nThis is Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Could you please provide some color on the dynamic that you're seeing in the global rock market? We're beginning to see some pricing slippage in international markets that have been stable historically. And then, how does this play into your stripping margins, which we've seen falling for the last few years?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay, Oliver, I'm going to hand that straight to Mike. Mike keeps pretty close tabs on the global S&Ds for all of the, both potash but mostly and obviously the phosphate products. So, I think the phosphate rock market is something Mike keeps pretty close tabs on.\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nSure. Good morning, Oliver. Yeah, you're correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, and that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock you typically contract for a period of time. So, as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust.\nThat said, we haven't seen a Draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP, less the cost of ammonia and sulfur. So, it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time, but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a question in potash in North America. Your volumes in the quarter were up pretty strongly, you've laid out an interesting outlook for producer inventories through early next year to be down maybe about a million tons year-over-year and 1Q 2017. Can you talk about your view on distributor inventory levels into early next year? And specifically, thinking about your shipment outlook for North America to be flat year-over-year, if you're actually seeing underlying consumption growth with the American farmer? Thanks.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThanks, Adam. I'm going to leave this over to Rick, but let me start by saying, yes, in fact, we believe the distributor \u2013 or sorry, producer inventories are well down and going to continue to go down, due to curtailments, including our own Colonsay curtailment and good demand in North America.\nIn terms of the distributor and channel inventories, the market has been such that nobody wants to have extra inventory in their system. So, I think that bodes well for people buying hand to mouth, which means there isn't a great build-up in that channel. But, I'll let Rick give that some color.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Joc. Good morning. Frankly, there's a couple of things happening. I think Joc's \u2013 between Joc and Mike's information, we've seen and we'll continue to see producer inventories draw down.\nIn North America, we're shipping only to people that are buying right now. So, we aren't able to, because of our own inventory position, kind of fill the pipeline, like maybe in other years that we would have. And early indications coming from the farm is that at this type of price level, application rates are as good or better than we've seen in the last two years. Mike?\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, I would just add maybe a little bit of a global perspective. We've seen global shipments come down the last two years by about 1.8 million tons per year, and that goes back to the big build of channel inventories worldwide in 2014. If you recall, from the charts that we've shown earlier, shipments in 2014 ballooned about 9.2 million tons. And it has taken a couple of years to work that down.\nAnd I think what's exciting, I think there's a very good and under-appreciated story in potash shaping up for 2017. We are finally going to see I think growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tons or so, due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore.\nAnd secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with North America alone about 2.25 million tons of capacity, get permanently closed. So, you add that all together, and I think the projected producer inventories that we're showing for North America are probably similar for most producers around the globe. So, bottom line is, I think there have been some very positive developments take place in the global potash market.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJoel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)\nHi, good morning. I had two questions. So, first on Colonsay, I know you talked about making a decision whether you will keep Colonsay offline in 2017 or make it later. But can you give us a bit of insight into where you are right now and the puts and takes on that decision?\nAnd my second question would be, you guided to earlier this year that the issue at New Wales, the sinkhole, would cost maybe $20 million to $50 million over the next couple of years. I think you've spent $60 million in Q3. I don't know if there's some insurance or some accruals going on, but can you give a little color on that? Thank you.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThanks, Joel. Well, let me touch on Colonsay first. So Colonsay, we shut down to ensure that we maintained our inventory position over this period of time to what I would say is low but manageable levels.\nAs we go into 2017, we're frankly expecting a pretty good spring for all of the reasons that Mike Rahm has just explained. So, we're believing that it will probably be necessary for us to be starting up Colonsay in the early new year, as per the original expectations that we set.\nIn terms of New Wales \u2013 and I'll let Rich \u2013 Rick talk a little bit more about Colonsay in a second, and the potash market in North America; but in terms of New Wales, yes, we certainly guided to, I think, $30 million to $50 million. And the difference between the upper end, the $50 million, and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve. This is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 months to 20 months. So, it's not a cost today.\nAs per the original expectations, we expect that repairing the hole will take around the $30 million. Other treatment and whatnot around the plant will take the second $30 million. And Rick, do you want to talk about the potash market?\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Joc. Good morning, Joel. Just to add to Joc's comments about needing to bring back Colonsay early in the new year, as we look at global inventories in country, we're sitting in Brazil right now with their in-peak season, but there's a lot less inventory sitting in distributor hands there.\nWe're seeing drawdowns in India, and the market is beginning to move a lot faster in China. So, we see those inventories in the distributor hands globally being drawn down; and for that purpose, we're going to need to make sure that we've got the inventory to make that happen.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThe other thing I just want to not let that comment about seasonality get missed. Our demand for this product is highest in those spring months, and we have to be positioned to meet our customers' needs. As we've always said, we're very disciplined. We will run to value, not volume; but when there is a market need, we will have the volume available for our customers. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nChristopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\nPerfect. Thank you. You've seen the Chinese take off a few million tons of phosphate capacity this year, which has clearly helped offset some increases elsewhere, but you've also seen the remaining export FOB prices continue to decline, which has been reflected in lower central Asian prices. So, can you just comment on your expectations for the phosphate global cost curve over the next few years, given the high price Chinese capacity is now being offset by lower capacity in the Middle East and North Africa? And how should investors really kind of parse out these themes through 2018, 2019? Thanks.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. I think this is easiest to just let straight over to Mike. I might add a bit at the end, but I think Mike Rahm can give us some thought on the...\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Chris. It's a good question, and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29% to 2.4 million tons. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here, that we'd see about a 3 million ton drop.\nI think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphates, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near-term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit, and they've flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India.\nAnd fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place.\nAnd with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. They are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they too believe that restructuring is needed.\nAnd I guess the bottom line is when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tons, 2% growth is 1.3 million tons per year. Over five years, it's 6.5 million tons, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So, we think that that will happen.\nAnd in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring; and at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient, and a bit more competitive industry. So, I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate; and in the near term, a few adjustments that I think the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook.\nChristopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.\nDon Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nYes. Question for Rich. If you were to do a major acquisition, would you still want to retain your investment-grade rating, or would you be willing to go below that for a while? Or, said another way, if you did a major acquisition, would you have to issue equity to maintain that investment-grade rating?\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nGood morning, Don. We started out as a non-investment grade company in 2004 when we were formed. This industry just is not very conducive to be in that mode for any meaningful period of time. And that's one of the reasons why being investment grade is as important as it is to us. So, I think that's a pillar here, and I think you would expect that we would not \u2013 at least, as currently envisioned, want to slip below non-investment grade, even in the context of an acquisition.\nDon Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nAnd any update on where you are in discussions with Vale?\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nWell, that's something you see these in the news. We read the same things that you do in terms of these market rumors; but, as you know, we can't comment on anything that we do relative to M&A, and that has been our long-standing policy, and it remains the case today.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nLet me highlight; however, though, that if we were to look at any acquisition, it is very situational. How we would use equity, how we would use debt, it's going to depend on how that affects our credit metrics, how affordable it is, how much cash flow the acquisition might bring, and the long-term returns to Mosaic. We always said that anything we do is going to be focused on adding long-term value to this company and their shareholders.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Yonah Weisz from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nYonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)\nYes, hi, good afternoon. A question or two if I may. First of all, given the operational issues that you've had with the sinkhole and I think with the U.S. Department of Labor issue, would you not think that a bit more sustaining capital could be needed in 2017 to shore up these type of safety issues?\nAnd in addition, could you talk a bit about how you see taxes developing in 2017? What kind of tax rate you think you may be paying?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. I got to understand if I got the questions right. So first of all, the sinkhole is part of our capital and expenditures that we will spend in 2017. We go through a very detailed and comprehensive process to determine our capital needs; and in doing so, decide what we can do, balancing off our need for cash, the benefits of long-term sustaining capital, et cetera. So, all of those things come into play. The sinkhole, in terms of capital, will probably be about half of that $60 million will be capital, and so it's virtually not an issue from a capital perspective.\nI don't know what you're referring to in terms of Department of Labor, so I'm going to leave that. But recognize that the sinkhole itself, a natural event. These things do happen. It's very unfortunate. And our goal is to make it right. We take it very seriously, and we will make it as per before. We will treat the water, and we will spend the money that it requires to do a great job of that. That's our social commitment.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd, Yonah, this is Rich. If you were referring to the RCRA settlement or matter that we had previously, that would be included in our forecasted capital. So, we wouldn't see any incremental capital beyond what you've heard earlier today.\nYou asked a question about taxes in 2017. I think that taxes at least in the short-term with the lower level of profitability, because of just simply the lower pricing environment you have for phosphate and potash, you should expect that in 2017, a good proxy for our effective tax rate would be around 10%. And then as the cycle continues to turn, in 2018 and later, a normalized level for us would be approximately 20%.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts - UBS Securities LLC\nThank you. How much of the margin improvement in International Distribution is timing effects? I assume what you're buying is going down faster than what you're selling.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI'm going to hand this over to Rich \u2013 or Rick, sorry. Now, clearly, as you sell down inventories at higher prices in a distribution business, you'll make some gains; but the underlying performance of the business is actually improving, and that's driving our earnings. Rick?\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, I think when we look at the margin tower that we get in our International Distribution businesses, it's driven by how we go about selling it. It's the logistics, and it's how we choose to operate our plants and our blending plants in each of the countries.\nSo with better utilization and making use of how we move product into the country and how we move it out to the customer, we're able to increase margins. The biggest portion driving the margin increase is us being able to deliver a premium product like MicroEssentials in those marketplaces.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Anderson from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nVincent Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGood morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch a high level on your marketing strategy for Ma'aden as that ramps. Are you thinking about maximizing netback on every ton, or targeting larger tenders, or given what we're seeing in the market over the next couple of years, walking that capacity out gently?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI'm going to hand that, again, back to Rick. But let me say, Ma'aden will come in and it offers two advantages to Mosaic that I want to emphasize. One is geographic diversity and the ability to reach our Asian markets at a beneficial freight cost. And the other is just its low, low position on the cost curve, which is a low, sustainable, bottom of the cost-curve position.\nSo, we see that as an important addition to our portfolio of products. How we bring that to market will depend largely on how the market is developing at the time. And as Mike said earlier, we fully expect that this product will be needed as the Chinese industry is restructured. So, let me hand it over to Rick to talk a little more detail of the marketing strategy.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Joc, I think you've really cut to the big items. We've got existing sales books on and will have them. And from a Mosaic perspective, we're going to fit those tons into our existing sales book. And the beauty about having the tons coming out of Ma'aden, is frankly, will be the first multi-hemispheric phosphate producer. And we'll be able to move product to markets, which gives us significant advantage when we go to looking at where we might ship product out of against our sales book. The details of the Ma'aden marketing plant are still being developed, though.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nNow, I'm going to hand it over to Rich Mack to make a couple of comments as well. He sits on the board of the joint venture and is intimately involved in the details.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. And I was just going to speak to timing. We've noted that the ammonia production has begun in Saudi Arabia, and that will continue to ramp up. But I think with respect to phosphate production, as we noted in the past, I think a good date is going to be the middle part of 2017. And this is not like when you are commissioning a brand new plant, you don't just turn on the spigot and have 3 million tons the next day. And so, it will be a ramp-up process, that will take likely several months before we would be anywhere near a full capacity rate.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC\nYeah, good morning. I just wanted to see and dig in a little bit more onto India and your outlook for 2017. Do you see the change in the subsidy levels having a big impact next year? Or do you think it's more just a function that India has worked down their inventories that's driving the growth that you're forecasting for that market? Thank you.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThank you, Michael. I'm going to hand that straight to Mike Rahm again to talk about the India market.\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Michael, I think there are several factors that underpin our optimistic outlook for India next year. One, I'm going to start with the rupee, that has remained relatively stable compared to the volatility of other currencies.\nSecondly, international P&K prices have come down; and as a consequence, that has \u2013 with current subsidy schemes, has translated into lower retail prices. That is underpinning good on-farm demand, which has resulted in \u2013 or is resulting in a pull-down of channel inventories, especially at kind of that retail level.\nAs we go forward, I think there's a great opportunity for India to try to address the imbalance between nitrogen, phosphate, and potash use. And I think what they've done so far with the subsidy is conducive to trying to achieve a better balance. So, I wouldn't see any major change in that. I think given where international prices are headed, given a stable outlook for the rupee, there will be a subsidy in place that continues to encourage P&K consumption in India.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.\nJacob Bout - CIBC World Markets, Inc.\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my call. Joc, maybe you can comment about how you're thinking about the recent wave of consolidation in the ag, chem and fert sector. Do you think you need to be bigger to be competitive? And maybe, specifically, thinking about the potential Agrium\/Potash merger, how does that change your operating environment?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, thanks, Jacob. Look, in terms of consolidation, we have long said that there would likely be consolidation towards the bottom of the cycle. Having said that, bigger is not necessarily always better. I'm not referring directly to any of those. I think they have their own benefits and their own reasons for doing it.\nBut for us, particularly, I don't think we need to be bigger to be competitive. I'm very comfortable in our competitive position. I'm very comfortable in our position and how we will compete with those bigger companies. And particularly the NewCo, or combined Agrium\/Potash company. I feel comfortable we can compete with that.\nHow does that affect our strategy? Look, I think our strategy has long been to serve our customers well, make sure we run for value, not volume, to make sure that we run for a long-term customer relationship that gives great service and product to our customers. I believe as long as we do that, we will do very well in any market.\nOkay, we have time for a couple more questions here, and then we'll have to go.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nP.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nYes, good morning. Joc, you mentioned bigger is not better. Your competitors are merging, and you are going to be smaller in relation to their size, but you also don't have the kind of cost-cutting opportunity that they will have. So, would you be willing to align with another, let's say, smaller distributor?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI think that's getting into a little too much detail to ask if we would align with a different distributor. We have a number of customers, all of whom are important to us. Including CPS, Agrium's retail arm, is an important customer. I don't believe the alignment of retailers with suppliers is necessary, or in this case.\nBut, I want to go to your other comment about not having the cost-cutting potential. I think Mosaic has cut $575 million over time, or is committed to and close to completing a $575 million cost-cutting program, which I believe is industry-leading. We have seen fantastic changes in our cost structure. We've done great things with respect to our capital management. So, again, on a per-ton basis, we absolutely believe we have the same potential to cut our cost, and we believe we are as focused or more focused on cost than anybody else in this industry.\nOperator\nAnd your final question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nBrett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nThanks for fitting me in here at the end, guys. I appreciate it. Mike, just wanted to ask if you could talk about some other currencies in your outlook into 2017 impacting potash pricing, specifically Russia or China?\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Brett. That's a good question. To some extent, we think the key potash currencies kind of follow oil. And I guess if you've got a view on oil, I think you have a view on some of the key currencies.\nIf you look at what the Russian and Belarusian ruble have done since the first quarter of 2014, they collapsed about 55% through the first quarter of this year. With some improvement in oil prices, we've seen the Russian ruble appreciate a bit. And I think, looking ahead, I guess, we're not oil experts, but I think if you're trying to assess where that's going, having a view on oil is probably your best guide.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. Thank you. So to conclude our call, I just want to reiterate a couple of our key messages. First, business conditions are improving, and have improved throughout the quarter as expected, and our outlook remains positive. Second, the actions we've taken to reduce our costs, to optimize our assets and lower our capital spending are clearly benefiting our bottom line. And third, our International Distribution business is exceeding expectations, primarily because of strong economics and our investments to grow in Brazil.\nMosaic remains well situated to succeed through this low point in the business cycle, and to thrive as conditions continue to improve. So, thank you for joining our call, and have a great day.\nOperator\nThis concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Please proceed, Laura.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will share our views on Mosaic's results, as well as current and future market conditions, and Larry will discuss key drivers of the segment results, as well as provide insight into future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management\u2019s beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date, July 17, 2012, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our earnings discussion. I'm pleased to report that Mosaic concluded a very strong fiscal 2012 on a high note. The key messages I would like you to take away from today's call are these: first, external factors created some challenges for us and the rest of the industry; second, Mosaic made important and significant progress in fiscal 2012; and finally, prospects for our business this year and beyond are very positive.","Mosaic is in an excellent position to achieve our vision of being recognized as the best crop nutrition company in the world. Before I begin, I draw your attention to the dividend announcement we made today. We will increase our annual dividend policy by 100% to $1 per share. This significant capital commitment to shareholder distributions comes after a 150% dividend increase just 5 months ago. So in total, we will have raised our dividend 400% this calendar year. This decision reflects our confidence in continuing to generate strong results and cash flow over the long term.","In fiscal 2012 alone, we generated a record $2.7 billion in cash from operations. Even with the substantial dividend increase, we have ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in the business, as well as return additional capital to shareholders. Now let's review fiscal 2012 performance.","I'll start with a view of the external factors that influenced our results, and then I'll discuss Mosaic's accomplishments. After Larry conducts the financial review, I will conclude with a review of what's ahead in Mosaic's bright future.","In fiscal 2012, global crop nutrient markets were impacted by ongoing turmoil in India and by risk-averse behavior elsewhere. Customers around the globe decreased their inventories to avoid exposure to price uncertainty created by macroeconomic developments, including the European debt crisis, as well as unpredictable potential events in agricultural commodity and crop nutrient markets. Still, we finished the year with a fast and furious spring application season in North America and a strong start to what we forecast will be record shipments in Brazil this year.","During the fourth quarter, the global potash and phosphate markets diverged as a result of different supply and demand dynamics impacting each nutrient. In the case of phosphate, the global market tightened and U.S. producer inventories dropped due to record and, in some cases, compressed demand in major consuming countries with the exception of India. We project that the global phosphate market will remain tight given the prospects of record shipments in 2013 and continued nagging supply uncertainties.","In the case of potash, the global market is stable. World shipments are projected to decline this year as a result of a drop in demand in a few countries, particularly India, as well as a drawdown of large inventories in several of the major potash-consuming countries. As a consequence, producers filled warehouses and then throttled back production earlier this year. We estimate that distributors in several key countries de-stocked channel inventories during the first half of 2012 and are now either back in or on the brink of returning to the market. The best evidence of this is that Canpotex exported just over 1.4 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2012 and almost 3.1 million tonnes in the second quarter.","North American statistics indicate that the domestic pipeline also is at low levels today and that dealers will need to restock for an expected strong fall application season. We project that the combination of this uptick in shipments coupled with normal summer maintenance will result in a significant drop in North American producer inventories and bring the market into better balance going into what we project will be a blockbuster 2013.","Against those market factors, I feel great about our strategic progress and the strength we can exert as the world's largest producer of phosphates and potash. Simply put, I believe we have the most powerful combination of assets, talent, innovation and global reach in the crop nutrition industry.","In fiscal 2012, we marshaled these strengths to sell about 19 million tonnes of crop nutrients to customers in approximately 40 countries. For the fiscal year, we posted record revenues and nearly $2 billion in earnings, capped off by increasing momentum in a strong fourth quarter. We achieved a return on invested capital of 15%, and we distributed a record $1.3 billion to shareholders or over 65% of net earnings.","We executed well on many fronts during the year, and I would like to go through some highlights. Our program to improve operating excellence in our Phosphate business is now delivering annualized avoided costs and cash savings of over $200 million. We are committed to maintaining and improving our low-cost operating position. In fact, we have a 5-year plan that targets an additional $200 million in annual savings.","We generated new records for phosphate rock production at our Four Corners and Wingate mines. Our cost per tonne at Four Corners continued to decline, and it is actually lower now than it was 5 years ago. We improved our leadership position in North America, particularly in phosphates. Our program to increase potash operating efficiency achieved annualized savings of $80 million, and we're continuing to identify ways to offset inflationary pressures in Saskatchewan. We invested more than $800 million on potash expansions during the year, and these projects remain on schedule and on budget.","In fiscal 2013, we will begin a 2- to 3-year ramp-up of over 1 million tonnes of new potash expansion capacity, and I'm especially proud to report that we had our best year ever of safety performance. We recorded 32.2 million man-hours in the year, an all-time high, and we managed to reduce the number of days lost to injury by 54%. While a single injury is one injury too many, we're making great strides. In fact, in the fourth quarter, Mosaic employees worked 8.3 million hours, and we had just a single lost time injury.","Mosaic expanded its innovation advantage in fiscal 2012, and we set a new record of sales of MicroEssentials. We have begun to produce and ship that product from our Faustina, Louisiana plant, as well as from Florida. At present, we have the capacity to manufacture 2.3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials per year. It's important to note that our innovations extend beyond products. Our cogeneration of electricity continues to reap important environmental and financial benefits and so do our innovative water reclamation and reuse programs.","Fiscal 2012 also saw the resolution of some lingering uncertainties. Our South Fort Meade mine is ramping up production now that we have resolved litigation regarding the mine, and we expect it to be able to operate at full capacity soon. We have the capacity to produce 5.5 million tonnes of phosphate rock annually at South Fort Meade, which is one of the most efficient mines in the U.S. In May alone, we produced over 280,000 tonnes of rock at South Fort Meade.","We also reached resolution of the dispute over a tolling agreement related to our Esterhazy potash mine. In January 2013, we will essentially have an additional 1.3 million tonnes of potash production peaking capacity at no capital cost to Mosaic. And we completed the initial formation offerings for the Cargill split-off, placing or repurchasing 157 million shares of stock. By the end of fiscal 2013, many of the deal-related tax restrictions will end, which will give us increased flexibility to return capital to shareholders.","This year, we took several steps to improving our capital efficiency. We restructured our debt and reduced our average interest rate from 7.3% to 4.9% while increasing our average debt maturity to 15.7 years. We purchased 21.3 million shares for $1.2 billion, and as already noted, we will have increased our dividend by 400% in the past 6 months. All these accomplishments led to strong results and positions Mosaic well for the future, especially considering the external challenges.","Now I'll turn it over to Larry to review our financial results, and then I'll come back to give you my thoughts on fiscal 2013. Larry?","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Thanks, Jim. Our solid results this quarter reflect the busy spring application season in North America and strong demand in South and Central America.","For the quarter, consolidated revenues were down slightly year-over-year at $2.8 billion, with the decline primarily driven by lower phosphate pricing and lower potash volumes. As Jim indicated, we saw a divergence in potash and phosphate markets in the quarter. Phosphate demand and pricing strengthened, while potash remained stable. And while year-over-year results were down, we saw significant improvement versus our third quarter and finished the year on a strong note.","We generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter and a record $2.7 billion for the fiscal year. As a result, we now have $3.8 billion in cash, and I should note that the vast majority of that cash, over $3 billion, is currently available to us. It is not restricted.","Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.19. That number includes several items that negatively impacted EPS by $0.06. The foreign currency transaction gain of $0.02 per share reflects a gain related to movements in the Canadian dollar, offset by a loss related to the Brazilian real. The vast majority of the impact to this income statement line is noncash and noneconomic, though we also report the mark-to-market impact of hedging our future potash expansion spending. I'll address the other items in my segment commentary.","In Potash, average pricing remained flat and slightly above our guidance range, primarily because of the mix of domestic and international volumes and the extended spring application season in North America. Volumes were at the upper end of our guidance range if we exclude the approximate 100,000-tonne impact of the Canadian rail strike. For the North American potash industry, producer inventory levels remained roughly flat during quarter and are higher than historical averages. It's important to remember that some inventory building is required to manage through normal summer shutdowns for maintenance. At Mosaic, we will also be doing some major expansion tie-ins, which will extend our downtime.","Additionally, there is a notable difference in inventory levels by type and grade of the product. For Mosaic, much of our inventory is currently standard grade, and blend grade inventory is much more limited. The Potash gross margin was down year-over-year as a result of a $19 million swing in mark-to-market charges included in cost of goods sold, as well as lower operating rates and higher brine management costs. These higher operating costs were partially offset by lower resource taxes. Our previously announced curtailments resulted in an operating rate of 85%, down from 95% a year ago.","Brine management costs were $63 million in the quarter, with most of the incremental spending going toward horizontal drilling technology as we managed higher average inflows in the second half of fiscal 2012. For fiscal year 2013, we expect brine management costs to remain roughly flat with 2012, assuming similar inflow rates. In addition, we are investing approximately $100 million of capital for new brine disposal capabilities.","Because of current disposal constraints, we've increased the amount of brine stored underground until the new brine injection site is operational later this year. That said, we have substantial underground storage capacity remaining, and most importantly, we do not expect any of our brine management activities to impact mine operations. Resource tax declines were due in part to a change in our estimated completion date of sustaining capital investments.","Moving on to the Phosphates business. For the quarter, average prices moved lower year-over-year but steadily increased during the quarter. Volumes were quite strong, driven by high demand in both North and South America. In fact, shipments to Central and South America offset the lack of shipments to India. In addition, we have seen significant interest in summer fill programs and have contracts in place for a substantial portion of the product we can deliver in the first quarter.","Phosphates gross margins improved sequentially and exceeded our guidance range due to stronger sales of MicroEssentials and higher prices, which were driven by higher-than-expected demand. Operating earnings in the quarter reflect $21 million of additional asset retirement expense related to the closure of inactive facilities in Florida. Over time, a portion of this amount reflecting accelerated closure will lower future risks and costs.","Raw material costs declined sequentially as expected. However, we are seeing increased pricing pressure on ammonia as supply has tightened. In the first quarter, we expect these higher raw material costs to impact our cost of goods sold. In addition, we expect a seasonal shift in our sales mix to more blends, which have a lower gross margin rate. All else equal, we expect that the first quarter Phosphates gross margin rate to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter with higher prices offsetting these cost increases.","Before I turn it back to Jim, I'll provide some additional guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We expect Potash volumes to be in the range of 1.8 million to 2.2 million tonnes and prices in the range of $415 to $440 per tonne. The sequential decline in price reflects both summer fill discount pricing and a shift to more international business. We expect operating rates to reflect the planned summer turnarounds but to remain above 70%.","In Phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 million to 2.8 million tonnes. Tight markets are likely to continue, increasing our expected average price to a range of $510 to $535 per tonne. Operating rates will include scheduled turnarounds but are expected to remain above the 75%.","Our new annual guidance for fiscal 2013 includes $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in capital expenditures, $320 million to $380 million in Canadian resource taxes and royalties, $420 million to $445 million in SG&A expenses and an effective tax rate remaining in the upper 20s. I would also like to reiterate our capital management approach for fiscal 2013. First, note that we maintain a minimum liquidity target of $1.5 billion, including unused lines of credit. Today, that would imply almost $3 billion in excess cash on our balance sheet. We are also committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. Even so, we have substantial unused debt capacity and flexibility.","Second, with respect to uses of capital, our top priority is to invest in the business. We expect to fund these investments from operating cash flow. In fiscal 2013, we expect to invest $500 million to $700 million in potash expansions. We are also considering building new ammonia capacity, which would bring our ammonia production capacity to approximately 1.5 million tonnes and require approximately $1 billion in capital investment, a portion of which would fall into fiscal 2013. Our second priority is strategic investments like new rock mines or acquisitions or joint ventures. In the current environment, we see limited opportunity for significant strategic investments.","The third element of our capital management approach is returns to shareholders. The primary driver behind our current excess capital position is the Cargill split-off. At the end of our current fiscal year, additional restricted shares issued as part of the split-off will become available for distribution. At the same time, deal-related tax restrictions will end, including restrictions on share repurchases.","For our shareholders, we believe it makes sense to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of these events. In fiscal 2012, we repurchased 21.3 million shares, all that we could under our restrictions, and increased the dividend 150%. And today, we announced another significant dividend increase. You can be assured that we recognize the importance of distributions to shareholders in meeting our total shareholder return objectives.","Now I'll send it back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James T. Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. At Mosaic, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2012, and we have created an exceptionally strong operating foundation for the future. Mosaic has the capabilities necessary to be the best crop nutrition company in the world and to build momentum in 2013.","I'd like to provide an overview of our outlook for the markets and our strategic focus for the new fiscal year. The recent surge in agricultural commodity prices, driven by the ongoing severe drought in the U.S. corn belt, reminds us global food security is tenuous. This year, which started with an early North American spring, the largest U.S. corn acreage since 1937 and the promise of a record-smashing crop demonstrates how quickly agricultural commodity markets can swing and how little margin for error exists in the global food system.","The summer rally in grain and oilseed prices provides a strong tailwind for crop nutrient demand prospects in 2013 and beyond. In particular, we project that global phosphate shipments will increase from just less than 60 million tonnes in 2011 to approximately 63 million tonnes this year and then climb to 64 million to 66 million tonnes in 2013.","In the case of potash, due to the weak start to this year, we project global MOP shipments will decline from about 56 million tonnes in 2011 to approximately 53 million tonnes this year and then jump to 58 million to 60 million tonnes in 2013. Several analysts have expressed concern that the severe drought this year will negatively impact U.S. phosphate and potash use next year because these 2 nutrients carry over in the soil if not taken up by plants. We don't believe this impact will be significant. Based upon a study of similar years and with ongoing high U.S. farm income, good crop insurance programs and growing evidence of P & K deficiencies in key farm states, global grain and oilseed inventories will decline for the third year in a row in our fiscal 2013 as a result of yet another year of below-trend yields.","This situation is not sustainable. Yields must increase at trend rates in order for grain and oilseed supplies to keep pace with steady and predictable increases in global demand. And that, in turn, will require growers to keep their foot on the accelerator, to leverage new technologies and best agronomic practices and to ensure consistent and appropriate crop nutrient applications. We expect these factors will drive strong potash and phosphate demand. The demand for grains and oilseeds will only increase, and crop nutrients will remain a critical component of resolving the global food security issue.","Moving on to our priorities for the new year. In Phosphates, we will maintain our focus on continuing to operate with lower costs than our competitors, and we will continue to grow our innovative premium products. As Larry noted, we are making progress on the feasibility study for a new ammonia plant, which would further enhance our competitive cost position. Together, these 2 strategic pillars differentiate us from commodity providers while driving higher margins and cash flow.","Markets have improved over the past 2 months, driving both volumes and prices above our guidance. While much uncertainty remains for the second half of the calendar year, current market conditions bode well for our fiscal 2013 financial performance. And the longer-term outlook remains compelling. We expect demand for phosphates to continue to grow all around the world while significant investment will be required for supply to keep up with demand. In Potash, fiscal 2013 is an important year for our expansion projects, and we're driving them towards on-time and on-budget completion.","While demand will always ebb and flow, the trend for the decade ahead is unquestionably positive. The world needs more potash to feed its ever-growing population, and we will have the production capacity to meet the increasing demand. We will begin ramping up over 1 million tonnes of new potash capacity during the year, and we will control 1.3 million additional tonnes from the tolling agreement by next January. Our committed expansion spending will decrease in fiscal 2013, even as we begin including the second phase of our Belle Plaine expansion.","Belle Plaine is the world's largest solution mine, and with the fundamental shift in the natural gas markets holding prices at low levels, it is one of the most cost-efficient mines in Saskatchewan. With the planned cost-effective brownfield expansion, we believe it will be one of the world's lowest cost potash mines.","To conclude, we continue to see short-term external risks, including volatile markets in Europe, potentially slower growth in India and China, volatility in U.S. grain prices and ongoing foreign currency exchange risk. That said, none of the economic risks impact the demand for food, which will continue to grow day over day and year-over-year. And Mosaic will have an ever-increasing role to play as we help the world grow the food it needs.","The facts bear repeating. The world's population grows by 75 million people every year, an addition that exceeds the current population of Great Britain, and arable land is not increasing. The demand is multiplied by improving human prosperity around the world. As incomes rise, so too does demand for protein, and protein requires significantly more agricultural production.","I saw an interesting fact recently. The Washington Post reported that the world must produce the same amount of food in the next 40 years as it has in the past 8,000 years. So there is simply no choice. Farmers must increase their yields, and Mosaic will be here to support them. Mosaic has the assets, the global reach, the innovation, the proven execution capability and the capital strength to outperform its competitors in a highly compelling industry. We've built a powerful engine and a talented team of engaged employees. We are prepared to accelerate.","Now we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I guess maybe one question on your potash volume guidance going into fiscal '13 and the step-up to 58 to 60. Could you just dimensionalize which markets you're thinking are going to drive the delta from the 53 to 58 to 60? And I guess particular interest probably on what you think happens to U.S. volumes in terms of restocking, as well as India and China.","James T. Prokopanko","Vincent, it's Jim Prokopanko here. Good question to start with, and I'm going to have Mike -- Dr. Mike Rahm answer that question, and Rick McLellan, our Commercial Manager, to add some color if necessary. Mike?","Michael Rahm","Vincent, yes, as you know, there are 6 countries that account for about 2\/3 of the global shipments: the U.S., Brazil, China, India, Malaysia and Indonesia. And in the past couple of years, it seems like we haven't been hitting on all of those 6 cylinders, and the basis for our 58 million to 60 million tonne increase in potash shipments is the expectation that we will hit on all of those. So we have increases pretty much across the board in those major countries. In the case of the U.S., I think there's an interesting situation in that even with flat or even slightly lower potash consumption, we think shipments will increase from the drop-off that occurred last year in North America. The 2010, 2011 shipments were at a record 11.1 million short tonnes. Those dropped to about 8.3 million tonnes as de-stocking of the pipeline took place. And we expect that in 2012, 2013, we will see those shipments jump back up into the 9 million tonne range.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Jim, I was wondering if you could elaborate on your Phosphate segment ranges put forth for the fiscal first quarter and, specifically, the volume range of 2.5 million to 2.8 million tonnes, as well as some of the sources of gross margin pressure that you alluded to.","James T. Prokopanko","Kevin, that was an anticipated question, and Rick McLellan, our Executive Vice President of Commercial, will add some explanation to that.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, the -- as we finished up Q4, we came out of Q4 with very, very low inventories, and that, combined with some significant turnarounds that we\u2019re expecting in Q1, is going to limit the top end of the volume that we have to ship. And in turn, we're seeing some nice price movement during the quarter. The things that are going to impact the cost, I think I'll have Joc O'Rourke answer that one.","James C. O'Rourke","The costs for the quarter, we're seeing some pressures on both sulfur and ammonia costs, which are mostly due to ammonia tightening up, of course, in the world market, particularly with the nonperformance of Trinidad ammonia.","James T. Prokopanko","Kevin, I'll just add my comment to that. What we're seeing, and we're seeing it throughout the -- and certainly in North America and generally through the world, is a reluctance by buyers to commit. Nobody has any doubt that farmers are going to use phosphate and potash, and as we're seeing in many other industries, commercial enterprises don't want to take a risk or take a -- make a commitment until the very last minute. So yes, there could be some slowness in this quarter, but we expect that will return when farmers are ready to fertilize.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson, Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, just want to continue on that comment of yours about the reluctance of buyers to commit. I know in the past you've emphasized your forward price determined program. I'm just wondering, how extensive is that program? And are you having to increase your investment in that program in order to stimulate shipments? And then just as a follow-on, maybe this is for Mike Rahm, just a comment on we've still got a significant gap in between offshore and domestic potash prices. How do you see that gap playing out as shipments increase in calendar 2013?","James T. Prokopanko","Don, the forward price of contracts that we've had have been very successful. I'll just tell you a bit about them, and Rick will add some specifics around how we're doing with them. They've been very effective at getting product moved, getting into position and being ready for the fall season as it always comes or the spring season. So we're pleased with the performance of that program, and it's built our share and built our position in North America. So it's a program that's been very successful. Rick, do you want to add some explanation on how it's looking going forward?","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, Don, I think your question is did we have to expand it this year, and the answer for phosphates is most definitely not. Potash, we\u2019ve continued to expand the programs what we have -- that we have and the amount of product that we're going to have available into North America. But that's strictly a function of how the potash market has operated. The -- what we found on the phosphate market is people are -- phosphate and potash in North America, customers are willing to layer in percentages of the volumes that they need for fall. So this cautious conservative buying behavior that Jim talked about continues, although we don't find that we've had to do anything different in the marketplace. The second part of your question had to do with the differences between domestic netbacks and export netbacks. One of the things that you have to break away is the difference between blend-grade product and standard product. And as we move over time, those spreads are going to continue to -- the export and domestic prices are going to continue to get closer together. But one thing that impacts the netbacks probably the most is standard product going into contract markets, so it leaves that spread wide. And when you take a look at the North American market, it's a blend-grade market, and so I think one of the ways to look at it is blend-grade around the world continues to trade at a premium to standard.","James T. Prokopanko","Go ahead.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of...","Michael Rahm","The only other thing I would add, Rick, is that when you look at some of the granular markets in addition to North America, Brazil had record imports in 2011 of about 7.5 million tonnes. So we've seen stronger demand in granular markets. And as you mentioned, the standard markets have been off with India's imports being down and most of that product moving in on fixed-price longer-term type contracts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","A 2-part question. When the Esterhazy tonnage reverts back to the 1.3 million tonnes, does that mean that your Canpotex allocation goes up by 1.3 million tonnes? And then secondly, if your phosphate volume in the first quarter of '13 is roughly 2.65 million tonnes, that's down about 500,000 tonnes from where you were in the first quarter of last year. So with that kind of volume step-down, would you expect your phosphate volumes to grow in fiscal '13?","James T. Prokopanko","Jeff, to your first question, simple answer, yes. The 1.3 million tonnes that comes back under the tolling agreement is included as Mosaic Company's share of Canpotex. And to your second question about the phosphate numbers for the first quarter, Rick McLellan will help you with that answer.","Richard N. McLellan","\/>","Yes, Jeff. I'll go back to what I said before. We entered into this quarter with much lower volumes, so that limits our ability to ship during the quarter for phosphates. And one of the other pieces that's going on is a little bit of timing in our international business. So we don't expect a significant change year-on-year in volumes. It's really going to be in -- it's going to show most of itself in this quarter as we began with less inventory and we're -- we have significant production turnarounds at some of our phosphate facilities in Florida.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jim, just a couple of things. When we look at the announcement you took with potash downtime and then the subsequent production, it looks like you ended up taking quite a bit less potash production out of the market than you originally expected. So I'm wondering, is that consistent with the way you think about it? And did your market view change during that period? And of course, where did your ending inventories end up?","James T. Prokopanko","Mark, I'm going to -- with your question, I'm going to -- I'm just thinking how to answer it. I'm going to have Joc help me with it, but we had the desire to impact in terms of matching our supply with the demand that we had out there. So we got back in balance, and we addressed some of our storage issues. And I'll ask Joc to discuss how we -- the actual numbers versus the intended numbers and what happened at the facilities.","James C. O'Rourke","So Mark, in answer to your question, yes, we certainly had the downtime that we announced. We had inventory limitations early in the year, which we addressed by taking some downtime, in particular some longer Christmas shutdowns. We ended the year with higher inventory. However, we feel it's appropriate with the shutdowns we're going to have and particularly with Esterhazy tying in the new circuit, the expansion circuit, we expect we're going to need that inventory for the fall, and we're well prepared for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, can you talk about Chinese pricing for the back half of the year? It looks like they want a decrease while you would like at least a rollover.","James T. Prokopanko","Yes, David. We don't see China doing anything much until sometime in August. Yes, we'd very much like to see a rollover or higher pricing to what was achieved last year. Those discussions and negotiations are currently underway with Canpotex, and we'll see what emerges. What you do have -- what's different in these last few weeks is what's happening in these grain markets, and the question we're all asking is this going to be a catalyst to start moving, increasing, enhancing demand for crop nutrients, and is this going to impact the fertilizer pricing? And it's early to make a final call, but grain is becoming more expensive, corn, oilseed and the knock-on effects to wheat, palm oil and so on. So I think there are some things that are changing between now and August that everybody has to pay attention to. But it's in Canpotex's hands. They're negotiating.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Just a couple of follow-up questions on China and India. We've seen Chinese potash port inventories significantly increase in the last couple of weeks. Imports have been very strong in May and June, it seems. The first question would be what is your view here on inventory stock -- port stocks building? And could that possibly push out your August timeline for a settlement for Canpotex? And also in India, we've seen a lot of spot volume picked up by Chinese exporters, and we also saw PhosChem sort of half-year volumes on the contracts to your Indian customers for DAP lower year-over-year. What are your views on possibly losing some share in India this year? Or will you pick it up later?","James T. Prokopanko","Okay, Joel, good questions. I'm going to ask Rick, our commercial leader, Rick McLellan, to answer those questions.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, Joel, on Chinese potash inventory, we just see everybody shipping to meet their contracts. It's going to reflect -- their first half contracts, which is reflecting a bit of build in inventories at the ports. Nothing that we hadn't expected, and I think, as Jim said, a lot has to play out between now and August when we expect the deal to be closed. The second piece was the -- your question was on India. And on India, we continue to see them buy volumes out of China, little bits and pieces every week. There still isn't enough DAP going into India. We had -- we limited the amount of DAP we had in our first quarter, which you saw in our contract that we completed, and we focused on markets that provide us a little better return. And so longer term, we know that we're going to do less into India, and we're very comfortable and our customers were very comfortable in the program we put together this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. I believe you said in your prepared remarks that you're working on a feasibility study for an ammonia plant. Can you just walk us through the timeline for that process? And maybe just give us some color about what you're thinking about in terms of going forward with that or not once the feasibility study is complete.","James T. Prokopanko","Joc O'Rourke is leading our project, the ammonia expansion, the new plant and the expansion of current facilities, and he'll add an explanation of what our timeline looks like.","James C. O'Rourke","So Dan, in terms of the timeline, we are in the process of doing a detailed feasibility study at this point. It is quite a complex project. We are now analyzing not only the economics, but the technology, the permitting and the design options. As Larry said, we expect to have that decision towards the end of this calendar year for construction next calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jacob Bout, CIBC.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions on Esterhazy. So you gave some guidance here on the brine inflow costs and also the inflow rate, and it sounds like you're guiding to flat year-on-year inflow rates. What has been the trend over the past 3 to 4 years? And has something actually changed there? My impression was that the inflow rates have been gradually increasing, and then just a status on K3.","James T. Prokopanko","Jacob, we have been dealing with the brine at Esterhazy for about 30 years, and from time to time and over those 30 years, we do find different and emerging flow patterns. Some odd anomaly flows may come in at a -- from a different area than we might have previously experienced, and that's been the history over the 30 years. And the rates go up, and the rates go down. We've dealt with this -- we've dealt with it for 30 years successfully. We continue to deal with it, and we are very, very confident that we can deal with some of these new, we call them anomalies, there\u2019s some unexpected events. Every one has been dealt with. We've not lost, in those 30 years, a single day of production. We don't see the Esterhazy brine inflow as so much a matter of losing production, but one more of the cost issue with us. So we're -- as I say, in summary, we're confident that we will deal with whatever is dealt with us, and we've got 30 years of experience doing that. For the K3 mine expansion, Joc is leading that project, having some good success, as we said, on time and on budget. And Joc can add some details.","James C. O'Rourke","Jacob, the stage we're at right now, we've been working on the pre-sinking, the civil construction of the site itself. We have the freeze plans in place. We'll be moving into the freezing, and we'll be raising up the headframe this year in preparation for shaft-sinking starting in the next fiscal year, right on time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carroll with UBS.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It seems that the expectation for full production at South Fort Meade has slipped a couple months since the last update. So can you fill us in on the dynamics of restoring production there? And also, once operations are fully achieved there, what are your expectations for output at your other phosphate mines? Would you pull back some of the production at Wingate and Four Corners?","James T. Prokopanko","Bill, no, our plans at South Fort Meade are right on plan. We are getting the mine up to the production rates that we forecast, and it's on time and on schedule. And I'll ask Joc to talk about what our experiences have been at the other mines. I think we have made -- have commented that the other mines did step up in a material way to deal with the gap that was left by South Fort Meade being shut down. But Joc, how are we going to manage those mines going forward?","James C. O'Rourke","So going forward, Bill, the first priority for us is to rebuild the inventories that we drew down, the rock inventories that we drew down over the last year or 2. We are well on our way to doing that. South Fort Meade, as Jim said, is well on its way to be up to-- being up to full production again as we move draglines into the new Hardee County portion of that site. In the next year, once we get our inventories up, we will start moving more material to Louisiana to offset any of the purchased rock we've had in the past. So we'll still need high production rates from both Wingate and Four Corners. That may change in a year or 2, but up until then, we expect to run those operations just as hard as we are today.","James T. Prokopanko","And Joc, if I could just add just to be sure that while we're very much on schedule to be running at full rates by the end of this fiscal quarter at South Fort Meade, we won't start to see the full P&L impact of that until the second half of our fiscal year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with Lazard Capital Markets.","Edlain S. Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","A quick question on potash. Can you talk about what you're seeing in India in terms of when do you expect them to come online -- I mean, to sign a contract? Or is there a possibility that they could sit out for the full year? And also in Brazil, can you talk about what you've seen in terms of pricing? Because we've heard of what that $30 price increase -- that's out there. But are you seeing any implementation of that at all?","James T. Prokopanko","Edlain, it's Jim here. We are -- as far as India goes, we are not anticipating a contract for potash in India until September. It'll likely be post the Chinese resolution and September probably at the earliest. To your question, can they defer a year or take this year off or the balance of the year, yes, I think they -- if they choose to, they can hold off a year. But they're not going to avoid, they're just going to delay. And whatever they don't buy this year, I have little doubt that those potash purchases will have to be made some time shortly after that. Rick, do you want to add anything on the India, what's happening in country and then the Brazil questions on pricing?","Richard N. McLellan","I think, Jim, you've covered India, other than the fact to add that these local price increases because of the change in the currency are taking farmers some time to get used to. So that's why we expect not a robust return to demand there. But overall, we still expect the Indians to come in for a contract discussion in September. Now in Brazil, there's been several announced price increases of $30 a tonne. It's our belief that a portion of those have been -- a portion of that $30 has been captured. I think the Brazil market, as we went into the calendar year, carried through a significant amount of potash. That is getting used up with the marketplace as strong as it is. It's amazing the impact of beans in the teens will have on demand for crop nutrients, specifically phosphate and potash in Brazil. And so we've seen strong volume, and the price is continuing to edge up, rather than take a significant $30 price increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Picken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","Yes, just wanted to get your thoughts on the demand for phosphate down in Brazil. Again, you talked about the potash there, but any sort of update in terms of what we might expect? And I guess with the drought in the U.S., do you think we're going to end up seeing more Safrinha corn being planted? And what type of impact that might have on demand for both your products during this Safrinha season, during the winter?","James T. Prokopanko","Michael, Rick McLellan is the right person to answer that question.","Richard N. McLellan","It'll be -- yes, Michael, the kind of Brazilian demand and what gets planted. Right now, the economics for soybeans are extremely compelling in Brazil, and so this October's plantings, I think the expectation is, is that we will see more hectares planted of soybeans. Brazil has had a significant Safrinha this past -- that's just being harvested, and expectations are is some of that will come on the market. Phosphate demand, we think, is going to continue to be very strong into Brazil, and we look for good second half shipments to meet up for what the market will need. One of the things that the Brazilians are experiencing that is something they continue to need to focus on, this is a growing market, and vessels are waiting at main ports for up to 45 days. So I think we'll see a lull in new purchases of phosphate just to deal with the offloading of purchases that are coming in right now.","James T. Prokopanko","Okay, with that, we're going to close our call this morning. In closing, I'd like to summarize 3 key messages that I hope you leave with: first, external factors created some challenges for us and the rest of this industry this past year; second, Mosaic made important and significant progress in our fiscal 2012; and finally, prospects for our business this year and beyond are very, very positive. Mosaic is in an excellent position to achieve our vision of being recognized as the best crop nutrition company in the world. Everybody, have a great day.

Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our second quarter 2017 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion.","Mosaic delivered sequentially improved earnings for the quarter, as the business environment played out much as we expected it to. Mosaic earned $0.28 per share, including a $0.01 negative impact from notable items, on $1.75 billion in net sales.","We have three key messages for you today. First, our capital preservation and cost reduction efforts are yielding meaningful benefits. Second, we are making good progress as we plan for the integration of Vale Fertilizantes. And third, we are managing the business to capitalize on the long-term opportunity as potash and phosphate markets have stabilized and improve from 2016 lows. I'll provide some thoughts on these themes now, and then Rich will give you details on the quarter before my closing comments.","The market environment has improved. In Potash, published spot market prices today are up $40 to $50 per tonne from the lows in the third quarter of last year, while average phosphate stripping margins have increased $10 to $15 per tonne over that same period. As we expected, the market recovery has been gradual, and the cyclical trough has pressured our profitability and cash flow. We have taken far-reaching actions to adapt and to ensure Mosaic can compete across the cycle. In fact, a good portion of our revenue declines over the last several years have been offset by cost reductions and raw materials price declines.","We have achieved meaningful expense reductions. It is important to note that these are permanent reductions. We are not simply turning off the spending spigot for short-term gain. Our ability to lower capital spending is facilitated by substantial mechanical integrity efforts while maintaining operational reliability and safety. In fact, after substantial continued review, we have further lowered our CapEx guidance for 2018 and beyond by $50 million to approximately $750 million per year excluding Vale Fertilizantes.","As it relates to capital, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet and a healthy liquidity buffer. We also remain committed to taking the actions necessary to maintain investment-grade credit ratings. We are lowering costs, reducing brine management and capital expenditure requirements, and continually working to optimize our asset portfolio. One example of our continued asset optimization, last week we completed the sale of a significant vacant tract of land on the Mississippi River in Louisiana for $52 million.","When we issue debt to fund the cash portion of the pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition, our leverage ratios are expected to rise, and our subsequent priority will be to pay down debt and return to our through-cycle targeted balance sheet metrics. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Brazil. Upon closing the acquisition, we will add high-quality low-cost assets, and we expect to have a significantly amplified presence in the extremely promising Brazilian agricultural market.","Now I will turn the call over to Rich for his review of the quarter. Rich?","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all. This morning I'll briefly review our segment performance and guidance, and I will address some other factors that influenced our results for the quarter.","Starting with phosphates, shipment volumes and prices both came in near the top of our guidance ranges. Our phosphates gross margin rate at 8% was in the range of our updated guidance, taking into account the mechanical issue that occurred in March at our Faustina, Louisiana plant and the resulting impact on our cost of ammonia. The major turnaround at Faustina is completed. The final costs associated with the turnaround and ancillary startup issues are expected to have an immaterial impact on results for the third quarter and are included in our guidance.","During the quarter, MAP product premiums compressed against global benchmarks. Additionally, the North American market traded at a steep discount to global prices due to a high level of imports at New Orleans. While the MicroEssentials sales price relationships to MAP remain consistent, the decline in MAP prices negatively impacted expected MicroEssentials margins in the period. We expect this margin compression for both MAP and MicroEssentials to be transitory in nature. Going forward, we expect to continue to generate higher margins on sales of MicroEssentials and to capture an additional margin when we sell through our own distribution channel in Brazil.","I would like to point out a few other points of interest related to our phosphates business. First, the new ammonia vessel constructed for our use has been launched and is expected to begin regular trips across the Gulf of Mexico in the very near future. The vessel gives us logistics certainty and strategic flexibility, with deliveries of ammonia from CF Industries in Louisiana to a port near our operations in central Florida.","Our ammonia contract with CF is now in effect and expected to increase our ammonia costs in the fourth quarter. While the contract is under water at today's spot ammonia and natural gas prices, the contract was intended to provide us with shared producer economics, and we continue to see this contract as accomplishing that goal.","We have also increased our estimate of costs to repair the sinkhole at New Wales by $14 million because we determined that the void is larger than originally estimated. I want to note that the confining layer beneath the gyp stack has already been substantially sealed, and we are working to fill the remaining void to stabilize the existing plug.","For the third quarter, we expect phosphate shipment volumes to be in the range of 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes, and we expect prices to be in the range of $310 to $330 per tonne. In order to meet robust global demand, our operating rate is expected to remain high, in the mid-80% range. We expect the segment's margin rate to be in the range of 7% to 9%, primarily as a result of the temporary compression in MAP and MicroEssentials margins, as previously noted. We are also narrowing the full-year volume guidance from 9.5 million to 10.25 million tonnes to 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes for the year.","While we continue to expect that Chinese phosphate exports will be down this year compared with 2016, they remain a wildcard. Volumes are difficult to predict, but our estimate is that China will export around 9 million tonnes, down from 9.5 million tonnes last year and down from 11.6 million tonnes in 2015. Year to date, exports are up 26%, which we believe is driven by a combination of factors, including a poor domestic season, a jump in phosphate prices, and a desire to take what little cash margin is available before newly implemented export taxes and costs increase. Starting in 2018, we continue to expect that additional compliance costs related to the new environmental standards in China will put further pressure on Chinese phosphate exports.","Moving on to the potash segment, sales volumes and prices were in the middle of our guidance ranges, while our margin rate was slightly higher than guidance as a result of our ongoing cost control efforts. Market dynamics continue to strengthen, and the recent settling of a Canpotex contract with Chinese customers provided additional stability. While the contract price was at the low end of our expectations, it is good to have resolution because it helps demand emerge in other parts of the world.","In addition to driving costs out of our production operations, we are also reducing brine management costs as a result of investments we have made over the past several years. Our brine management processes are more efficient today, and we have been able to reduce spending as we look ahead to the K3 Esterhazy transition. We now expect full-year brine cost to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, down from prior guidance of $160 million to $180 million.","For the third quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes. We expect average realized prices to dip slightly to a range of $165 to $180 per tonne, primarily as a result of a shift in product mix as we recognize higher volumes of sales of standard-grade tonnes shipped to China.","We expect the segment's gross margin rate to be in the range of 15% to 18%, which reflects both the anticipated low 80% utilization rate and the stronger Canadian dollar. We expect to operate at lower rates in the fourth quarter after deferring some of the planned annual maintenance at our Esterhazy mine until October.","For the full year, we are narrowing our Canadian resource tax guidance to $90 million to $110 million from $85 million to $135 million, and we are also narrowing our full-year potash volume guidance to 8.1 million to 8.6 million tonnes, from 8.0 million to 8.75 million tonnes.","In the International Distribution segment, our volumes were within our guidance range, despite some deferred demand in Brazil. Our margins of $24 per tonne exceeded guidance as a result of a higher mix of our premium MicroEssentials products and price appreciation on inventories. For the third quarter, we expect international distribution volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, and we expect a margin to be in the low $20 per tonne range, assuming a Brazilian reais at current levels. Our full-year volume guidance is now 6.75 million to 7.25 million tonnes.","In the corporate segment, I want to note that the loss we recorded in the second quarter is primarily due to higher profit in inventory eliminations, which is largely the result of our own manufactured products sold to our distribution business to build up inventory in Brazil ahead of an anticipated strong third quarter. Profits are recognized in the manufacturing segment and eliminated in the corporate segment. Once that inventory is sold to a third party, we will recognize the profit in the corporate segment, so this is purely a matter of timing. As this inventory is being sold in the third quarter, we expect almost all of the negative adjustment to unwind and benefit consolidated gross margins. This swing reflects the normal seasonality in our business, combined with the fact that we only recognize revenue and profits when our products are sold to third parties.","Our tax guidance has also changed. We now expect our effective annual tax rate to be zero to slightly negative as a result of an increase in expected foreign earnings and a lower proportion of domestic earnings, as well as relatively constant depletion deductions. There is a high level of variability in our expected tax rate as a result of potential fluctuations in pre-tax earnings and mix of global income sources.","Before I conclude, I would like to note that we recorded $12 million in equity earnings from our Ma'aden Wa'ad Al-Shamal joint venture during the quarter. The earnings came in earlier than expected and resulted from strong sales of ammonia during a seasonally high period for ammonia prices. In addition, the Wa'ad Al-Shamal project has produced its first test tonnes of finished phosphate product, and we expect production to begin in earnest later this month. The project is likely to produce approximately 0.5 million tonnes of product later this year, with potential modest upside depending on how the ramp-up of the mega-project occurs.","To summarize, we remain focused on the things that we can control at Mosaic. We have driven major costs out of our system, and we are making prudent capital decisions so that we can succeed across the cycle and deliver shareholder value for the longer term.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Rich.","With all the challenges our industry has faced over the past few years and with companies' equity valuations at low levels, I can understand why many investors are less focused on the long term. But I think it is important to reiterate that we strongly believe that this industry will realize tremendous long-term value. Near-term, uncertainties remain, including trends in grain prices and new fertilizer capacity. New capacity comes to the market in big steps, and the capacity expansions we all started when markets were strong are bringing new tonnes when markets are softer.","But grower demand has persisted in a steady upward climb, despite tough farm and commodity economics. In fact, next year we expect another step up in global shipments for both potash and phosphates, with both nutrients achieving record shipments. That's driven by two factors that are not going to change. First, farmers have a strong incentive to maximize their yields and in turn, their revenue per acre, and balanced crop nutrition is required for higher yield. And second, the globe's demand for food will continue to increase. To put it simply, agriculture's increasing demand for crop nutrients will absorb the new supply over time.","Mosaic is in excellent position now, with our cost and capital controls delivering real benefits, and we are extremely well positioned to outperform when business dynamics strengthen. Our many moves over the past several years and our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition create tremendous earnings leverage and opportunity for our shareholders.","Finally, we received notice that CADE [Administrative Council for Economic Defense] has approved our acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes, subject to a 15-day appeal period. There are other closing conditions that have yet to be made, but we continue to believe we remain on track to close later in 2017.","With that, we will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up question on your Chinese export view, I believe the press release says it's important to your near-term outlook. So can you just help us understand how you expect, if their export reduction does take place as you anticipate, how that's going to flow through 3Q, 4Q, and into next year? I assume the impact is limited to your expectations for 3Q, but clarifying the walk into next year would be helpful.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Vincent, thanks for your question. And let me just start out by saying we expect, with the tax changes and whatnot that they're going to make in China that next year we will definitely see a decrease of those exports as their overall cost rises. But I'm going to let Corrine and Mike talk about the Q3 and Q4 impact, as we've seen slightly higher shipments so far this year, but that's been driven largely by a higher price and maybe a desire to get cash in the bank before these tax changes. So I'm going to let Corrine and Mike tag- team the rest of that. Corrine and Mike?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","All right, guys. Thanks, Joc. Let me give it the first shot. Just to reiterate what Rich said in the comments, year to date, exports are down 26%, about 800,000 tonnes \u2013 I'm sorry, they're up 800,000 tonnes. We expect that we'll end the year at about 9 million tonnes, which is down about 500,000 tonnes. So second half of the year we're expecting about 1.3 million fewer tonnes exported from China.","The reason for that is, one, we expect the domestic market to really kick in here over the next few weeks. The other factor is that I think there is increasing cost pressure in China. And we've seen an increase in sulfur prices. The Chinese producers do not necessarily have a competitive advantage in terms of sulfur prices or ammonia prices since they make most of their ammonia with coal, and coal prices have actually increased over the last six months.","And then I think the best evidence of that is there was an announcement this morning that the publications indicated that the Six Plus Two Group met. And surprisingly, they've taken their price floor up to $350 per tonne. And whether or not that holds remains to be seen, but I think it's really indicative of the fact that cost pressures exist and they're working to try to move prices up.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Mike. One of the other I think supportive factors for that announcement about the prices holding, the domestic price in the interior is up probably about $15 \u2013 $10 to $15 higher than what the export equivalent would be for those producers, and therefore, I think a reason why they'll either hold on those export prices or they'll be shipping to that domestic market for season.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And just let me close by saying on this one that China does remain probably the biggest wildcard in terms of the phosphate market in the next six months. We are well aware of what's going to happen with increased production from the North Africans and the Saudis. But we really \u2013 you can't predict unless we have a pretty good view of what happens in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just want to ask a little bit more about the phosphate margins. So obviously, the prices and premiums have had a negative impact, as you guided (21:03) in your prepared commentary. But you've also done some pretty good things on the operational side to help lower costs as well, so that should be helping the margin a bit. Just longer term, I know you probably won't be able to provide some more specific guidance. But just generally, could you help us walk us through the path or the timing in terms of getting back to maybe a mid-teens type of phosphate margin? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Andrew. I can probably hit most of this, and I'll just ask Mike to talk a little bit about the longer term. Look, the path to mid-teen margins really requires absorbing the new production that's going to come on in the next couple years. So there's probably 3 million to 5 million tonnes coming on, and we're absorbing that at a rate of almost 2 million tonnes a year, so in the next couple years there's going to be some absorption of those tonnes. But once you get past that, the market starts tightening up pretty well. And obviously, what the Chinese do matters. And if those tonnes go down, this could be a pretty tight market pretty quick, in which case we expect to return to more long-term mid-teen margins. Mike, do you have anything to add to that?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","I can just briefly add. Just in terms of the five-year supply and demand outlook, we do think demand prospects remain very strong. We expect that demand will grow in that 2% to 2.5% range per year. And then on the supply side, we've always said that there's not a lot of new capacity in the pipeline once you get beyond Morocco and Saudi Arabia. And in fact, CRU just published their quarterly report yesterday. And just looking at those numbers, they're showing about 3.5 million tonnes of new capacity coming on, all of that from \u2013 basically all of it from Saudi Arabia and Morocco. We expect \u2013 and that assumes that China makes very few changes in their phosphate industry, and it remains to be seen how all that plays out. So when you add up 2% \u2013 2.5% growth, once we get past this increase in capacity coming online here in the next year or so, and as Joc said, operating rates, we're projecting a 200 to 400 basis point increase in global operating rates, and that's not inconsistent with what the current CRU forecasts are.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Now the other piece of that that you implied at least is the premiums have been compressed for both MAP and MicroEssentials in the last little while. Let me let Corrine address that issue.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. We have seen a compression in MAP and the premium products price premium. This has largely been a factor of MAP premium globally being depressed because of the large level of exports that we've seen. We have put that into our guidance, but we commented in the prepared remarks that we believe this is transitory. We are starting to see some correction, not back to normal levels or anything yet, but we are starting to see a little bit of correction and a promising sign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. I understand this may include a few smaller assets not included in the transaction. But as Vale has now reported a breakeven EBITDA and negative cash flow for deferred assets in the first half, what's your general assessment of the economic viability of these assets given the current pricing environment? And how quickly do you believe you can extract synergies or let's say op efficiency improvements from the portfolio for the intermediate term, as you have done on your own assets? So just overall, do you believe your team will be able to dramatically improve the op efficiencies? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Chris, thanks for your question. Let me start by just saying look, first of all, we can't comment a whole lot on their results on the basis of that's a separate public company. And up until basically this morning, from my comment, we had not got antitrust approval. So we're not going to make a whole lot of comments about that. But I will also say this is a long-term investment. We're not looking at this over what's going on today. I'm going to hand it over to Rich to talk a little bit about the economic performance and how it's maybe changed from what our model was when we first bought the business or committed.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, thanks, Joc, and good morning, Chris, nice to hear from you. A couple of things I would say on Vale Fertilizantes is first of all, strategically I think this is in the center of the play for Mosaic. It's a very important transaction for us. It gives us a very significant interest in the Americas, North and South America. It has lots of interconnectivity with our phosphate operations globally. And so we view this to be certainly a very strategic transaction that otherwise probably wouldn't have been available had we not taken advantage of the opportunity to enter into this agreement with Vale.","The second thing I would say is, if you take a look at the historical financial performance of this business, it's been very volatile, up and down. There are years where it significantly outperforms, and there are years where it can underperform, and I think 2017 is one of those years.","You referenced a financial metric which I'm not sure that I can verify concretely on the call here, but what I can say is there were a number of things that Vale needs to do before we close this transaction, which is likely expenditures of cash that they probably weren't otherwise planning for.","And secondly, you have seen a near-record strengthening of the Brazilian reais, at least in the last two or three years. If you go back 12 months, the reais was at BRL 3.8 \u2013 BRL 3.9, pushing BRL 4 to a dollar, and here we are today at BRL 3.1. And so that movement has got significant implication for the financial performance for Vale. And long term, if you take a look at what the prognostications are and what the fiscal condition is of Brazil, I think that I would take the bet that the reais likely is going to weaken, which should improve the financial performance for that business.","And then finally on synergies, what I would say is this. We've communicated $95 million in operational and tax-related synergies on an annual basis. We have been hard at it planning the integration activities. We have got a list of synergy opportunities that go on for many, many pages, and we are going to be driving that synergy capture very aggressively once we close this transaction. And so I think that we've got a high degree of confidence that we're going to be able to not only deliver on what we communicated publicly but hopefully some good upside to that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please go ahead.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. We haven't heard much on the potash antitrust review for Agrium and PotashCorp. Are you expecting any changes to the industry structure as a result of that review?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","We obviously aren't privy to their antitrust. Sorry, John, welcome. Sorry, just to start out, we're really not privy to the Agrium potash antitrust review. Obviously, as a major player in the same industry, we will be interviewed by the FTC and whatnot. But in terms of industry structure, one has to assume that they'll put the deal together, and it will mean Agrium will be a bigger potash producer, a bigger nitrogen producer, and I guess a somewhat bigger phosphate producer at some point. But industry structure, we really can't make much more comment than that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning, Jonas.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm going to go back to phosphates for a bit, if you don't mind. So the Chinese price seems to have stabilized at a cash cost floor, as you talked about. But in the West, it still keeps deteriorating. So can you talk a little bit about what's going on, why that disconnect, and how do you see that evolving?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. I'm going to just hand that straight to Corrine and Mike. They're watching the S&D pretty closely. I assume when you say the West is deteriorating, you're talking about North America and Brazil down slightly. Is that the question, Jonas? Okay, well that's what I'm going to answer. You seem to be \u2013 maybe you got cut off already.","Anyway, so first of all, let me say I'm going to hand it straight over to Corrine. But let me say first of all, although prices are flat to slightly declining, we've seen very big decreases in ammonia price. So our margins are staying relatively constant and even improving a little bit. But Corrine, do you want to just talk a little bit about the Western?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, Joc. I was going to comment about margin improvement overall. And usually, when we see this kind of move in ammonia prices, you'll see a little bit of an impact. It's also, remember, our fill seasonal time period, so we've been through spring season peak season, we've got fall ahead of us. This is the summer fill time period, and so you do see prices publish down usually during that time period, just a normal seasonal pattern.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","The only thing I would add, Jonas, is that putting some numbers behind what Joc said, just as late as April, we were paying $340 for ammonia. This month, we're paying $190, so that's a $150 drop in ammonia prices, and that's the equivalent of a $35 drop in the cost of raw materials. And certainly prices have softened, but they have not come down nearly that much. So we'd like to think in terms of what we call the stripping margin. And as Joc said, that has not eroded as much and frankly, has remained fairly stable, in a range of around $2.25 to $2.50, and we're at the upper end of that range in terms of a benchmark today.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","And in terms of those prices, Jonas, you are seeing NOLA stepping back up. So you've got NOLA prices in that $320 \u2013 $325 range, which is a recovery really from the low point that we had at the very end of the disappointing season, or the very start of the fill. So NOLA is trending up. It's Brazil that's the softest really now.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Can we go to the next question please, operator?","Operator","Yes, your next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, a couple questions on potash. Can you just talk about how successful the domestic summer fill program was and whether you've tested the mid-July $20 price increase? And how does that \u2013 what's the context in terms of channel inventories in the U.S. ahead of the Bethune startup?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Don. I will hand this one straight to Corrine again. She's right on top of it, so let me give it straight to you, Corrine.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. We went out with our fill programs and had a tremendous amount of success on those fill programs, indicating to us that we probably saw lower ending inventory than was expected. With the disappointing spring, there was questions about whether or not we got those channel inventories emptied. It appears as if they got pretty empty because we had a big fill program, and we are effectively sold out for Q3. We have not seen a lot of trade yet at the up $20, but we also see no indication that that price won't hold. It's just a matter of, they've just finished their fill orders. We'll get a chance to test it soon, I'm sure.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, again, Don. Next question, operator, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson of Scotia Bank. Please go ahead.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","It's Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. OCP announced an intention to capture 50% of incremental finished phosphate demand over the next decade. So how does that play into your own long-term strategy from a market share perspective? And, assuming that you want to maintain market share long term, where do you think about adding capacity?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yes, thanks, Oliver. Let me start by just saying yes, OCP has been quite forward about saying they're going to capture 50% of that demand. But if you look on a 10-year time horizon, we're going to need a lot of new phosphate capacity, and that phosphate capacity, frankly, is going to come from probably North Africa and the Saudis. So we fully expect that they will need to, to keep the market balanced, at least do 50% of that world market share. And we expect \u2013 look, over time, our Florida operations are not going to get bigger. We've invested in Vale in Brazil and we've invested in Ma'aden, which will bring up our production levels.","But overall, over a 10-year time horizon, we would fully expect that we will probably lose market share to OCP, and they'll be, at some point, the dominant player, as the dominant player in this business. And then of course, Ma'aden will be the other one that will be, if not as big as us, probably close on our tail. So we, we're fully expecting that in how we see the industry playing out. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much, good morning.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Your ammonia costs per tonne in phosphate went up sequentially from $285 a tonne to $373. Can you discuss what's behind that? And secondly, China potash prices year over year have gone from $219 to $230 a tonne. Do you get an $11 a tonne improve netback, or because of freight increases, the netbacks are the same or lower?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, let me take those sequentially. First, ammonia costs, the Q2 ammonia costs are highly affected by what was a three-year turnaround of our ammonia plant in Faustina, and I assume that's the main driver of that.","As you know, the purchased ammonia, and just to give you a little background, we're making about 400,000 of let's say 1.6 million tonnes of ammonia that we buy a year, so we're making about 25% of that ourselves. When we get the CF Industries contract, that will be another let's call it 500,000 metric tonnes. And so we'll still be buying a number of tonnes on the open market, which has definitely gone down. In Q1 we had some issues, which you know drove ammonia prices up and the ammonia prices were significantly higher, and those are still flowing through into the books in Q2. So all of those things have an impact.","In terms of China netbacks for potash, and we'll talk about this a little bit. I'll let Corrine talk about it a little bit. But in general, we've said I think the way to look at that $11 rise is not that it's a great improvement in terms of our netback in our Saskatchewan operations, but more of a benchmark that allows the market to start flowing. Do you want to talk a little bit about potash?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. That $11 increase, there were a lot of reports, as you say, about freight changes eating up some of that difference. I think it's important to note, and we have talked about this before, that Canpotex has long-term freight agreements that have been locked in, and so there is no change in the Canpotex freight expense, and so this is an $11 netback increase on this China sale for the potash sales.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Good morning, everyone, maybe a question on Brazil, both potash and phosphate actually. If I look at first half imports for both P and K, they're up significantly. Shipments from the distributors, including yourselves, are more flattish, and you've actually tempered your own International Distribution volumes for the full year. Can you talk about the inventory position in the channel as you see it today in Brazil? Can you talk about import expectations in the back half of the year given somewhat weaker farmer economics on soy and sugar? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Adam. I'm going to hand most of this over to Mike. But just let me say you're right. Our imports are up significantly into Brazil, and we're predicting the market goes from 34 million tonnes of total fertilizer original guidance down to probably about 34 million tonnes of guidance is where we're guiding the total market to. So it's slightly less than what we had planned for this year, but we're still looking at a very strong main growing season or main usage season coming up. And we have put inventory in place to be ready for that, and we're expecting a strong season coming up.","And this is also \u2013 if you look at what we call profit in inventory, profit in inventory is actually quite high right now in the second quarter, and that will reverse and drive profit in the third quarter as those sales go to third parties. In terms of the overall S&D in Brazil, Mike, do you just want to make a couple comments?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. As Joc said, we expect total shipments to be about flat with last year at around 34 million tonnes, maybe up a whisker. But I think what's important, first six months of the year shipments were 13 million tonnes, flat with a year ago. So you've got about one-third of those shipments coming in the first half of the year, about two-thirds second half of the year. So you've got the big season still ahead of us. And I think as we've indicated before, farmers in Brazil have held back in terms of grain sales and fertilizer purchases. So there has been an increase in inventories, but that has been a buildup in anticipation of a very strong second half pull.","Just in terms of if you want some specific numbers, we expect that \u2013 if you look at imports during the first six months of the year, DAP, MAP, TSP, they're up about 29%. We expect that for the year, imports will total 6.3 million tonnes versus a year ago of 5.6 million, so that's about a 13% increase. So we see very, very strong imports second half of the year, about 3.5 million tonnes versus 3.4 million last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO. Please go ahead.","Milan Hemendra Shah - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi, this is Milan on for Joel. Just going to go back to the Chinese phosphate exports, a lot of the talk in the first half of the year was around potential plant shutdowns due to environmental checks surrounding gypsum stock waste and concerns around that. Are you seeing any on that? Any color on that would be helpful. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, thanks. Yes, certainly we expect that the environmental audits will start driving some of the plants to shut down. And the better plants \u2013 we've always said there's a fair bit of excess capacity in China, and we expect some of the higher-cost higher-polluting plants to end up ultimately being shut down. And we would see that over time you're going to end up with a smaller but stronger Chinese industry. And so, Corrine, do you want to talk a little bit about what we're seeing from those environmental audits already?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. So remember, earlier this year, what we talked about was environmental audits that were occurring. And those audits were designed to evaluate the situation in each plant in order to determine if there are further actions and steps that could lead to closure. So not that we expected a lot of closures in Q1 when these audits started, but that they set a baseline. From that point, what we are seeing is an environmental tax that will kick in at the beginning of next year, which raises the cost curve for the Chinese producers, we believe somewhere in that $10 to $15 a tonne of product range.","And secondly, you may see some shutdowns due to some environmental concerns, things like gyp stacks. However, this consolidation in the Chinese industry that we've been talking about is something that we expect to see after these taxes all kick in. At this point; we believe there's about 1 million tonnes of production that is shut down due to environmental issues, a relatively small amount of restructuring in a 27 million tonne production business. Restructuring also is expected given the debt levels at some of these producers as we go into next year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. What changes are you expecting in your potash shipments in 2018, particularly geographically, if your Canpotex allocation is lower. And assuming PotashCorp-Agrium come together and the K+S legacy mine is fully onstream, how does that change the end markets that you will be reaching next year?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, first let me address the Canpotex changes because I think that's important. First of all, yes, there's no question, I think Rocanville now has had its full credit to Canpotex, but offsetting that and missed a lot is we had over 1 million tonnes of credit to our piece of Canpotex. So net-net, on a 35 million tonne Canpotex total capacity between the three players, Agrium has gone down and Mosaic has gone down by about that 2 million tonnes net that PotashCorp has added. So although PotashCorp added 3 million, we offset that by 1 million, so we don't go down that much in Canpotex. Canpotex we expect will probably grow with the market next year, and that will allow us to probably stay relatively flat in that despite going down slightly on our thing.","In terms of nutrient, I don't think that affects the market shares if you just add the MOP at all. Legacy, obviously we're going to have to find \u2013 people are going to have to find a way to deal with legacy, and we'll deal with that as it comes. We've got market strategies, but those are to be looked at as we build those up.","Mike, do you want to talk about the overall S&D in that and how it gets affected regionally?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, we laid that out. I think we have our potash shipments by destination as one of the slides in the appendix, so you can see the numbers there. We're projecting about a 2.1 million tonne increase this year to 62.8 million. That's a 3.5% increase from 60.7 million in 2016. We've said all along that after two years of declining shipments due to the big buildup of pipeline inventories in 2014 that we expected a good rebound this year, and that is taking place. In 2018, we expect that we'll be up again. We're projecting about 64.5 million tonnes of shipments in 2018.","And in terms of where that's coming from, no surprise, it's the big six where we see continued growth, helped by some of the newer regions, good rebound or decent growth in places like Africa, the former Soviet Union. But it will be the Brazils, the Indonesias, Malaysias of the world that account for most of that.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And Steve, if you look at our predictions for next year, we're looking at 63.5 million to 65.5 million tonnes global shipments next year. You compare that to 2016 at 60.7 million tonnes, we have more than absorbed any capacity increases that would come from legacy at 1.8 million tonnes. We're at 4 million tonnes of growth. And the only new capacity coming on is 1.8 million tonnes. So clearly on that, the market will be tighter next year than it actually was in 2016.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","That's particularly true, Joc, in the context that there's been about 3 million tonnes of capacity that's been permanently closed in North America. Now some of that has been offset by the Rocanville and belt line (48:15) expansion. But we're at very little net increase in capacity in North America. And the industry now is structured such that we're achieving a much lower per-unit cost as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi. Please go ahead.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, thank you. With the new GST structure in India for taxes, how do you expect that will impact potash demand in India, which I think you expected to grow 43% over the next five years at your Analyst Day back in April? Do you think the new tax structure is supportive of that?","And then secondly, I think you mentioned on legacy mine, like K+S, do you think, when they start up that mine, initially they sell a lot more tonnes in the domestic market? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","I'm going to do these in reverse order here, P.J., because Mike's going to answer the first question on GST, maybe with a little bit from Corrine on that.","Let me talk about legacy startup. What we do know there, and I think it's public information, is that they are starting out making standard-grade potash, which will be shipped through their port in Port Moody or whatever in Vancouver ,basically. So all their early production is going to go to the international market, because they do not have granulation capacity yet built. Next year they will start building granulation capacity. And you may be aware, they have a deal with Koch Industries to sell some 400,000 tonnes in the domestic market.","So we would expect that they will have a presence in the domestic market sometime next year, and I assume they will have a presence in the industrial market. But a good chunk of it will be sent internationally, and they've said publicly, some of it will be to offset production declines in some of their German operations. But again, those are more for K+S to answer than us. Mike, do you just want to talk a little bit about the GST and the impact on demand in India?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, sure, happy to do that. I would note that K+S produced their first tonne on June 12 and the world didn't come to an end. I think we should note that.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","That's good news, Mike.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","And in terms of India, I think the important point there is that the GST was reduced for fertilizer imports to 5%. And when you combine that with lower subsidy, their $230 import price, import economics continue to work there. Our team in India believes that India will import about 4.4 million tonnes of potash this year, up about 0.5 million tonnes from last year. You can see that our 2018 forecast range is 4.4 million to 4.6 million tonnes. And I think that the 4.4 million tonne forecast for this year assumes that we'll have a small increase in retail prices, given a strong rupee, lower potash prices, or relatively low potash prices, 5% GST. Import economics and farm economics work with a very small increase in retail prices. So there's nothing in terms of policy changes that really concern us about the long-term prospects for potash demand in India.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken of Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about your growth targets for MicroEssentials from a volume perspective. Does the current \u2013 I know you called it a transitory situation with MAP and MicroEssentials premiums shrinking \u2013 change your growth production plans at all, and what type of volume can we expect out of South America specifically over the next couple years?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Let me start by saying, as you guys are likely all aware, we increased our capacity to produce MicroEssentials when we built the new capacity at New Wales. That takes our capacity up to, let's say, 3.5 million tonnes of total capacity. Now we expect to grow into that capacity over the next couple of years, so we will see continued growth.","In terms of the price relationship, that relationship to MAP has held. There's a number of issues, and I'll let Corrine talk a little bit about how that margin has squeezed in this quarter. So we don't see that price relationship changing, and so we still see the growth expectations for MicroEssentials. Corrine?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. The capacity numbers, I think Joc has put in perspective. And the demand growth, at our Analyst Day we talked about a growth by 2021 of volume being up 25% since 2013, to a point where the mix is about one-third premium products for our phosphate business overall, for the growth.","And in terms of the pricing, Joc is correct. The differential pricing for these premium products relative to MAP is unchanged. What we are seeing is MAP compression from the heavy level of imports into the United States on MAP. And so that compression has impacted MicroEssentials pricing. We do believe this is transitory. We know that the agronomic value is there for these products, and they are capturing a premium relative to MAP. And as we see the MAP differential to DAP recovering to more normal levels, which we are starting to see a little bit recovery, we believe we'll be back to earning back \u2013 seeing the premium flow through.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Next question operator, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Lungo of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Daniel Lungo - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Just on the balance sheet, Moody's recently put you guys on review for downgrade. I'm just wondering what the conversations have been with them. They stated that a downgrade would only be one notch, but there's still the possibility for a negative outlook after that. So what have you been saying to them? What are they looking for from you? They're expecting to put something out this week, I know, but what type of steps are you willing to do to defend that investment-grade rating, just any comments on that?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, Dan. Let me start by saying you recognize we have a split rating where Moody's does rate us one notch higher than S&P. And so they are putting us on notice. But I'm going to let Rich Mack talk about our capital strategy and what we're doing there and any conversation he can give you there. Thanks.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, Dan. I think it's a fair question. As Joc noted, we do have a split rating with S&P and Moody's. And so the fact that Moody's has put us under review for a potential one notch downgrade to what would match S&P is not particularly surprising, I guess point number one.","We're in very close communications and have been for a long time. Several times a year we'll meet with all of the rating agencies and keep them posted on what's happening with our business. One of the pillars that we have communicated is our intent of maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating, and that still holds. And so I think you need to view this through the lens of a cyclical company. There are going to be times when you're stretched and you're outside of what your targeted leverage ratios are.","So what we're focused on are the levers that we can control, our costs, our SG&A, our capital. And you heard earlier in our prepared remarks, we've revised downward a number of things. CRT is coming down. Our brine expenditures for the year is coming down. We've lowered our CapEx. Our tax rate is either flat to negative for the year. Our operating costs I think have demonstrated over the past couple of years that we have taken significant costs out of the system. We've restructured the company, and our SG&A is at levels that are very different than where they were at two or three years ago. And so there are number of levers that we have that we continue to look at and manage the performance of that will help us achieve the objectives that I just stated.","Additionally, periodically there are opportunities to generate cash on miscellaneous asset sales. I think you saw or heard earlier that in the quarter we sold a basically unused parcel of land for in excess of $50 million. So things like that help.","And then finally, in the end, it also ties into ultimately what our forecasts are, which we routinely are revising our forecasts and what our outlooks look like based on the global S&D, farmer economics, and ultimately how that also interconnects with our dividend policy. And so we have a number of levers to pull at Mosaic to maintain our investment-grade status. That's what we intend to do.","And then the final thing that I would point out for you is the ample liquidity buffer that we have, $2.5 billion. I think we ended the quarter with nearly $700 million of cash on balance sheet and a $2 billion revolver. And so I hope that's responsive to your question.","James C.

Mosaic delivered another solid quarter despite significantly lower phosphate prices and operating rates driven by weather conditions in North America as well as regulatory changes in Brazil.","Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to execute at a very high level across the company, which is reflected in well-controlled operating costs and continued increases in synergy realization at Mosaic Fertilizantes.","Our results demonstrate the economic value of the much more efficient business that we have created. Before we get into the results for the quarter, I would like to provide you with an update on the situation in Brazil, where the new regulation governing mine tailings dam is having an impact on our operations.","Since the Vale dam failure, Brumadinho, in January we have been working with our external consultants and the Brazilian regulators to ensure our own dams remain safe to operate and meet the newly implemented standards. In March, we recognized that our dam at Araxa did not meet the new requirement and idled that mine. In-mid April we were unable to complete geo technical assessments at an additional three dams resulting in the idling of our Tapira and Catalao mines.","Now that the assessments are complete, we have a much better understanding of the timing and implications related to idling of these mines. At Catalao we expect to be fully operational in the second quarter. At Tapira, we expect to return to full operation in the third quarter.","At Araxa, we are on track to begin operations in the third quarter. While these mines are idled, we expect to meet our Brazilian customers fertilizer needs with a combination of existing rock and production inventory in Brazil, rock from our mine in Peru and MAP from Florida.","For the year we expect to incur higher rock costs from importing rock from our Peru mine primarily from higher transportation costs and additional cost from under utilization at the mines and chemical plants. Combined we expect these incremental costs could total up to $100 million.","We are continuing to look for ways to further mitigate these higher costs. We also expect some positive offsets, for example, higher operating rates at our lower cost Florida assets should lead to stronger margins. We anticipate the work to bring all dams into compliance and remediate the remaining upstream list will be accomplished within our existing capital budget over the next three years.","Our ability to use Miski Mayo rock in our global production demonstrates the strategic and risk management benefits of owning three quarters of this mine. In addition, we expect that these incremental shipments may allow the mine to operate at higher rates, driving lower cost per tonne.","Shipping MAP from Florida to Brazil will allow us to consume built-up us inventory more quickly. Going into North American spring season both Mosaic\u2019s and channel inventories were high due to the weak 2018 fall application season and the late and wet 2019 spring. Reducing our own inventories while the spring season is depleting channel inventories should result in a tightening of supply.","To summarize our efforts related to dams in Brazil. We have a well defined plan to resolve the issue. We are taking action and making good progress towards resolution. We are meeting our customer needs and we'll continue to do so reflecting the benefit of our global asset footprint and combination of distribution and production.","And finally, we believe that in the end Mosaic will have a lower risk profile and remain in an excellent position to serve resilient agricultural markets for generations to come.","Now let's move on to the quarter results. We provided substantial updates on our progress at our Analyst Day at the end of March. So, we will keep our remarks brief. For the quarter, Mosaic reported earnings of $131 million, up from $42 million last year, both on revenues of $1.9 billion.","The company generated $430 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $399 million of adjusted EBITDA a year ago and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 compared with $0.20 a year ago. The improvement in operating margin despite a lower phosphate stripping margin and the impact of curtailments reflects the underlying improvements we've made in our cost structure.","Based on our actual results for the first quarter and our outlook, we are revising our full year EBITDA guidance to $2 billion to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. This reflects the impact of the regulation change in Brazil, but also acknowledges the impact of higher Canadian resource taxes and slower phosphate pricing recovery than originally anticipated.","Moving on to the business environment, markets for our two nutrients diverged during the first quarter. As I said earlier, phosphate prices fell primarily as a result of high carryover inventories in North America and high and early seasonal imports into New Orleans.","In addition, Chinese exports in the first quarter increased by over 0.5 million tonnes from a year ago adding to global market length while lower raw material prices helped, market stripping margins still declined over 20% year-over-year.","North American demand began to emerge at the quarters end and prices have stabilized. In fact, prices have actually increased for product that is upcountry in the U.S. where high Mississippi River water levels have created logistic challenges.","Mosaic has a strong geographic competitive advantage in the U.S. over importers. At the end of the quarter, over 40% of our phosphate inventory was in upcountry facility of St. Louis in Mosaic\u2019s or our customers warehouses, which gives us the ability to get product where it needs to be regardless of river shipping conditions.","This also highlights why we recently purchased a very large distribution facility called Pine Bend near the north end of the Mississippi River in Minnesota. The facility significantly improves our ability to serve Midwest customers and reduces our logistics risks.","In addition, we're finally seeing seasonal demand in China emerge which is focusing Chinese production on domestic demand. On the other side of the world fertilizer demand in Brazil is running ahead of last year with very strong shipment growth in both phosphates and potash.","In contrast to the phosphate market potash was much less impacted by the logistic challenges in the Mississippi River region. And the potash supply and demand picture remained balanced during the quarter with prices holding relatively flat.","Our curtailments in the quarter were driven by logistics issues internationally and full warehouses domestically. Those issues are now resolved and we expect inventory to flow out in the second quarter with much less logistical friction.","In addition, we continue to expect constructive market fundamentals for potash through at least 2020. We acknowledged that there are risks to our outlook including whether such as the El Nino related drought that may impact potash demand in Southeast Asia and palm oil demand uncertainty, in phosphates the Chinese supply and demand picture continues to search for a new normal.","The continued strength of demand in our markets combined with our strong execution gives us confidence that we can weather the short-term challenges and come out even stronger in the end.","Now Clint will discuss the segments in more detail including our expectations for the second quarter. Flint?","Clint Freeland","Thanks Joc. Good morning everyone. I'll start by reiterating Joc's message regarding the first quarter. Our business performed well as a result of excellent execution across the business units, and we delivered results in line with our expectations despite the weather and regulatory factors Joc discussed. Our Potash business generated another strong quarter with shipments in gross margin per tonne coming at the high end of our expectations.","Our cash costs of managing brine inflow declined to $28 million in the quarter and overall costs remained well controlled. We curtailed production at our Canadian mines during the quarter due to high inventory levels at the plants, which resulted from severe winter weather and slow rail service. As a result, our operating rate declined to 86%, which not only let us to recording approximately $11 million in idle plant costs during the first quarter, but also having higher cost production roll into inventory, which will be realized during the second quarter.","Last year, we changed our revenue recognition policy and there's now a longer lag between Canpotex shipment and revenue recognition. Fewer tonnes leaving the mines in the first quarter will negatively impact Canpotex volumes, but we expect this to be offset by strong domestic sales during the quarter.","With these dynamics in mind, our expectations for the second quarter are for sales volumes of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes and adjusted gross margin per tonne in the range of $70 to $80. As previously disclosed, we expect our cost of doing business in Canada to increase from where they have been in the past. As a result of higher taxes, we expect the Saskatchewan resource tax increase to raise our cost of goods sold by approximately $35 million in 2019 and by roughly $50 million per year thereafter.","Our phosphates results for the quarter reflected the deeper-than-usual seasonal price reductions and a continued delay in price recovery. While we recognize sales of 1.8 million tonnes, which was near the top end of our guidance range, we ended the quarter with over 1.3 million tonnes of finished product inventory. We expect to liquidate this inventory as we meet our North American and Brazilian customer needs, which should allow us to maintain high operating rates and low conversion costs.","We earned adjusted gross margin per tonne of $36 during the first quarter, slightly below our expectations due to lower market prices and the impact of higher cost associated with the accelerated maintenance work done in the quarter. We announced this shift to curtail production by 300,000 tonnes during the quarter because of temporary market conditions. Similar to the fourth quarter of last year, rock costs during the period were somewhat elevated as we transition to new mining areas. This is short-term, however and does not change any of the longer term targets that we outlined at our Analyst Day.","Cash conversion costs continue to be well managed. During the second quarter, we expect to sell 2.3 to 2.6 million tonnes of finished product reflecting strong North American and Brazilian seasonal demand. Our gross margin per tonne expectation is $40 to $50 and includes the impact of the higher rock cost I mentioned running through inventory.","Recent ammonia and sulfur price declines are expected to flow through cost of goods sold likely in the third quarter. Our MicroEssentials products continued to perform well during the quarter with gross margin premiums of $62 per tonne over MAP. We expect this to remain in the $40 to $50 per tonne range for the year. In Brazil, fertilizer demand remains robust. Gross margin per tonne in the first quarter was lower than expected due to the cost of idling Araxa and other costs related to the new regulations.","Mosaic Fertilizantes realized net synergies of $66 million ahead of the $47 million that we shared during our Analyst Day presentation. All-in-all, business fundamentals, production, sales and synergy capture remained very strong in the quarter. Even with the current challenges, we believe that we will achieve our targeted net synergies of $275 million in 2019.","As Joc noted earlier, we expect it to incur up to $100 million in incremental costs during 2019, as we managed through the dam issue in Brazil. As part of our mitigation plan, we intend to import up to 120,000 tonnes of Miski Mayo rock monthly at an incremental logistics cost of $60 per tonne of rock. This covers about 40% of our total monthly rock used at the Brazilian plants. In over six months, this would add about $40 million to our costs in 2019.","Even with imported rock and existing rock inventories, we still expect to operate our chemical plants below full capacity resulting in higher period cost and cost per tonne of finished product. And finally, we plan to import up to 300,000 tonnes of finished product from Florida. However, I would note that the lower cost of production in Florida offsets a meaningful portion of the incremental transportation costs.","Taken together, these items are expected to increase the segment\u2019s operating costs by up to $100 million in 2019, approximately $50 million in the second quarter alone. For the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2 million to 2.3 million tonnes in line with normal expectations. As part of our plan to meet our customer needs, we've already begun to modify our current contracts to be optional origin, which allows us to source product from any of our global facilities, be it from North America, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia to serve our customers.","Gross margin per tonne is expected to be within range of $15 to $25, reflecting the impact of the higher costs that I mentioned, partially offset by distribution margins on the imported tonnes. At our recent Analyst Day, we outlined 2021 targets for each of our business units and we will continue to mark our progress toward them. This slide shows the four quarter rolling average as of the first quarter. Averages are meant to smooth out seasonality and the impact of turnarounds.","In addition, we've provided you our starting point, the 2018 actuals. While we work through the regulatory changes in Brazil, we do not expect to be making progress on the Mosaic Fertilizantes targets. The only other metric that is pressured near-term is the cash cost of rock and phosphates where we've had a couple of quarters of higher costs as we transition to new mining areas.","As we've discussed in the past, our business is seasonal, which means our working capital and cash flow is as well. The first quarter of each year tends to see the greatest use of working capital as inventory builds for spring application season and certain accruals from the previous year are extinguished.","This year was no different, as inventories rose by approximately $300 million and almost $200 million in payables related to Canadian taxes and G&A accruals were paid. As we move forward in the year, however, we would expect working capital to return to more normal levels.","As noted earlier, we're updating our guidance ranges for the year as a result of incremental cost in Brazil, higher tax burden in Canada and slower than expected phosphate recovery. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share is now $1.50 to $2, reflecting an expected increase in the effective tax rate.","Regarding cash usage, there are a handful of items to note. First, cash tax estimates have increased by almost $15 million on higher Canadian earnings and withholding. Cash interest expense estimates are up $10 million, due to a combination of lower cash balances and higher working capital financing cost in Brazil.","And finally, we've allocated $55 million during the quarter to the acquisition of the Pine Bend Warehouse, which financially generates an after tax unlevered return in the mid-teens and strategically positions us to better serve our customers by having increased Midwest warehousing capacity.","This acquisition lowers our logistics risk and allows us to take advantage of time and place premiums like we're seeing today. This acquisition also allowed us to avoid significant future CapEx spend at our Savage facility. Based on these factors, we expect capital available for allocation to be in the range of $400 million to $700 million for the year.","Now I'll turn the call back to Joc for his closing comments.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thank you, Clint. Several factors have our close attention. We will continue to monitor the evolving North American spring season. We will continue our work to meet new dam compliance requirements in Brazil. And as always, we will be monitoring Chinese phosphate exports. In addition, we are required to make a decision on the future of Plant City during the second quarter.","Regardless of the external challenges, Mosaic is in excellent position to generate strong returns. As our first quarter results demonstrate, we have made major progress and Mosaic today is a stronger and more resilient company than it has ever been before. We will keep pushing for lower costs and greater operating efficiencies, while driving excellent safety performance and maintaining the integrity of our assets. We are optimistic regarding the markets and we're confident that Mosaic will deliver robust value for all our stakeholders across the business cycle.","With that, I will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens Inc. Your line is now open.","Mark Connelly","Two things, if we look past the dam issues, you had talked about a $70 transportation cost for imports into Mato Grosso and at the time those assets weren't \u2013 still weren't competitive despite having that advantage. If we looked past the dam cost, do you have a sense of where you think you're on track to be? Are you going to fully offset that and \u2013 or is that, are you going to be sort of somewhere in the middle?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Mark, if I understand your question \u2013 sorry. Good morning. If I understand your question correctly, the suggestion is that even with the $70 transport costs, we are in the middle of the cost curve. I believe that's kind of what you're asking. And what I would say to that is two things, clearly because we are in the market, we do get the market premiums because of the time and place utility. And our synergies are absolutely moving us down the cost curve and making us much more competitive in that Mato Grosso market. So the $70 definitely is an advantage to us and one that we're I think capturing quite effectively in that business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Andrew Wong","Hi, good morning. Just regarding the revised earnings guidance for 2019, can you provide some more detail on the fertilizer prices and margins that are being run through those figures? Is that guidance maybe based on spot pricing margins or maybe some improvements for later this year? Thank you.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Let me hand this to Karen to give you a little bit of detail on it. But I think as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the downwards pressure on our guidance, if you will, was based on, first of all, our understanding \u2013 a better understanding of the costs to remediate in Brazil. And second piece though to that was obviously the Canadian taxes and then finally, the price recovery in phosphates being slower than what was originally expected because of the late spring. But somewhat offset by higher expected performance from our potash business than might have been in the original guidance. Karen, can I \u2013 you talk\u2026","Karen Swager","Yes. We have factored in a modest recovery in phosphate margins for the rest of the year. Today we believe that NOLA price market is significantly below world price level is $30 to $40 lower than world price levels. So we could see some upside in the numbers that we've used because we just put in a modest recovery for Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.","John Roberts","Thank you. Can you hear me? Hello?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yes.","John Roberts","Yes, sorry. Just to pin you down a little bit more on the dam issues here, it sounds like there was minimal in the first quarter and there'll be minimal in the fourth quarter. So again, it's roughly $50 million \u2013 you gave $50 million for the second quarter, it'll be roughly $50 million in the third quarter as well. Is that correct?","Clint Freeland","Yes, that is correct. The way we expect to see this flow through is, again, most of it is the transport of Miski Mayo rock into Brazil and the extra transport costs of that offset by Miski Mayo costs maybe being a little better. The second piece is the \u2013 some transport costs, most of which is offset by lower cost from Florida for the MAP. And then the third piece is the under utilization of the assets because of the idling. So the first quarter or second quarter here, yes, $50 million. I think we're fairly solid on that. And then third quarter could be up to $50 million depending on execution.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Have a couple of questions on cash flow. In the course of your opening remarks, you said you have to decide on the future of Plant City, if you close Plant City or you have to make arrangements for it, how much can the future cash outlays incrementally be for that? And secondly, you talked in your press release about strong cash flows this year. My guess is that the cash outlays from Brazil and extra costs may reduce your cash generation expectations by, I don't know $300 million this year or something like that. Can you provide some insight into those two issues?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Sure. Thanks Jeff. Okay. Well, let me reiterate that. Yes, and indeed the future of Plant City will have to be decided by July. We have to do that this quarter. And I'm going to let Clint talk a little bit about both how the cash flows this year and how they flow through. Although I will say, I believe there is a table somewhere in the deck that does go through the overall changes to cash flow but Plant City, I think, Clint, you can give some color on that.","Clint Freeland","Sure. Good morning, Jeff. Excuse me. So we've looked at the scenario of what happens if we make the decision to finally close Plant City. And I think there are a couple of things to keep in mind. First of all, you would have a noncash asset write-down, currently the book value of that asset is about $230 million. So you would have a noncash write-off of that to the extent that you permanently closed the facility.","And then the other thing that you would have would be an increase in the ARO, the asset retirement obligation related to that facility. And really that change would be an increase of about $100 million, that change is primarily the effect of the present value calculation associated with it. And obviously that work would be pulled forward. So about a $230 million book value of noncash charge associated with that and then an ARO increase of about $100 million.","Now when you look at the actual cash that we would spin and say over the next five years, I think our preliminary estimate would be in total over that five year period, roughly a $100 million. There are a couple of different lines of work that need to happen, you have the gypstack closures that would need to happen, but you also have some water treatment that would need to happen.","We're looking at a number of different options, particularly for water treatment, different technologies that could meaningfully impact the amount that we would need to spend on that. So that could be variable, but I would say, if you think about cash over the five year period, post-closure, probably in aggregate about $100 million.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Chris Parkinson","Great. Thank you. Hopefully I'm not echoing. Can you just talk a little bit about your update on the outlook for Chinese DAP and MAP exports? Clearly it's been a little noisy just in the very beginning of the year with top producers increasing [up rates] [ph]. But is it still your understanding there will be additional closures in 2019. So if you could comment on your net outlook for the year as well as your expectations for local rock costs, it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay, Chris. Thank you. And I apologize to the group for our line just got lost for a while there, so I apologize. But I'm going to hand this straight over to Andy to talk a little bit about the supply and demand balance for DAP and MAP in China. Andy?","Andy Jung","All right. Thanks Joc. And thanks Chris for the question. So I think we're all aware of that Q1 exports were up year-over-year, a little over 500,000 tonnes. But bear in mind that Q1 is a relatively low volume quarter for exports. It makes up usually 10% to 15% of annual exports. What we've seen from a rock costs standpoint is that rock production was down in 2018 via the official statistics 22% year-over-year. We understand that they had depleted domestic inventories to maintain their downstream production relatively flat.","But that will be putting upward pressure on costs as we move through 2019, we'd also expect to see sulfur prices on the rise. We've seen continued relatively high ammonia costs. So there won't be this upward pressure supporting the price floor in China. And because of that we would expect to see volumes as we move throughout the course of 2019 begin to taper off. And also supporting that is just the emptiness of their domestic channel. So they robbed their domestic channel of tonnes in order to export in Q4 as well as in Q1. And we would expect that in order to replenish that domestic pipeline, they'll have to keep tonnes at home rather than in the export market.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys. If we can continue on that question, let's look at the demand side in China. It's been pretty weak for last couple of years. It doesn't seem to moving much right now and can you talk about what you're seeing and how you think that's going to evolve over the next year?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yes, sure Jonas. I'm going to hand that back to Andy again, but let me make a general comment, which is what we have seen in China, at least for their corn and oilseed type crops is a flattening of the yield curve. So the yields are not increasing, which means that if they don't get back to a better utilization or a more consistent utilization, I believe that they will have yield issues, which doesn't fit their needs to become more self sufficient.","But Andy, do you want to talk a little bit more about all that?","Andy Jung","Yes. In the \u2013 I guess into the minutiae a bit more, production is round about that 25 million tonne mark. Consumption is perhaps a bit over 15 million tonnes, maybe towards 16 million tonnes. And that's left them with the ability last year to export in excess of 11 million tonnes by taking down some pipeline inventories in the country.","As we move into 2019, we think production year-to-date is roughly flat, at least so far through the first quarter. We think that consumption is probably down slightly, maybe in the 0.5 million tonne ZIP Code. And as we move through the rest of the year, we would think that production likely slips a bit lower as some of the environmental compliance issues come to bear or bear further.","And also some of the cost pressures that I talked about earlier and domestic consumption as they replenish the pipeline and look to a fall season, we would expect to see domestic consumption level out. As Joc mentioned, the yields, grain and oilseed yields in China have plateaued and we don't think that that's a sustainable situation for the government there. And then what brings us back to the export volume, we do think year-over-year we'll see a slowdown in the final three quarters of the year. And for the full year beat down marginally versus where we were last year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Adam Samuelson","Yes, thanks. Good morning. So two questions, first just want to get a little more color on your view of spring application, demand thus far and through the first week of May. Just do you see enough product going to ground to actually clear out the inventories on phosphates and I guess to a lesser extent on the potash side, how much is there a risk of product being stranded out of St. Louis that would knock \u2013 hits the ground in time for the spring that then will carry over to the fall and continue to weigh on NOLA values. And then just a clarification question on Clint\u2019s earlier comments on the ARO, the cash outlay over the next couple of years on Plant City, should you decide to close it? Is that covered by the ARO trust or is that incremental cash outlays from the corporation? Thank you.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay, thanks Adam. That's a barrel full. I'm going to hand it to Corrine to talk a little bit about the spring but what we can say is look, spring is going and while there is a small amount of product stuck in St. Louis, it probably will not get up for spring season. That is affecting us a lot less because we are \u2013 have a lot of material in upcountry where we're getting good premiums for right now as much as $95 a tonne premium over the NOLA price, but Corrine, do you want to talk a little bit about that?","Corrine Ricard","Sure. I sure can. Thanks Adam. We certainly experienced a wet cold start to the spring season, but April and early May have brought on some really solid demand. It's important to note that the corn planting is only about 23% completed, so there is a lot of spring yet to go. A lot of fertilizer application to hit the ground that we believe will clean out inventories.","It is true that the barge transportation has been pretty disrupted with flooding and repairs along the U.S. lock and dam system in the upper Mississippi River, and some of the barge resupply may not be hitting the Twin Cities markets and those northern markets until as late as June and that would be pretty late for spring. So the threat of that little bit of barge, a product overhang has been overly impacting the NOLA price levels. I would say is that the volume appears to be much smaller than is expected in the market.","We've attempted to purchase barges to fulfill our needs for our Brazil shipments, and there was not enough products available to be able to put together a vessel that was in any kind of an exportable position and so barge count estimates put probably about 100 barges of which over half are sold, waiting for tows to go to the upper Mississippi river or maybe about 130,000 tonnes is all of the overhang that we really expected out there.","When you put that in the context of a normal 2 million tonnes summer fill program is pretty small and so we don't \u2013 that's why we were so confident that the NOLA price levels are overly discounted. As Joc said, our upcountry positions put us in a great position to be able to see volumes go to our customers. So we've got over 350,000 tonnes in warehouses in the north. We've got about 7,000 rail cars loaded with on fan tracks and fleeted.","And so we've been able to fulfill our customer's needs. They are not waiting. We're finding ways to get them, even though the barge system is disrupted. And as Joc said, that's benefiting our customers because they can get supply from us, but it's benefiting us as well as those upcountry values are a significant premium over NOLA. Our prices today out of Pine Bend are about $400 a short tonne. And that's about a $95 premium over NOLA.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","And Clint do you want to just talk a little bit about the cash outlay of ARO?","Clint Freeland","Sure. Hi Adam. The cash related to the ARO that I just mentioned around Plant City would come out of corporate cash. We do have a trust that's set up. It has about $625 million in assets in it today. But there are some limitations and some rules around when we can begin to take cash out of that to help offset the cost of some of the remediation expenses and we're not there yet.","A matter of fact, I don't think we'll be there for quite some time. So, for Plant City, I would expect to have to use corporate cash to satisfy that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotia Bank. Your line is now open.","Ben Isaacson","Thank you very much and good morning. You've talked a lot about phosphates in China and I was hoping you could address the rest of the world. On Page 18, of your slide deck you have negative demand growth in India, in other Asia, obviously North America has been a bit of a challenge. With OCP and Ma'aden both ramping up this year can you talk about how \u2013 when you triangulate all of that, how long you expect this slower recovery in phosphates to take? Thank you","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Andy, can I hand that straight to you? Thanks Ben. I'm going to hand that straight to Andy to talk about.","Andy Jung","All right Ben. You're correct that, we've downgraded some of our demand expectations for 2019. The biggest drop in demand is China and we've already talked about that, but we see some small, 100, 200,000 tonne a year slower demand in a number of other geographies.","There are some offsets on the supply side that I don't think get probably enough attention and they haven't in the first half of the year simply because they haven't transpired. So you've got the Nutrien Redwater closure, which is basically upon us today. Mosaic\u2019s Brazil curtailments really don't impact the market until the second half of the year. And then swinging back to China once again, it's really a second half of the year story where we expect to see production and exports decline.","And we've seen a few, curtailments Australia, Tunisia, South Africa, Mexico, which will probably continue to bounce around and have some difficulties in the second half of the year as well. And we think that that leaves the market relatively balanced, and then in the second half of the year, frankly tightening back-up relative to the looseness that we've seen here in the first half.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I see from your Brazil guidance that you're expecting to 300,000 tonnes year-over-year increase in Brazil in Q2. It looks like a much bigger mix shift to Q2 that you had last year. Considering all the logistics challenges going on with finished product and raw material in Brazil can you explain, that expectation a little bit more please.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yeah. I might leave this to Ric, if Ric is on the call. Is Ric on our call?","Ric McLellan","Yes, I'm here Joc. I can take that.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yes. Would you take that Ric? Thanks Joel.","Ric McLellan","Yes, I think, a couple things that you have to remember, Joel, is that last year in the second quarter we experienced the impacts of the trucker's strike, which we don't expect to have happen this year. And if we look at the first quarter, the first quarter was a bit slower for domestic demand, both on the distribution side, the farm side and the third party side.","In the second quarter, that's ramped up. And so we frankly look for good volumes, but if you want to circle around the real issue, was the impact of being out of business for 10 to 11 days with the trucker's strike last year.","Ric McLellan","Thanks.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thanks Joel.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Just a question I didn't hear you mention or maybe I missed it when the line cut out, but I didn't hear you mention a African swine flu at all. So just be curious to get what your thoughts are at this point on the impact to global P&K markets, if any short, medium, long-term. Thanks.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay, thanks. Thanks Vincent. Yes, again, Andy has been tracking this and so the African swine fever, I mean we're looking at a big, big call of the Chinese hog fleet or whatever you want to call it. So, I'm going to let Andy talk a little bit about what that might mean and it's a longer term issue rather than necessarily a short term.","Andy Jung","All right, well thanks Vincent. I guess we'd start out to say that there are a lot of unknowns still, and we're watching and monitoring, but we don't have all the answers quite yet. What we do know is that Chinese pork production will certainly be down significantly both this year and probably into next year as well.","Following that feed demand will obviously decline as well. And it could be significant enough that it would erase typical annual global growth in grain and oilseed demand. So, if you look at corn being about 1.1 billion tonnes, soybeans about a third of that 350 million tonnes. So taken together at 2% typical annual growth rate, you're talking a little over 30 million tonnes of grain and oilseed demand that could be lost.","There will be offsets. So the U.S. industry, the Brazilian industry, the European pork industry, they're all setting up to produce more pork and export to China. So, there will be increased feed consumption in those geographies.","And then just to put it into some context, if you look at the E10 program that China is set to roll out, the incremental demand from Corn for an E10 program in China would be in excess of that 30 million to 32 million tonnes of feed demand that would be lost. So, there are a lot of potential offsets out there that we continue to monitor as well.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","But Andy, would you also say though, once the pork starts it being regrown then the demand will increase back to what it was and beyond.","Andy Jung","Yes. So that will probably take a couple years, maybe up to five years depending on the longevity of this outbreak and the severity of the outbreak. And what you likely will see you is bit of a whiplash event where feed demand ramps up very quickly as higher pork prices incentivize, bigger rations and faster growth plans for the hog barns.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning. Joc I have a couple of questions on the Florida and Brazil. With Brazilians mine shut down at least for now, why wouldn't you run Florida mines harder and bring phosphates from there as opposed to bringing a rock from Peru. And then secondly, on Florida as you make your strategic decision on Plant City, in potash you played price or volume strategy, should we expect similar strategy in phosphates from you? Thank you.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay, PJ, let me just give you a little bit of an understanding if you will, on the Brazilian rock and bringing in Brazilian rock from Miski Mayo. The Brazilian market is made up of a number of products including SSP, animal feed. TSP, MAP only the MAP really can be imported from Florida.","We don't have rock to export to that location from Florida. So we are stuck or not stuck, but we are required to export Miski Mayo rock to Brazil to make-up the SSP and the feed that we wouldn't be making. So that's the first piece.","The Florida, we will export as much from Florida as we believe the market will take. And you're right, that is the best economic way to do that. In terms of price over volumes strategy, I think we have previously said the conditions on which we would start-up Plant City again, and I think we can consistently say those haven't changed from a year ago. So, I think I can, at least say that about where that might be going.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","Don Carson","Yes, thank you. I want to go back to North American application outlook for P&K. She noted only 23% of the crops planted, but it's a pretty narrow pre-plant application window. Now obviously a nudge and you can side dress after you plant the crop but that appears pretty limited in P&K. So, do you think we could lose some application here that would be postponed to the fall or do you think it gets lost for good this calendar year? Because, I noticed on your North American, update for both P&K, you really didn't change that much from your February outlook.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thanks Don. I'm going to leave this straight over to Andy and Karen. Andy, Karen?","Karen Swager","Thanks Don. We have a fairly narrow window that remains, however we believe that as long as product is available, we're going to see application that goes with the rest of that corn planting. And as we said, Mosaic is an imposition to have a product available for customers in the north. We do believe that the application and demand overall will be relatively unchanged.","We may see some of what we have lost last fall will be potentially replaced next fall. We don't think we will be seeing a lot of those tonnes in the spring season this year, but perhaps in the fall. Andy, do you want to talk about that some more?","Andy Jung","Well I\u2019ll just add little bit of color in that, we've seen seasons like this before and the historical data shows us that by and large you really don't miss on farm demand. Whatever problems exist the industry and whether it's producers, distributors, retailers, farmers themselves, we'll find a way to get the product to ground because you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a bag of seed and then not feed that plant.","Don Carson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yes. Hi, good morning. I'm just wanted to talk a little bit more on the potash side of the market. I wanted to get your sense in terms of the brine inflow cost, I know 28 million in the quarter and just trying to understand the margin compression a little bit. How much of that is from price and how much of that was from potentially the spillover effect of running your plants in 1Q at a lower level that's going to compress the 2Q margins versus the 1Q margins.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay. Thanks Michael. Yes, I can answer the margin compression. It's virtually exactly what you said. The idea of running the plants at a slower rate in the first quarter will impact the cost profile in the second quarter. The second thing that happens is recognition of revenues in the second quarter will change the product mix slightly, which also impacts those margins. But most of that is flow on of the pricing from the first quarter.","Now your question on brine inflow costs, I would say they are managing that quite effectively now and that's the reason we've seen I think up to $100 million lower costs per annum than we had maybe four or five years ago, which is really great to see.","Clint Freeland","One thing, excuse me, Michael, the one thing that I would also add to that around the margin impact and now the second quarters recall that the increase in CRT, the taxes are going to start flowing through in the second quarter. So that'll need to be factored in as well.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Falcao from HSBC. Your line is now open.","Alex Falcao","Right. Thanks for your question and good morning. I have two questions. One regarding in Brazil, we saw yesterday Vale coming back and saying that they would probably operate or restart the operations at Brumadinho mine in a couple of weeks, I just want you to know if that's a leading indicator, since they were the ones most affected and seems that, there is sort of a normalization on licensing in Brazil. And that could lead to a better than expected a reopenings for you guys that\u2019s the first question.","And the second question is on freights specifically on potash, we saw a huge decline in the first quarter. Is that something that is going to continue going forward, for freight and what's the reason for that? Thank you. On freight, on freight, for potash specifically, right? So the potash freight cost is down, significantly. I just want to know what's the reason for that and is that something that should continue in second quarter?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay, great. Well, let's talk, start with Vale. There is no question that time will settle a lot of the churn in Brazil. And I think, yes, Vale restarting in a couple of weeks is probably a good sign. It means that they're starting to be some level of discussion between regulators and Vale and that may be returning to a level of normalcy.","In terms of our expectations, our plans are relatively set now so I don't see it affecting us per se in terms of coming in back earlier. In terms of Canpotex freight and the overall freight from \u2013 I mean I\u2019ll hand that to Karen.","Karen Swager","Yes. I believe what's happening there is that proportion of tonnes that are going to Canpotex versus the North American distribution system. We don't pay the freight Canpotex pays the freight on those export shipments whereas we do on the domestic shipments and with the North American fill season a little bit lower, we had less winter fill shipments to the domestic market and its associated freight costs.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Joc O\u2019Rourke","There's no more questions, let me conclude. To conclude our call today, I would like to reiterate our key points. First. We have a well-defined path forward to manage through the dam situation in Brazil and we are confident that we will be able to continue to meet our Brazilian customer needs.","Second, despite regulatory and weather related challenges, Mosaic continues to deliver very strong results for this quarter, and our outlook for the year continues to be strong. And third, Mosaic is executing very well and we've made tremendous progress on our business transformations. Today Mosaic is a stronger and more resilient company than ever, and we're in an excellent position to deliver strong returns across the cycle.","So thank you for all you for joining our call and have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call, thank you everyone for joining.

LLC","Operator","Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to The Mosaic Company's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2017 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning. Thank you for joining us today. It's been just three weeks since our Analyst Day in New York, where we focused on our medium and long-term outlook. So, today, we'll focus on the quarter and the near-term. Rich Mack and I will keep our prepared remarks brief and then take your questions.","Potash and phosphate prices continue to recover during the quarter, as global demand remained strong. Our earnings do not yet fully reflect these dynamics for a number of reasons. But we expect market improvements and more reliable operating performance to drive higher earnings in the second quarter and in the second half of the year. Our quarterly results were disappointing and fell short of our expectations because of several operational items. Rich will provide more detail on this shortly.","Despite the lower earnings, we continue to make progress on our priorities. I have three key takeaways for today's earnings call. First, we are continuing to manage our costs and capital carefully. Second, markets have moved upwards even if the pace of recovery has not been linear. And third, we have taken necessary and bold actions to position Mosaic to capitalize on better business conditions.","For the first quarter, Mosaic reported a breakeven earnings per share on $1.6 billion in net sales. Looking ahead, we expect improvements in our business unit and consolidated margin rate driving strong earnings in the second quarter. Our work to reduce cost continues to provide meaningful benefits. We are ahead of schedule on our 2018 goal to reduce costs by $500 million and we are well on our way to achieving the additional $75 million savings target that we announced a year ago.","You can see the progress in our SG&A expenses and in cash production costs, with potash costs remaining near 10-year low in spite of a mechanical issue at one of our Esterhazy shafts. In fact, total MOP cash cost per tonne for the quarter were $86 including $11 per tonne of expenses relating to the skip failure we had last month and $20 a tonne of brine management expense.","I want to emphasize two points on our expense reduction work. First, we're taking out costs across Mosaic in every business unit and support function. That requires innovative thinking from our employees every day, how to make processes more efficient without sacrificing safety, and they are delivering. And second, we are not going to take our eye off the ball as markets improved. We understand that being a low-cost producer is critical in this industry across the cycle.","In addition, our focus for the remainder of 2017 will be on integration planning for the upcoming Vale Fertilizantes transaction. As we said on our Analyst Day, we will continue to look for value-creation opportunities in the medium term, but first things first. We are giving the Vale Fertilizantes transaction a great deal of thought and attention so that it can achieve our strategic objectives.","Little has changed in the market environment since our Analyst Day, so I won't go through all of that in detail. Global demand remained strong, and we have narrowed our expected global shipments to the upper end of the ranges. I wanted to address one issue that is getting a lot of attention these days, Chinese phosphate exports. With economic and environmental pressures mounting on Chinese producers, we expect their exports to fall to somewhere around 8 million tonnes.","The recently released March export figures show a modest increase in Q1 exports compared to last year. First quarter represents a small percentage of the yearly cadence of exports, and we continue to expect year-over-year declines for the remainder of the year. Overall, while this quarter included some noise, Mosaic continues to make good progress, and the markets are giving us some momentum. We are executing our strategy and managing cost and capital. And we are in excellent position to thrive as markets continue to improve.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich Mack.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all. Today, I'll briefly review our segment performance for the quarter and take you through the reasoning behind our second quarter guidance. In Phosphates, shipment volumes were at the top end of our guidance range due to continuing strong global demand and expectations of a strong spring application season in North America. Prices were in the middle of our guidance range and our operating rate was 79%, which was also in line with our expectations.","The Phosphates margin rate was below our guidance primarily due to an unplanned mechanical issue at our Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant where we experienced a failure in a converter two months before a planned turnaround. The plant was down for several weeks towards the end of the quarter, so some of the costs related to the downtime are reflected in our current quarter's results.","Additionally, we had to buy more ammonia on the spot market just after ammonia prices had risen significantly. The combined negative impact on gross margin was $14 million or 1.7 percentage points. The plant will complete its scheduled turnaround and is expected to be up and running by mid-May, so ammonia costs will continue to run higher in our Phosphates segment in the second quarter.","Our guidance for the second quarter reflects the higher selling prices we are seeing in the market today and robust shipments with continued strong global demand as well as higher operating rates. We expect the second quarter margin rate to increase compared to the first quarter, but we also expect that it will be negatively impacted by the higher ammonia costs I just reviewed and, to a lesser extent, the weather-related issues that have hampered our operations at our joint venture mine in Peru.","The western coast of South America has experienced record rainfall over the past two months which resulted in severe flooding that had major impacts on infrastructure and the people living in the area. The Miski Mayo mine, which was down for parts of March and April, is back to production now. As the weather issues played out, we and our joint venture partners have joined together to provide critical relief for the mine's employees and the surrounding community.","To ensure that we could keep our Louisiana plant running to meet demand, we purchased third-party rock. This was a temporary development and we do not expect long-term implications for rock supply or for costs.","For the second quarter, we expect realized DAP prices to range from $320 to $340 per tonne with volumes in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes. We expect gross margin to improve to approximately 10%.","As we get into the second half, we see a continuation of gradual improvement in Phosphate margins, as we realize the benefits of higher industry stripping margins, improving cost control and more normal operating rates at Faustina and Miski Mayo. The second half margins will also reflect purchases of ammonia under the CF contract as we expect to begin taking product in early September.","In the Potash business, our operating rates were lower than expected because of the incident with a skip at the Esterhazy K2 mine. K2 is back up and running now, but we expect the incident to reduce our second quarter shipments by approximately 200,000 tonnes. Our Potash shipment volumes were below guidance for this quarter because of a Canpotex train derailment and weather-related port loading delays. Approximately 150,000 tonnes that we expected to recognize in the first quarter have been recognized in the second quarter.","Our Potash gross margin rate fell short of our guidance. There are two main reasons for the shortfall in margin rate and margin dollars. First, roughly $22 million of costs associated with the skip incident were reflected in the current quarter's results. And second, lower than expected sales volumes due to the Canpotex-related logistics issues I just highlighted reduced per unit profitability. Otherwise, as Joc noted, our excellent cost control in the Potash business unit continued.","For the second quarter, we expect Potash shipment volumes in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes, with strong demand persisting. Prices are expected to rise modestly to a range of $170 to $185 per tonne, and margins are expected to improve to the low 20% range.","Moving on to the International Distribution segment, results were generally in line with our guidance. We sold 1.3 million tonnes of product and realized a gross margin per tonne of $21 in our international markets. International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in a range of 1.4 million to 1.7 million tonnes in the second quarter, while margins are expected to remain in the $20 per tonne range. Our full year guidance ranges have not changed.","Beginning in 2017, we have changed our depreciation method from straight line to a units-of-production method for certain mining assets to more appropriately reflect the utility of these assets. The change in depreciation method to a units-of-production method is consistent with our peers and will be more comparable going forward. In connection with the change, with the increased focus on mechanical integrity and capital expenditures, we have taken action to allow us to operate our assets over a longer period of time and have extended the lives where appropriate. As a result, we expect an approximate $70 million non-cash P&L benefit in 2017 from a reduction in depreciation expense.","Before I conclude, a couple of notes on the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. First, we are planning to issue debt to finance the cash portion of the purchase price in the late summer timeframe. And second, we expect to change our segment reporting post close. We will give you plenty of notice before our first reporting cycle under the new structure and we plan to provide adequate historical detail.","To summarize, we are continuing to focus on the things we can control. We are controlling our costs and we are making prudent capital decisions to ensure we can deliver strong shareholder value in the future. We expect meaningfully better results in the second quarter and the second half of this year.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks. Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Rich. Mosaic continues to focus on controlling costs and capital in challenging but improving markets. If we look at this in stages, I believe in the near term, we will continue to see modest improvements in the business environment. In the medium term, as we bring on the Vale assets, Mosaic can accelerate its ability to outperform. And over the longer term, as global demand continues to grow and absorb the industry's capacity expansions, Mosaic's potential is very bright.","We have made tremendous progress as an organization and we've made bold decisions to build our potential to win in the marketplace and to grow.","With that, I will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Rich, I'm just hoping you can get us just a better sense on the Phosphate side of things. Obviously, a lot of moving parts this quarter and maybe a bit into next quarter. But where would underlying margins have been without sort of all the issues? And then, you did talk about things getting better in the second half? Can you give us a rough range of where you think Phosphate gross margins can come in, in the second half?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Vincent. As you ask this of Rich, I'll hand it straight over to him to answer. Go ahead, Rich.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Vincent, I think that absent some of the issues that we saw in Louisiana, we probably would have had a couple of percentage point improvement to gross margin. As we look forward to the second quarter, our guidance for the gross margin rate of approximately 10% does take into account some of the additional costs that we will incur in the second quarter related to that same issue.","And then going forward, we do see an improving market environment on a gradual basis on the pricing side and, hopefully, some tapering off of the recent run-up in raw material costs. And so, as we look towards the second half of the year, I think 10% in the second quarter or something hopefully a little bit better than that in the second half is what we would be expecting.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein Research. Your line is open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about the impact of the Chinese contracts, if they don't get renewed or if they do get renewed with a higher price? What does that mean for your Q2?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Jonas, and good morning, as you started with. Look, let me start by saying, first of all, from our perspective, the Chinese contract is becoming less and less relevant over time. The Chinese makes up a portion of Canpotex's overall sales. And the buying committee, who set this contract, make up only a portion of that Canpotex shipments to China. So, we see it as a less and less impact overall.","The other point I want to make before handing it over to Corrine is that the conditions are significantly different this year than other years when it's been delayed. This year, the reason for the delay, I think, largely is the suppliers aren't willing to make concessions. Asia is not waiting for China. You see the European prices are strong. Brazil prices have been strong. I don't think we're seeing the slowdown that we might have expected if China doesn't settle. Corrine, do you want to talk a little bit about that China contract and just the details from Canpotex?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Just a couple things that I would add, Joc. I think that the inventory levels at the ports are not a lot higher than last year at this time. It's pretty normal levels. We're seeing good purchasing throughout Asia and values are significantly up. And as Joc said, suppliers are not willing to break on the price levels that they're getting in the rest of Asia. And we could see India get ahead of China again this year like they did last year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","So, I guess the summary of that, Jonas, just to answer the question, the Q2 impact, we don't assume a whole bunch of Chinese product in our Q2 guidance. And as they come out and don't settle, like, I guess, it will make a small impact but pretty minor.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Two questions. One on potash. What are you seeing in terms of domestic dealers, their willingness to buy ahead of the legacy ramp? Are they trying to get inventories down as low as they can ahead of that startup? And maybe you could comment on what your FPD book looks like. And then, on the phosphate side, how should we think of the CF contract? At current ammonia prices and natural gas cost, would that be a net positive for you from a margin standpoint?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Don. I'm going to hand this one straight to Corrine to talk about the potash customers and their actions as we go into the middle of the year, and then I'll hand it to Rich who has the handle on the CF contract.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Joc. For potash buying, we aren't seeing a big impact in the market. Domestic buyers are positioning for a good spring season. It's still pretty wet out there and they haven't gotten started to the full extent for the season. So, we're still seeing good shipments, good demand, and really little pre-positioning or worrying about K+S coming in with big tonnage in the domestic market.","In terms of the CF contract, current values today, Rich, I will turn it over to you to add, I would just say that the spike in the ammonia prices today it's pretty close to market value on these contracts. And I'll leave it to Rich to comment further.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Yes. So, Don, just a reminder, this is a producer-type sharing relationship that we have with CF and so there are going to be times where we're going to be in the money and there will be times when we are out of the money. And as Corrine just said, not long ago, ammonia prices were $40, $50 lower than where they are right now. And in that environment, we were probably out of the money relative to what we were going to be paying CF under the contract. But it's a very volatile market and, with that uptick, now, it's closer to parity is what I would say.","I think the bigger issue that we want to keep in mind here as well is we just are commissioning a brand new ammonia vessel and tug, and that's been a project that has been long in the works. Those pieces of equipment are in the water in a testing mode right now. And we believe, long-term, that is going to be very beneficial for Mosaic to arbitrage and basically keep down where world ammonia prices go for the betterment of our overall phosphate business. Because as you know, the relationship that we have with CF is only for about 1\/3 of our ammonia requirements compared to the additional 1.2 million tonnes that we're still buying in the marketplace.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wong from RBC Capital. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions around price realization. So the first one would be on just the general ranges of the DAP and the potash price outlooks. They look like they're about flat at the midpoint but in the benchmark prices look like they've actually strengthened a bit. So, could you talk a little bit about why there's a difference in the movements there?","And then just on the quarter, the realized DAP price was actually up quarter-over-quarter, Q1 versus Q4. But when I look at the overall segment, average realized price, just by dividing revenues by volume, it actually looks like it's down quarter-over-quarter. So, is there something that's driving that weaker realization versus the reported DAP price? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Andrew. I'm going to hand this straight over to Corrine and Mike Rahm to give you some answers here. But I will say it at the out-front. I'm not sure I fully understand your DAP price question, but I assume what you're probably seeing is the lag between when we actually book a sale and what you see as spot prices. And then the other one is the mix of products that we sell on an ongoing basis. And so, as the mix changes, so does the average of the prices. But I'll leave it over to Corrine to answer that first guidance question.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Price realizations have been moving out steadily. Rich talked about this in his comments. Q4 was $317 for DAP. Q1 is $327. You're right, the guidance is right on the midpoint. But when you've got the seasonality, that Q1 sales included a lot of fill tonnes and a little bit for spring, and the Q2 guidance includes spring season as well as postseason. We've got quite an influx of import barges that have dampened price levels that we expect postseason, when we get past this peak, we're going to some of that mixing into the price level. Mike, do you want to add on the comments on the issue?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","No, I think the only thing I would add is that we think in terms of margins. And as we get into the second and third quarters, we expect there will be continued relief on raw material costs. So, while DAP prices, the benchmark may be up less than people expect, I think the margin has the potential to increase more with some raw material cost relief. I think the other issue is just the product mix that we talked about, even with MicroEssentials, that's a product that there's greater margin but more moderate prices associated with that, as well as some of the changes that have taken place in the feed market which also has been hurt pretty badly by the big surge of imports recently.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So, you changed your depreciation method from straight line to more unit of production, so couple of questions. Under straight line, what was your lifespan of your assets in both P and K? And then when as you switch under the new method, what would be the implied life of your assets in both P and K?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","I'm going to hand this to Rich right away. But let me take a general comment on our depreciation method and the change. Clearly, and this came up quite a bit last year. When you have assets that you shut down for a period of time, you're not reflecting the real rate of decline of the asset if you don't match your production rate with the depreciation rate. So, if you do a straight-line depreciation, it does not match well with the type of wear and tear that our actual equipment is exposed to. Whereas if you run with depreciation according to units of production, you more closely align with what actually is happening. So, that's the underlying reason for it. Rich, I'm going to give it to you to give the details, but.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Sure, P.J. This is a project that has been in the works for a long period of time. Obviously, you can't make a change like this without a lot of work that goes into the analysis. There's no simple one answer to your question because asset categories change and they vary. And we had a comprehensive review of all of our asset classifications and what the estimated useful life was for each of the categories. Some of them changed. Some of them were lengthened. Some of them did not change at all. And so, it really depends on what you're looking at.","I would say, when you take a look at how we went about reviewing this and the move to the unit of production methodology, we're probably still far more conservative than some of our peers are in terms of the useful life that we would assign to our assets. And the fact of the matter is, is that we've been through a significant mechanical integrity program over the last several years. We have maintained our assets very well. We are reducing our capital expenditures across the board as you know. And it's our full expectation that we're going to be using these assets for a longer period of time in the future. And that's just some background and color in terms of the depreciation change.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. On slide 4, the forecast is for Chinese exports to be relatively stable, not much seasonality in the rest of the year. Is that normal? It's different than the pattern that we've had the past couple years, but there's no real pattern. Maybe we just averaged it out because we can't really figure it out yet.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, John. In terms of the Chinese exports, let me start by saying there, I mean, there is obviously seasonality to that. And the first quarter is historically a very low quarter. Mike Rahm has the details on how he sees that playing out through the year. So, I'm going to give it to him to talk about the seasonality, if you will.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Good morning, John. As you can see from the chart, first quarter was up about 22%. But as it indicates, that is a seasonally slow quarter. We do expect that exports will pick up in the second and third quarter, much of that tied to Indian purchases. What I will say is that these numbers come kind of straight from our China team and their assessment of how that pattern plays out. And obviously, what's reflected in that is the expectation that the environmental audits taking place today will have an impact, as will some of the changes taking place in the phosphate industry. So, I would say that, yeah, the seasonality looks a bit different but we do expect that there will be significant changes coming down the road for the rest of 2017.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Oliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc.","It's Oliver Rowe in for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. I just will do a follow up on that last question that was asked. So, you're forecasting about a 15% decline this year around Chinese exports. So, what's your longer term view for sort of the sustainable export level? And then how long do you think it will take to get to that level.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Again, I'm going to \u2013 Mike looks after our long-term strategic analysis, so I'm going to hand it to him. But we do expect a long-term sustainable lower rate out of China, and we've talked about that a little bit before. But I would say that makes China to be a smaller but a much stronger and more stable supplier. Mike, do you want to...?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. Yeah, we've done a lot of work here recently on that. And what we expect exports to drop from 9.5 to 8 million tonnes this year. When we do kind of an import demand versus export supply analysis, and assuming that demand grows about 2% per year, in fact, we assumed that demand will grow about 2.1% per year from the 66.4 million tonnes in 2016, so about 73 million tonnes plus in 2021. And when we boil that down to what's import demand relative to export supply, assume that the Saudis ramp up, the Moroccans ramp up, everyone else ramp runs at normal-type rates, we see a sustainable number out of China still in that 7 million tonne to 8 million tonne range during the next five years. So, that's what our analysis tells us at this point.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody. Maybe a question on \u2013 in phosphates, and considering about some of the previous questions in China and the seaborne trade, can you talk about the confidence of supply rationalization that you have there? Domestic off-take this year has been lackluster and some of the industry supply discipline doesn't seem to have come to fruition.","And then somewhat related in the seaborne market, you're going to have more capacity available out of Morocco and Saudi Arabia later this year. Can you talk about the seaborne market balances for DAP as you move later into 2017 and into 2018? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yes, on that basis, I'm going to hand that straight to you, Mike.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","All right. Good morning, Adam. Yeah. Just to follow up on what we said earlier, we do see decent demand growth over the next five years. And just when you do the math, we're projecting about a 7 million tonne plus increase in domestic or in global shipments between 2016 and 2021. When you weight that up against the expected increases in capacity during that period with the third and fourth hubs in Morocco, you have another couple of million tonnes and with the phase two expansion at Ma'aden, you have another roughly 3 million tonnes.","And if you assume that you get maybe a little bit more tonnage coming from places like Tunisia and so forth. It looks like a well-balanced situation over the next five years, now \u2013 and that goes back to what we said on the previous answer that, we think, China still needs to probably export 7 million to 8 million tonnes. That's not to say that over the next year or so, when some of this new capacity comes on, there may not be some pain or disruptions caused by a big surge of capacity. But over the five-year period, we certainly see a well-balanced situation in the global phosphate market.","And frankly, when you look beyond the next five years, you're probably going to hear rumblings of additional hubs getting built in Morocco, additional phases of expansion in Saudi Arabia. And frankly, after 2021, there will be the need for additional capacity coming from somewhere if you expect phosphate demand to continue to grow at a couple of percent per year. So, bottom line, balanced, longer-term outlook in our view with \u2013 as new capacity comes on, there will be some pressure likely until the market absorbs some of that.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","And, Adam, just one. This is Rich. One thing to supplement, keep in mind that these plants, it's not like you turn a key and all of a sudden you're producing 3 million tonnes of product on an annual basis. The modern project will start producing phosphate some time during the second half of 2017. We probably estimate anywhere from 300,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes of production this year and then that project will be ramping up for the vast majority of 2018. And so, if you take the first project as any example in terms of how that has progressed, it's going to be a period of time before that is operating at, call it, 85% or higher operating rates.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning.","Silke Kueck - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I was wondering how much of the $70 million in lower G&A you may have or you realized in the first quarter and whether you'll get this on a straight line basis or it all shows up in, like, one or two quarters. And it seems like that most of it benefits the phosphate segment. Is that correct?","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Silke, the first quarter, we have made the change and you see about $20 million of benefit in terms of reduced depreciation. And in terms of the mix, keep in mind that we had the skip failure, which resulted in some downtime in the potash business in the first quarter and therefore, that's probably why you're seeing more of the benefit on the phosphate side.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. A couple of mining-related questions. Does 90-10 splits between phosphate rock out of Florida versus Miski Mayo, what do you think that could be longer-term? And why? Is that Peruvian deposit lower cost or higher phosphate content? What's your longer-term outlook on that? And then with respect to potash mining in Saskatchewan, can you just provide a comment on where the brine inflow issue is Esterhazy? Are there still ongoing efforts to grout that and change that longer term?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thank you, Steve. Look, let me take the 90-10 question first. I think the question as you ask it, so the big opportunity for us with Miski Mayo is not to replace Florida rock, but to supplement Florida rock, which allows us to have, as you say, a blend, which gives different sets of impurities. But also allows us to extend the life of our Florida operation.","Now, as we go forward, one of the benefits of the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition is the increased ownership of Miski Mayo. So, we could \u2013 suggested, we could probably double the amount of Miski Mayo rock that we bring to either Florida or Louisiana in the next couple of years based on the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. So, long term, what's the benefit? It really doesn't make a huge difference between costs from Miski Mayo, although we pay a, what I would call, transfer price, and then the earnings come in equity earnings. So, it's a little bit different because of being a joint venture.","In terms of brine inflow, our costs in brine inflow have been relatively constant now for probably a year, and we expect those to stay relatively constant going forward. Are we still grouting? Yes. Do we still have a long-term focus there? Yes. That will change probably somewhere around 2018, 2019 as we are able to take more risks on that. And I don't think we need to \u2013 that's good.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Stuart Henry - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Good morning. This is Mike Henry in for Mike Piken. Thank you for taking my question. Just jumping back to the Chinese exports on the phosphate side. Wondering how important those reduced exports are to your expectation for improved phosphate margins in the back half of the year. If Chinese exports are offset by some amount of new overseas production, what type of impact does that have on your margins, or will margins still improve just from a cost basis? And then also just wondering if you have seen any kind of impact from the wet start here in the U.S. planting season. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. So, let's do this in reverse. In terms of the wet start, I'm going to hand it to Corrine to answer some questions. But clearly, we expected an early spring here in North America, and this weather has slowed it down to be, at best, average and probably actually a little behind average. So, certainly, there is an impact to our first quarter and it allowed a lot of imports to come into the U.S. that wouldn't have otherwise had time to get here. So, it did have a reasonable impact on us. In terms of the Chinese exports, I'm going to leave that straight to Mike. Corrine, did you want to talk about the weather impacts first?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. So, it is a wet start to spring. It's a little behind where we thought it would be and where we would normally see. We're pleased to see prices holding well at the interior warehouses where we've got potash positioned. Phosphates have been impacted by the barge, excessive barge imports that have happened late. They arrived late. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a price impact there. But up-country, the prices are holding quite a bit better than what you see out of the New Orleans market. And we're looking forward beyond spring season. It looks like good application rates. Beyond spring season really strong demand is still ahead of us with Indian imports going well and Brazilian imports expected to be strong for later in the season.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Mike, do you want to talk about the S&D for phosphates for the year?","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. As I said, we think the market probably needs 8 million tonnes or maybe a little bit more coming from China this year. That's what we've baked in, and we think that's consistent with the developments that are taking place in China in terms of the impacts of the environmental audits and some of the changes in industry structure there.","As we get into the second half of the year, I think there's a very good demand story unfolding that we think Brazil has big buying needs ahead of us. We think Indian imports are going to be up more than 0.5 million tonnes. Brazil will be importing record volumes. So, we do see a strong pull second half of the year. As Corrine and Joc mentioned, North American season, while a few fits and starts is still going to be a very good season following an outstanding fall application.","So, demand is a very good story and the drivers, whether they're the agronomic and economic drivers remain very positive for both phosphate and potash. So, as we get into the second half of the year, if the Chinese export 8 million tonnes, we think that's going to allow margins to move up given the supply and demand dynamics.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. In Central Asia, it seems like prices are falling a little bit for DAP, but could you just comment overall on your global sales mix on a go-forward basis, Central Asia versus LatAm South? And feel free to bring any comments on Brazilian MAP or MicroEssentials. Just overall as the demand picture develops, how should we think about your regional mix and netbacks versus prior years and subsequent effects on second half margins? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Corrine, I'm going to hand that straight to you again.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. I suspect Chris that you're referring to some slip in price that we've seen for the Indian imports and there has been a little bit of a price break, although I've been impressed at how well it's held. We're still seeing $365 and admittedly down a little bit from the $370 starting point, but nowhere near the prices that were bid by the Indian buyers earlier when they were issuing these tenders. And so, really relative strength, a couple of dollars off into Central Asia.","I think over the longer term as you think about our mix and netbacks, we will, as you see the second Ma'aden project starting up our joint venture, you're going to see our mix won't appear to change what ships out of Florida, maybe not making it all the way to India and quite as a big volumes and we may be taking more of that tonnage out of the Ma'aden joint venture. And so, it'll be a little bit heavier appearance of the tonnage going into Latin America, I suspect, in North America. But we will still be there in the Indian market with other origins of product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Howard Flinker from Flinker & Company. Your line is open.","Howard Flinker - Flinker & Co. LLC","Hello, everybody, or bonjour maybe. What was the D&A for this quarter and what was it in the same quarter last year, please?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. I think that might take us a couple of seconds to drag up here, Howie, because that's fairly technical.","Richard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.","Howard, I'm just taking a look at it here. So, in Q1 of 2017, our D&A was $159 million and the same quarter a year ago, it was $184 million. I hope that's responsive to your question.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Next question?","Operator","And our next question will come from John Roberts from UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for double dip. I asked the earlier question on the Chinese, another major player in the market is OCP and they're going to host a group of local investors in about two weeks. Are they expected to be relatively stable from a competitive perspective over the rest of the year here? Do you have any thoughts on them in the market since you commented on the Chinese as well?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yes, I'm going to hand again \u2013 hand it to Mike. Mike, OCP's market response this year.","Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Just in terms of their capacity, they're bringing on their third hub now, and they've indicated that their fourth hub will be coming on later this year. I think when you look at their sales mix, they've done a great job in terms of developing the African market. Just looking at their lineup periodically, there are times when well over half of what they're shipping is going to the African market. So, they're developing markets that they're serving. And I think they've indicated that, as time goes on, they expect to capture about half of the growth in global demand, and they are a very formidable, good competitor in this market.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. With that, I think we're about ready to close. No more questions. What I just want to end the call with, though, is to say we have to be careful to separate the operational issues with the market. In the market, we have to separate seasonal slowness in the first quarter with the long-term up-cycle that we're starting to see in overall.","So, to conclude the call, I just want to reiterate our key points. While our results for the first quarter did not meet our expectations, we've moved past the operational issues we encountered. Our cost and capital continues to be well controlled, and we are building considerable leverage to deliver shareholder value as the market improves. We expect to deliver stronger performance in the second quarter and the remainder of this year as we focus on integration of our Vale Fertilizantes acquisition.","Again, thank you for joining us today and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes the prepared remarks, lines will be opened to take your questions. Your host for today\u2019s call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic\u2019s accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Rich will share his insights into the results and our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management\u2019s beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jim. Jim?","James Prokopanko","Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter earnings discussion.","Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate progress on our strategic priorities. Compared to last year, the timely acquisition of CF Industries\u2019 phosphates business added $0.06 to our quarterly earnings per share. Expense initiatives and asset optimization drove lower potash cost per tonne, adding $0.07 per share in the quarter, despite a negative $0.15 per share impact of the change in Canadian resource taxes and royalties.","Finally, repurchases of 62 million shares added another $0.07 in EPS this quarter. And this is just the beginning of the benefit we will generate from those moves. Nothing about our bullish long-term outlook for Mosaic\u2019s future has changed since our Analyst Day, so we won\u2019t repeat the full story on today\u2019s call. Instead our prepared comments will be brief, with a focus on the market conditions we expect for the second quarter and second-half of 2015.","I\u2019ll begin with a review of our solid first-quarter results which were well ahead of last year. Then Rich Mack will discuss segment results, our capital position, and our guidance. And finally, I\u2019ll conclude with a view of the evolving global phosphate and potash market dynamics.","Our message to you today is simple, Mosaic is delivering solid performance and we expect 2015 to be a good year. For the quarter, Mosaic generated $295 million in net earnings or $0.80 per share, almost a 50% increase over the weaker first quarter of 2014. Our adjusted earnings were $0.70 per share, with foreign currency transaction gains accounting for most of the difference. I want to emphasize that we continue to generate significant cash with $656 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter.","Our results were within our guidance ranges, say for the phosphate operating rate, which missed the low end of the range by 1 percentage point as a result of an accelerated plant turnaround.","In potash, volumes came in at low-end of our expectations primarily due to lower North American shipments. The late arriving spring compounded by increased imports sitting in the Gulf of Mexico has impacted demand and pricing in much of North America. The new potash contract with China not only provided price transparency for customers elsewhere in the world. The volumes also demonstrated the pent-up demand, we\u2019ve been anticipating.","If our expectations for the second-half of 2015 hold, our challenge will be to produce enough tonnes to deliver contracted volumes. Historically, timing of North America demand and shipments during this time of year is uncertain. This year delayed North American crop progress and changes in dealer inventories make it even harder to predict, but the uncertainty is around shipments, not necessarily actual application rates.","Spring arrives and farmers plant their crop, this year is no different. In fact, we\u2019ve increased our estimates for global potash shipments to the high-end of our previous range. We now estimate 2015 global potash shipments to be in the 59 million tonne to 60 million tonne range.","Potash elasticity of demand appears higher than we previously believed, and we may continue to see strong demand growth if prices of our products remain as affordable as they are now. We continue to expect a good second-half of 2015, though our medium-term outlooks still needs to the informed by U.S. crop developments, grain and oilseed prices.","With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. And then, I\u2019ll conclude with our views of the diverging markets around the world.","Richard Mack","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019ll begin today with some detail on our three operating segments. In the phosphate segment, the primary contributor of our improving profitability is higher selling prices for our products, with the average DAP price $45 higher than a year ago, as well as volumes from the CF phosphate acquisition. In addition, we also continue to capture stronger margins from our premium MicroEssentials product.","Raw material prices were higher this quarter compared to a year-ago, but the sequential quarter trend was in our favor. Sulfur prices have declined over $30 per tonne in recent months, and we believe the falling market prices for urea foretell lower ammonia prices going forward. All told, the cost of sulfur and ammonia in one tonne of DAP has dropped about $45 since last November. We believe that Mosaic\u2019s leadership position and our previous decision to operate at lower rates contributed to these trends.","In the potash segment, our strong margins and significantly improved year-over-year earnings were driven primarily by our operating efficiency. Our cost reduction efforts including our decision to stop MOP production at Carlsbad, and decommission and sell the Hersey mine are delivering meaningful value to the bottom line, and importantly shifting us to the left on the global cost curve. In fact, first quarter MOP cash cost per tonne were $86 including $17 of brine management expenses. This is a $5 per tonne improvement over our impressive fourth quarter numbers. These costs are significantly better than what you saw for Mosaic in prior years.","This is the first full quarter with ADM\u2019s fertilizer business under our belt, with integration progressing as planned. In the International Distribution segment our $21 per tonne gross margin came in slightly under our expectations because of higher prices for raw materials that were passed through to us from ADM. We have now fully integrated the newly acquired business into our ERP system and expect to have better visibility into our costs going forward. Volumes for International Distribution were higher than expected, and we believe sales volumes and margins will improve through the remainder of 2015.","Moving onto our balance sheet and capital, as Jim noted earlier, we provided substantial insight on our capital plans at our Analyst Day at the end of March, so I won\u2019t go through all that detail again today. I would however like to mention a few key points.","First, our balance sheet remains strong and we are within our stated targeted leverage ratio range. We have approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and currently have approximately $700 million of excess cash. As you know Mosaic has been a very strong generator of free cash flow and we expect that to continue as we reap the benefits of our recent growth investments.","In the first quarter, we distributed $215 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At current prices for Mosaic stock we plan to continue to work down the existing share repurchase authorization. As we noted at our Analyst Day we will discuss additional repurchase authority with our board as we reach the end of our current authorization.","To reiterate our stance on shareholder returns, we have been an active distributor of excess cash to shareholders and are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders in the future. We expect to generate ample free cash flow that will fund future shareholder distributions.","Now, let\u2019s move on to our guidance for the second quarter. Note, that we have slightly widened our volume guidance ranges given the uncertainty Jim mentioned earlier. In phosphates, we expect gross margins to be around 20%, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs. We expect operating rates in phosphates to be in the range of 80% to 85%. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes for the second quarter compared with actual sales of 2.6 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2014. DAP prices are expected to be in the range of $425 to $450 per tonne.","International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 1.4 million tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes with a gross margin of $18 to $25 per tonne. This wider range of gross margin reflects the current volatility of the Brazilian real. We ended the first quarter with an exchange rate of BRL 3.2 to the dollar, and touched BRL 2.9 just this week. Our full-year volume expectations are unchanged.","In potash we anticipate that our mines will continue to operate at high rates to meet global demand, with operating rates expected to be in the 85% to 90% range. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.0 million to 2.4 million tonnes during the quarter, compared with actual sales of 2.5 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2014.","We remain committed to our full-year volume forecast. Average realized potash prices are expected to be in the range of $265 to $290 per tonne, with a gross margin rate in the upper 30% range. We raised Canadian resource tax guidance as a result of both the new tax rules in Saskatchewan and higher expected Canadian dollar gross margins, due primarily to the recent Canadian dollar devaluation. We now expect Canadian resource taxes and royalties to be in the range of $325 million to $375 million for 2015.","Our guidance for full-year brine management expenses remains that $180 million to $200 million. Our expectation for full-year SG&A costs also remains unchanged at $360 million to $380 million. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives across the company and we are ahead of schedule as we work toward our goal of achieving $500 million in savings by 2018.","Our tax rate guidance has changed for 2015 we now expect the full-year effect of tax rate to be in the high teens excluding discrete items. The offsetting impact of the higher Canadian resource taxes on Canadian federal income taxes combined with other items related to our global footprint in business mix is the primary driver of a lower tax liability this year. In 2016, the effective tax rate is expected to return to the low 20% range. The other elements of our guidance, capital expenditures and annual sales volumes for phosphates, potash, and international distribution are unchanged from last quarter. Specifically, we expect robust second-half shipments given the delayed shipments to India, China, and Brazil.","So in short, Mosaic is making measurable progress in our efficiency and operating performance. We continue to be focused on our cost reduction initiatives and look forward to a strong 2015.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jim.","James Prokopanko","Thank you, Rich. Before we take your questions, I would like to provide some insight into the current and near-term market dynamics for potash and phosphates. While we have seen a slower start this year in some regions, our 2015 global demand expectations for both potash and phosphates are unchanged. Our products remain affordable and provide good value for farmers.","Friends in different regions of the world are diverging. So let\u2019s take a quick turnaround the globe. In North America spring planting got off to a late start in the South, but farmers are quickly making progress. With the season just entering full swing, we\u2019ve heard anecdotal reports about cutbacks in applications rates. But we asked feedback from our largest customers indicate that their P&K sales are in line with levels over the last few years and most of the farmer customers are applying P&K at normal or near normal rates.","North American shipments in the first-half of 2015 are expected to be below average. But that is mainly due to higher beginning levels of the dealer inventories. Given the uncertainties about the crop prices, we expect North American distributors will clean out channel inventories this spring and begin to refill bins for fall application only when the outlook becomes a bit clearer.","That, however, maybe about the same time as peak second-half shipments to Brazil and India, which could make a challenging for producers to meet strong demand in the second-half of 2015. In China, demand is underpinned by high crop prices with nearby corn and wheat futures trading at more than $10 and $11 per bushel. Implied MOP shipments climbed to a record last year and are expected to be higher in 2015. It appears that at the current price, demand is accelerating.","The new Canpotex potash contract is a clear indicator of strong demand, with minimum volume commitments significantly above last year\u2019s levels. This volume also reflects our new multiple customer approach in China. While some market observers were disappointed with the contract price, we are satisfied with the netbacks we are receiving from China.","More tonnes sold at respectable netbacks is good news for Mosaic and its investors. We are off to a good start this year in India. Industry potash sales in India are up almost 20% in the first quarter of 2015 despite uncertainty about the government subsidy. This uncertainty will remain until the Indian government publishes its final budget. The rupee has been fairly stable and current phosphate and potash prices continue to make complicated import economics work for importers.","Retailer\u2019s phosphate and potash inventories are at extremely low levels in India, and more imports are needed to restock. In fact, we have sold over 200,000 tonnes of phosphates to India during the delayed North American spring application season, tactical move to balance different market dynamics. This is yet another example of a market leadership role in phosphates. In potash early indications lead us to believe a Canpotex contract will be signed before June.","Also, while we are not counting on an imminent change in the nutrient subsidy system, lower energy prices are clearly providing a tailwind to the Indian budget. As we mentioned at our Analyst Day, we are optimistic about demand growth in India. In the first quarter, Brazil imports were lower than last year, as a result of inventory destocking and currency volatility driving gross to wait to purchase fertilizer until the last minute. We do not see it as an indicator of a decline in demand. Most resilient soil requires potash and phosphates, so if farmers plant they must fertilize.","While on the first quarter of this year, imports of P&K were down 37%. Between now and the rest of the year, we expect Brazil import 11.5 million tonnes of potash and phosphate. The agriculture situation continues to look promising in Brazil, with farmers and sell their products in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions actually benefiting from the weakened real. The market dynamics are quite different from region to region.","Overall, demand for our products from growers is strong. Changes in pipeline and producer inventories certainly don\u2019t always make this fact obvious in the short-term. Mosaic\u2019s boots on the ground presence all these critical markets gives us a competitive advantage. We have firsthand knowledge of in-country market dynamics and the ability to adapt quickly to meet shifting customer needs. We are closely watching the 2015 crop progress and the implications for grain and oilseed pricing, which will influence second-half 2015 and 2016 demand expectations.","With that said a bullish second-half scenario is likely. We wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see an earlier summer fill in North America. Brazil is likely to import more tonnes of P&K in the second-half of 2015 than in 2014. China is expected to import about million tonnes more of potash this year on top of very strong volume growth last year, and India\u2019s appetite for phosphates is ahead of our expectations.","We feel very positive about Mosaic\u2019s ability to succeed in the current environment and across the business cycle. Our investments for growth are generating strong incremental value. We have secured global market access and a significant advantage in North America, and we are demonstrating that Mosaic can and will be one of the lowest cost operators in the industry. In short, we have put Mosaic on a path to growing prosperity and that bodes well for our stakeholders.","Now, we will be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson","Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. My question is about non-Canadian potash imports into North America. Can you just kind of run through how that\u2019s tracking? And then more specifically, can you focus on Belarus. We\u2019ve heard from a Congress that they are trying to block Belarusians potash coming in and we don\u2019t even know if it actually being accepted by farmers. Can you talk a little bit about that too?","James Prokopanko","Well, good morning, Ben. James Prokopanko here. Good to have you on the call. Yes, this year the imports from non-Canadian potash of non-Canadian potash has been higher than we\u2019ve seen in past years. And what the Eastern Europeans are figuring out is that North America is a higher netback market. So we\u2019re seeing those tonnes come to North America, but an important thing to remember is those tonnes that are coming to North America are not going to Brazil, India, and China. So there\u2019s a net balance and we\u2019ll see, if not shortages, tighter supplies going to other parts of the world.","I\u2019m going to have Mike Rahm speak to you about the volumes and what kind of increase we\u2019re seeing from whether it\u2019s the Belarusians or Uralkali and then I may just wrap up with the comments about the issues on the allowance of those products to come into the country. Mike?","Michael Rahm","Okay. Thanks, Jim, and hi, Ben. If I recall the numbers correctly, I think in the period from July\/December, imports from offshore sources were up about between 550,000 and 600,000 tonnes. So that was part of the increase in the stocking of the pipeline during the first semester of the fertilizer year.","James Prokopanko","And, Ben, just on the matter of the permissibility or what your legality of Belarusian imports. That matter isn\u2019t entirely clear. We\u2019ve largely stayed out of it. They were prohibited from - Belarusian product was prohibited from coming into the U.S. And until recently - and there is the belief that it is now permitted, but we\u2019ve not - we\u2019ve not wait into that and we just are standing back from an opinion on that. It\u2019s a hard one to really to give a firm or get a firm answer from authorities about the permissibility of it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong","Thanks for taking my question. So we\u2019ve seen potash cost come down quite nicely over the last two quarters. Could you just maybe go through some of the more details around that and how sustainable that will be going forward?","James Prokopanko","Yes, good day, Andrew. It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m glad you made that observation. We have along with expense reduction initiatives in both SG&A and our phosphate business which are showing results. We\u2019re seeing very good and probably ahead of planned results on our potash. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Joc O\u2019Rourke, our operations leader to speak to that. But this has been something we\u2019ve applied our efforts to over the last 12 months, seeing good results.","What we\u2019re doing simply is stabilizing our production levels. We\u2019ve always maintained a capacity to produce at higher rates than what experience has for demand - has been for the demand. And now we\u2019ve said, look, we\u2019re not going to build a church for Easter Sunday; we\u2019re going to have a preset production level. We may have more capacity but we\u2019re going to staff and man to a level that is going to be more predictable and that is going to result in lower costs.","And so the result is we might not be there to take advantage of a sudden fly up but we are going to be running our facilities at lower predictable rates. Now, I\u2019m going to have Joc just speak to some of the specific things we\u2019ve done to reduce potash production costs.","James O\u2019Rourke","So, Andrew, I think Jim has probably summarized it quite well. Of course, there is a little bit of Canadian dollar tailwind, but the big thing was, first of all, the asset optimization. So shutting down Hersey or selling Hersey and shutting down the potash at Carlsbad was the first big step. Those were our two highest cost producers. We felt we could deliver cheaper from Canada than we could run those plants. So we\u2019ve now done that.","The next piece was as Jim said, was kind of rightsizing the operations. So we had a lot of people to allow for those run-ups, and we\u2019ve now made sure we optimize that. And then finally, a lot of work on just reducing waste, whether that be the number of miners we have running underground or the amount of stuff we have going on around our plant. So it\u2019s pretty simple, blocking and tackling type stuff, but really that\u2019s how we ended up doing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering if you could comment on year-over-year change in crop nutrient tonnes and potash in North America in the first quarter. And that last year you were at something like 1.1 million tonnes and now you are at 572,000 tonnes. And when you look at your competitors\u2019 results, I think they were down something little less than 200,000 tonnes and you are down 500,000 tonnes.","Does this point to a very strong second quarter tonnage result in North America or why the unusual change?","James Prokopanko","Well, good morning, Jeff. This is Caucus [ph]. It\u2019s a good question and we\u2019re ready for it. And I\u2019m going to have Rick McLellan, our commercial leader speak to where that - where those differences are. Rick?","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Sure.","Richard McLellan","Yes, good morning, Jeff. Yes, we expected that we would get a question on this. It has a - it really is a function of our beginning to inventory and what we had in FPDs carried through from 2013. So in 2013, we carried through FPDs that - or inventory in place that became sales. This year, those FPDs got sold in December, and our inventories were low going into 2014. So the big change there is strictly around timing of our FPD programs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","Daniel Jester","Hey, good morning. This is Dan Jester on for PJ. If we can go back to the slide in your presentation where you talk about first-half calendar year shipments of potash and phosphates relative to the second-half for the US, looks like you see second-half potash deliveries about in line with the long-term average, but phosphate shipments is kind of well above average later this year.","So could you just talk about for the second-half why you\u2019re seeing kind of two different outcomes for these nutrients? Thanks.","James Prokopanko","Hello, Don. I\u2019m going to turn this question over about where the split between first- and second-half phosphate sales are to Mike or Rick. Are you prepared to take that question, Mike?","Michael Rahm","Sure, Jim. I can address that, but let me say, at the beginning that the estimates for the second-half are very preliminary. It will depend a lot on where crop prices go; how many acres of corn and soybeans get planted and so forth. But making assumptions about those, I think if you just look at where the seven-year Olympic averages are, I think that kind of explains most of it that we expect that phosphate shipments will be a little bit above the seven-year average. And we also expect potash shipments will be a little bit above the seven-year average as well.","So the main difference I think is just relates to seasonality.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning. I had a couple of questions. First question is about raised your outlook for global potash shipment this year, but up to your own shipment numbers that your largest Canpotex partner is in the exact same thing this morning. So I wanted to know and we have an ICL strike, of course. So I wanted to know why you think you\u2019re gaining this extra volume.","And my second question is talking more about Belarusian imports. Your desire or position here to stand back is that because you\u2019re a proponent of free trade or is that because you no longer have U.S. potash production so your lobbying abilities are diminished or maybe there\u2019s something else there you could do?","James Prokopanko","Hey, Joel, you\u2019re good at getting a couple of questions in and welcome to the call. The first question about the demand, I and Joc commented we are running our facility - our potash operations at ratable capacity and we took couple of our high-cost facilities out. We are running the Canadian facilities at optimal rates in terms of expenses and we continue and plan to continue to do so. In this first-half, we\u2019ve seen following 2014, where the pipeline was fairly well filled with potash. We are now drawing that potash down.","And I think I made it clear in my comments, with a strong second-half to refill and to meet the growing demand we\u2019re seeing in India and China, we think we\u2019re going to go into a tight potash market in the second-half. And there could be some constraints in terms of supply relative to what we anticipate to be higher demand. So absolutely, the market is going to tighten up and with that we are - with a tighter market you could potentially see a higher - and we expect to see higher potash prices.","On the second question about Belarusian, yes, we\u2019re absolutely a believer in free trade. We don\u2019t begrudge anyone that. We believe for the ag markets to work, we have to have free and open trade. So getting into the nuances that go with geopolitics on who\u2019s allowed to come into what countries, we\u2019re standing aside on that for this matter in belief of free trade.","And as I said earlier, if Belarusian or Russian products, additional product comes into North America, that is product that is not going into India, China or Brazil, and we\u2019ll see the market. The balance won\u2019t change and there will be some tightening of supply going into some of these other markets. So we\u2019re - push here, it pops out there, so were not too exercised about the Belarusian product, not at all. And our estimate is, there are only about three vessels of Belarusian product who came here. And if we have a customer in North America that wants to buy a Eastern European potash, Chinese phosphate, there\u2019s Iranian nitrogen, well that\u2019s trifector [ph] of unsecured supplier. So let them buy it. You\u2019ve got Canadian secure producers of potash. I think that\u2019s the right choice for any producers anywhere in the world to buy from.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy Klugman","Thank you. Good morning. So you mentioned that P&K application rates in the U.S. are in line with prior years. But you also noted that potash and there\u2019s more or less than you had thought. How do you think about demand elasticity for phosphate, and has the consolidation that we\u2019ve seen in the domestic phosphate market over the past year impacted this in your view?","James Prokopanko","Hi, good day, Sandy, welcome to the call. Rick, I\u2019m going to just have you comment on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of our farmer demand of the phosphates.","Richard McLellan","Yes, Sandy. Good morning. I think what we saw in potash and with lower prices is, we saw real on the demand - on the ground demand grow in India, in China, as a reflection of that lower price. When we think about phosphates right now pricing is in such a way that it makes sense for farmers to use it on - use phosphates. And we think at with moderating ammonia prices, we\u2019ll see decent margins for our phosphate business going through the rest of the year.","Richard Mack","Hey, Rick, I might add that - I think now for five or six years in a row, and I think this from an agronomic point of view, when you calculate the amount of P&K, that have been removed from the soils by these monstrous crops last couple of years, it really helps to explain why there is a really solid outlook and foundation for P&K demand.","James Prokopanko","I\u2019m going to add onto that, Sandy. There has been a lot of talk about and noise about all farmers are going to cutback, they have to after economize. Let\u2019s just put this into some perspective. If we see a 10% cut, a farmer - typical farmer reduces P&K by 10%, that\u2019s going to save the farmer about $5 an acre.","Now, just to extend that, just take a average yield of sort of mid-average yield of 160 bushels per acre, net price to a farmer for corn is 350 a bushel, that\u2019s $560 an acre revenue a farmer is going to see. Now, do you think the farmers got risk cutting P&K applications by 10% to save $5 or 1.5 bushels of corn, I really think that would be a poor economic in business choice by any farmer to do that. So we are not too exercised by this, and we think farmers are going to make smart economic informed choices, and we just do not see this big cutback in - or much of a cutback if any at all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Donald Carson","Hey, Jim, question on potash pricing. In offshore markets, we\u2019ve seen the China settlement that is a nice base-load volume for producers around the world. But we haven\u2019t seen an Indian contract yet, prices seem to be still slipping in Brazil. So I wondered if you could just comment on the offshore outlook. And then just domestically, would you anticipate a Somerville discount this year, kind of returned to normal practices, is that really what dealers are waiting to see before they restock for the second-half?","James Prokopanko","Hey, Don. Good to hear from you. I\u2019m going to take that first question about India potash and what we expect. I\u2019m going to have Rick speak to the Brazil outlook, having recently been there and in the Somerville market. Yes, we\u2019re still waiting for the India settlement, and hard to say, when that\u2019s going to happen, but we can work back with what we know about just the logistics. The Indians are going to need this product in country sometime in July to get to the - to have it available to farmers sometime in July. They\u2019ve got very low inventories from all the reports we hear from the industry and from our people in the country. So they\u2019ve got to get shipping product to their ports soon.","From Vancouver, it\u2019s just over 30, it\u2019s about 35-day shipping from Vancouver to the Indian ports then you\u2019ve got to get it in country at another 10 days if it moves promptly. So we\u2019re talking about 40 days a month and a half away to have it there in time of July. So if you needed there in mid-July, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re going to have to have this product on a vessel at the port ready to go before the end of May.","So I\u2019m anticipating that the Indians will be booking a contract in the next - sometime early in May, or sometime in May. The price we\u2019ve heard, they are negotiating what\u2019s reported in the trade press with the - Russians are looking for $20 a tonne over last year\u2019s value, we\u2019ll see what it - what the final realization is. But I think the China deal is a good model and we will see India book shortly. Rick?","Richard McLellan","Yes, good morning, Don. I\u2019ll talk about the two things. In Brazil, we\u2019ve seen prices since the Chinese contract stabilized. The issue in Brazil is still about farmer demand. And farmer demand is being impacted by volatility in the currency, longer-term, mid-term, lower or weaker Brazilian real is good for agriculture. And so I think we\u2019ve talked earlier about our expectation of a very strong second-half. And so if you think about what the drivers will be in Brazil, there is only so much logistics capacity to get product into the country and through to the farm.","And that\u2019s going to be challenged the longer farmer waits. And so with the currency situation, we see them waiting, but we have seen potash prices stabilize. As far as a Somerville discount today, I would say, we\u2019re a little too early to talk about how markets will work out for this summer. We\u2019ll have to take a look and see just how much demand is going to come from the rest of the world before we discuss what we\u2019re going to do with prices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Yonah Wiesz from HSBC. Your line is open.","Yonah Wiesz","Yes, hi. Good morning. I\u2019d like to ask a question on sales mix and regional trends in phosphates. In the U.S., we have a bit subdued pricing and demand compared to the higher priced international markets like India and Brazil. I\u2019m wondering how that\u2019s influencing your marketing decisions. I don\u2019t think you\u2019d abandoned the U.S. entirely, but just sales mix in phosphates making a significant shift to foreign markets, and if you are shifting abroad, has there been any secondary sector that impacts on how U.S. purchasers are seeing domestic availability of DAP? Thank you.","Richard Mack","Hi, Yonah. Thanks for that question. And Rick McLellan, o8ur Commercial leader has ready answered.","Richard McLellan","Good morning, Yonah. The prices in North America were \u2013I would say for a while, trending below international prices, which caused us to take a look and say, we need to pull tonnes out of North America. We had existing markets we could go to in India. We did that since that happened, the North American market has popped back up. And so frankly, it\u2019s one of the things that we need to do is look at where we need pressure relief points as a market leader.","And that\u2019s the point that we want to make is that, we\u2019re doing those things, so that we can balance the markets. And since we did that - made that move two weeks ago and announced it, we\u2019ve seen the North American prices rise, as well as some of future swaps markets reflect those changes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher Parkinson","Perfect. Thank you. Just circling back to phosphates, the high end of your phosphate - you hit the high end of your phosphate guide on 1Q despite a lot of activities from the Chinese, Russians et cetera, being acted in 1Q, but prices moderated a little more than many of us expected. Can just comment on your expectation on price trends, as we head into the back of 2Q and into 3Q, particular is, one of your Russian competitors was fairly bullish on pickup in India. So when should we expect that to flow into debt prices?","James Prokopanko","Rick, why don\u2019t you continue with that on the phosphates?","Richard Mack","Yes, we did see prices come down in Q1 reflecting just a later in delayed start to North American demand. I think the one thing to keep in mind is, we\u2019ve seen decreased raw materials. And so sometimes people get excited about the volatility of the price in phosphates, but we need to - what we focus on is looking at what our stripping margin is, which is net of looking at what the margin is going to be. And so as we drive through, we see as we go into Q3, there is some opportunities for our stripping margins or our gross margins to increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Neel Kumar","Good morning. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent Andrews. We were wondering given the strength in the USD. Do you see any change in the international M&A opportunities there?","James Prokopanko","Hello, Neel. So your question is with the USDA\u2019s or U.S. dollar change, are we seeing changes to demand? Well, yes, on phosphate, it\u2019s having an impact, but as the U.S. dollar gets stronger, we\u2019re seeing the price of our grains and oilseeds realized in the case of Brazil to Brazilian farmers, they\u2019re getting more revenue for it. So it\u2019s - that\u2019s a positive, but a relative to our competitors on the dollar and it\u2019s a bit of a headwind on potash, we have a bit of a tailwind. The Russians have a bigger tailwind, but it\u2019s helped our business and marketing as well.","I\u2019m going to have Rich Mack add to that.","Richard Mack","Neel, on the M&A, I would say not really. I don\u2019t think if an opportunity came up, obviously, we would look at the impact at foreign currency fluctuations, would have on that, but it\u2019s not something that we\u2019re particularly focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy Bank of America. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy","Yes, good morning. A few related questions on share repurchases. First, would you advise the amount that you repurchased in the quarter, as well as the remainder on your authorization? And then more broadly, can you discuss your latest thoughts on capacity to recapitalize? I think you mentioned, you have $700 million in excess cash. If you look at your net debt seems to be running about half of a turn of EBITDA roughly. So would seem that you have dry powder so to speak of more than that. I was wondering if you could address that in the context of the correction in the share price. Thank you.","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Kevin, and welcome. Good topical question and our CFO Rich Mack is going to address that for you. Rich?","Richard Mack","Thanks, Jim, and good morning, Kevin. So nothing has changed materially, I think from the extensive information that we provided at Analyst Day at the end of March. Your question how much do we buy in the quarter? It\u2019s about $125 million of stock we repurchased in the first quarter of 2015. And some of the things that I would share with you just from a color commentary perspective is Mosaic\u2019s strong cash flow generation $650 million in the first quarter, which is very positive, and as you noted, we have about $700 million currently of excess cash.","So we have $100 million or $150 million left under our current share repurchase authorization. And we expect that we will exhaust that remaining authorization. As I noted in the Analyst Day events, we will be reviewing the issue of capital, capital management, and additional share authorizations with our board, and we have our Annual Meeting just to note in the mid-May time horizon. So we\u2019ll certainly provide additional updates when we have more information.","We agree with you at current prices. Mosaic\u2019s share price is very attractive. I would note that we have been extraordinarily active in the last 14 months. We have repurchased 60 million shares of Mosaic stock. And with respect to our balance sheet targets, I think I indicated in Florida that our mix on our liquidity buffer are 2.5 billion, that is something that we will continue to review. And the mix between cash and revolver capacity is something that could change over time.","And with respect to our leverage target, we\u2019re comfortable, but it\u2019s something that we continue to look at. I mean, we look at this not on a net debt basis, we look on it - as a rating agency we\u2019d look at it. So on an adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA basis and if we do it that way, we\u2019re at - currently at the high-end of the range, but we\u2019ll work our way down to the low end of the range just with our EBITDA incremental generation here in the next few years.","So the main objective that we have would be practical and capital, a good balance with growth investments and shareholder distributions, and to maintain our solid investment grade credit ratings.","James Prokopanko","Thanks, Rich. I\u2019m just going to - Kevin just reinforce something Rich said. And that is we\u2019ve purchased - repurchased $2.8 billion of our stock since the beginning of 2014. So there\u2019s a little doubt that we know how to do a buyback. And I think you all know that the increase - to do another buyback we need board authorization. And Rich is right to say, we have a AGM coming up. Our board meeting come up - coming up, and this will be pop of the screen topics for our board to consider, so just stay tuned. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yes. Hi, good morning. I just wanted to go through the kind of the cadence about your cost, I look for both phosphate and potash over the remainder of the year. Specifically on phosphate, I mean, how quickly could we start to see some of these lower sulfur and ammonia costs roll through to your P&L? And then on potash, I know historically, you\u2019ve taken more of cutbacks in the third quarter, but it sounds like now you\u2019re going to be running in a more stable operating rates, so would it be fair to you kind of the past profile we saw in the first quarter and from that through? Thank you so much.","James Prokopanko","Hello, Michael, thanks for the question. I\u2019m going to a turn this over to Joc O\u2019Rourke, our Operations leader to address your question.","James O\u2019Rourke","Thanks, Michael. Yes, just let\u2019s hit the phosphate question first. In the next couple of quarters, we\u2019re seeing probably a downward trend on ammonia pricing likely to hit us and probably a flat, when we look at the World Markets, probably a flat sulfur pricing in the next couple of quarters.","In terms of timing, the way that hits us is with moving it through the cost of goods sold, it\u2019s probably a lag period of somewhere between one-and-a-half and three months for that really to show up. So there\u2019s always a little bit of a time lag there. What we would see is the more recent ammonia pricing and we really start seeing that about a quarter away. So next quarter, we should start seeing the impact of that.","In terms of the potash business, generally our shutdowns, our plant turnarounds are held - done in the summer months because of weather and availability. So we wouldn\u2019t see ourselves running at high operating rates in the months of July, August, and September. Those would traditionally be our lower operating rate months. And so our costs will reflect that in those months.","Richard Mack","I\u2019m going to add to that Michael. Our operating costs and raw material costs are important strategic levers that we have a good bit of control over, not entire control over, but we could influence up those costs. And we\u2019ve been working hard to do that. We had back in 2014, we took some curtailment, because we believe that ammonia and sulfur were getting on the line with the pricing of the finished product. And that had the desired impact. We\u2019ve also made investments in a sulfur melter that will be operational towards the end of this year. And that is going to give us some optionality in sourcing sulfur from nontraditional North American markets.","We have the anhydrous ammonia supply agreement with CF industries that\u2019s going to give us a preferred pricing on ammonia. And we\u2019re also looking at debottlenecking our Louisiana ammonia facility again to provide us with some lower-cost ammonia. So you\u2019re right onto ask that question to follow that component, it\u2019s so important in phosphates that would really is the principal financial item to look at is the stripping margin or the gross margin not so much the price when we run that business. So cost big, big deal for us here at Mosaic, and we are really focused on that and doing what we can to keep us in that - to the bottom end of the cost curve.","Richard Mack","With that, I\u2019m going to wrap up the call. Michael was the last question. And I want to, first of all, thank everybody for being on this call today. I know this is a busy earnings day with you and some other people in our space reporting. So I know you have your hands full. I just want to conclude with some of our key messages, I hope you\u2019ve already heard, but we\u2019ll reinforce.","First, Mosaic delivered very good performance for the quarter, and certainly compared to the prior year, we\u2019re really pleased with where the quarter ended. We\u2019re well ahead of last year largely, because the growth investments that we\u2019ve made and the cost-cutting programs are really starting to show a payoff.","Second, we expect 2015 to be good year for both potash and phosphates shipments with strong growing global demand for both our products.","And finally, Mosaic is very well situated - ideally situated, I would say the benefit from the positive secular trends we\u2019re seeing in the ag space and to deliver strong returns to our shareholders.","With that, thanks, everybody, for joining us, and have a safe day.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Mike.","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evident in our earnings so far this year, as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevated channel inventories to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity.","Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High cost production is moving offline and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.","On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016. We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million tons to 66 million tons this year and global MLP shipments will total 59 million tons to 60 million tons, despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers.","Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million tons to 68 million tons and global MLP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million tons to 63 million tons next year.","Several economic and agronomic factors underpins constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee have increased significantly this year.","Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull-down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tons and almost 200,000 tons, respectively, during the first half of this year.","Third, Brazilian demand forecast just keep getting revised higher and higher, despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tons this year, up 10% from forecast just six months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million tons in 2014.","Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in three years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and a relatively stable rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MAP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use. Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remain positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens.","On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are underway today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity as evidenced by the 1.5 million ton decline in DAP, MAP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place and plans outlined at the national phosphate and compound fertilizer industry association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tons of P2O5 or the equivalent of 6.5 million tons of DAP by the end of this decade.","In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower cost facilities in order to compete with producers who have benefited from a collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of six North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tons of capacity.","Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse that keep potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate.","In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high cost capacity is shutting down. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not wildly bullish, we see some positive developments that markets seem to be ignoring or discounting for now.","Joc?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for that insight, Mike. Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with the strong global demand Mike described. While this weak part of the cycle has been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the troughs can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the troughs while enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet so that we can continue to meet our customers' needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value.","We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the five-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost three years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business.","Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.","Third, we are continuing to optimize our assets, so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demands while reducing our cost per ton. With the decision to idle our Colonsay Potash Mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demand with our lower-cost Belle Plaine and Esterhazy mines, as well as our existing potash inventory.","And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employee safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can.","All these decisions have reduced our costs. Our MOP cash production cost per ton came in this quarter at $98 per ton, which included $21 per ton of brine management costs. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash costs came in at $93 per ton, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per ton of brine management costs. This was comparable to last year, despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on this slide.","When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016 with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower costs. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per ton close to $50 when we eliminate brine management costs in the mid-2020s. And Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per ton. As a reminder, we look at our costs excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate, even with lower operating rates.","So, we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities.","In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference.","Now, before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter, as well as our guidance.","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joc. I would like to reiterate the key points made by both Mike and Joc. No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year. Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer, if necessary, and to thrive as market prices improve.","As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer which remains untapped. So we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the cycle.","The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert.","Now, I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per ton. With uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 per ton to $175 per ton, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced export sales.","As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will lead to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million tons to 8.0 million tons of potash. In the second quarter, our Potash gross margin rate was 12%, and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.","In Phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remained strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We expect the gross margin rate in Phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter with additional benefit from lower sulphur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter Phosphate sales is 2.4 million tons to 2.7 million tons.","In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continue to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in the range of 2.1 million tons to 2.4 million tons and a sequential improvement in profitability with the gross margin dollars per ton in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.","We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013 prior to the CF and ADM acquisitions. We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016.","Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management costs from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million. Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016.","To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long desired clarity on China and India potash needs. And along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet and capital management positions and we will adapt as necessary as the business environment evolves.","With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rich. Operator, please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Carl Chen - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. This is Carl Chen stepping in for Ben. Thank you for taking my question. Joc, now that you have lowered your CapEx guidance for the past two quarters, is this largely a function of project ramp-up deferral or is there a cost savings baked in there as well? And how should we think about the K3 ramp-up schedule going forward?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Carl. Good morning. Let me start by describing how we think about CapEx in general. We prioritize all of our capital based on what is most critical to maintaining our operations and of course, what's critical to maintaining the safety of all of our employees. That we certainly will not compromise. What we have looked at is capital that we feel that we can defer with limited risk to operational continuity. It may incur slightly higher costs in terms of operating over a short-term. But we believe that the cash conservation is valuable.","In terms of K3, our thinking has been ancillary equipment, any of those type costs, yes, we will consider. But we are being very cognizant that we want to maintain the critical path of the K3 project. So, on that basis, we're taking out costs we believe we can defer, but making sure we're not compromising the integrity of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a couple of questions on phosphate, if you don't mind. Maybe, first, in the quarter, and you alluded to in the third quarter as well, your rock costs have been higher. Maybe a little bit more clarity about the drivers there. Second, you deferred or you canceled the second ammonia barge related to the CF ammonia contract for next year. Can you talk about what volume capability that gives you under the terms of that agreement, if you can still take the full volumes, or if not, if there's any penalties associated with that? And then finally, on phosphate, just want to get your thoughts on India for the second half and confidence on DAP imports? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Adam. Let me just put these in some order here. Okay. Let me take them one at a time and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick [Rick McLellan] and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long-term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our Phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per ton of mining's decreased at our Four Corners Mine. It's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves. And sometimes those are variable. Sometimes we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect, and other times we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory. And on the long-term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs.","In terms of the ammonia barge, yes, we certainly can move full volumes with one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it, and maybe five years or six years from now when we have to have some statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time where we'll have to come up with different plans. But overall, we believe we've managed the risk very well while still conserving as much cash as we can.","Now, in terms of India's second half, I'm just going to hand that straight over to Mike and let him talk about that.","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Okay. Good morning, Adam. Yes, why don't I give you some numbers and, Rick, you can provide some color commentary here. Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies. And finally, importer margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So, all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tons of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million. That would leave about 3.8 million tons second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country.","And so that's a big number. That's 500,000 tons more than what they did last year which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year. I guess if you put the 3.8 million tons that India has to import alongside the 2.9 million tons we think Brazil needs to import, plus the prospects for a good North American season, we do believe that there will be some pretty strong seasonal pulls on shipments second half of the year.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Got it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. Question on capital allocation, you talked about being positioned to buy assets at the bottom of the cycle. I know you've been looking at phosphate assets in Brazil. I guess the question would be, with the upcoming Ma'aden investment, why would you be looking to expand your phosphate production capability via acquisition, particularly given where your own shares are trading, which would seem to be at a lower multiple of replacement costs than an acquisition might be?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you, Don. Between Rich and I, we'll answer that question. Let me start by saying, we fundamentally believe that some of the best opportunities come at the low part of the cycle. So, we'll continue to look at those opportunities. However, we'll always continue to be prudent with how we manage our balance sheet and our investment-grade balance sheet in particular. We always look for opportunities that add long-term shareholder value. And I think we've said it before, each time we look at those, though, we measure those against the value of buying back our own shares and how that looks for the long-term. So, we'll always take into account our normal capital allocation requirements and priorities and then balance the opportunity against that and the long-term opportunity it gives us.","Rich, do you want to add some color there?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Joc, and hi, Don. The only thing that I would say is, if you go back and you take a look at the history of Mosaic and really even the formation of Mosaic, there are periods of time when there are very strategic assets that do become available for sale and compelling opportunities do arise. And so, that has been our history in a number of acquisitions likely to continue to be our history as we move forward. But I think, as Joc noted, anything that we do has got to have a very high strategic fit, and it goes through a very high bar in terms of an investment analysis. And so, certainly, one of the things that we would look at is the opportunity cost of not repurchasing our own shares.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I guess the last thing to leave this with is, fundamentally, we believe there's room for consolidation in both the Phosphates and the Potash industry, and we believe that there could be some real value-added by that consolidation. So, we're certainly not against consolidation and we think there could be some value-added.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I think in your quarter, your adjusted corporate gross margin was about negative $34 million. Why was that, in that it's much larger than what you had in the first quarter? Why is your tax rate going to 10% and why in the future is there no more Canadian resource tax guidance?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to hand that straight to Rich, because it's a fairly technical question. Did you...","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. I think I got it, Jeff. There's an elimination of profit in inventory in the corporate segment that really relates to the buildup of inventory in Brazil in anticipation of a large season coming up there.","And then with respect to the Canadian resource taxes, the increase this quarter was generally related to a catch-up accrual of about $10 million. And also, you have to take into account where the production is occurring and what the profitability is on a mine-by-mine basis. And so with the shutdown of Colonsay and less production there, more production coming out of Esterhazy and Belle Plaine, in particular, leads to a slightly higher Canadian resource taxes this quarter, which I would expect to fall back to what I'll call more normal levels in Q3 and Q4.","And just as a reminder, this year, year-to-date, Canadian resource taxes are just slightly more than, I'll say, $50 million compared to last year, where they were about $130 million to $140 million.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just offer a little more commentary on your expectations for Phosphate margins as we head into the latter half of the \u2013 second half of 2016, and even into 2017 given the current trends you're seeing in ammonia, sulfur, some of the cost-cutting efforts you've made? But also your expectations for quarterly Phosphate op expenses, just any color would be appreciated. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, three questions if I understand it. Phosphate margins as we head into quarter three and quarter four, and then a look at 2017, is that correct, Chris?","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sure. That's it generally. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then operating expenses, of course.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yes.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I think it's probably best just to hand that straight to Rick and Mike to talk about how we're looking at this next quarter.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yes. I think Mike covered it in his prepared comments, talking about bunching of demand. And as we look at what we've faced so far for margins, we've seen impact from a strong U.S. dollar, deferred buying, and effectively some increased pipeline inventories at our customers' hands. Those have cleaned themselves out, so we expect good North American and South American demand. A good indicator of South American demand is the fact that our Distribution business took $300 million in prepayments from customers for all fertilizer products, which means that farmers there, it underpins the 32 million ton overall demand forecast that we talked about for Brazil. So, as we go through the quarter \u2013 through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter, we see margins improving as demand starts to bunch up in all of those markets; India, Brazil, Argentina and North America.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, do you have any...","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","I guess the only thing I would add is, I think it may get interesting sort of from the middle of September to the middle of November as far as the seasonal bunching. And I think we're beginning to see evidence of a price uplift from demand finally coming to the market. Barge prices have increased. C&F price in Brazil has moved up here recently. And we know that raw material prices for sulfur in the third quarter have come down $5, ammonia prices at $2.70 for August, and we don't see much of a threat in terms of any uptick in those, and potentially more downside as well. So, put that all together and as we said, we're not wildly bullish, but we think that the combination of all of that is going to improve margins as we head into late third quarter and into the first part of fourth quarter.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just sort of pull that together really quickly. Basically, what we're seeing is an increase in demand. So, we see a volume increase, which should lead to better costs in general because of the better usage of our assets. And then in terms of margins, we're probably \u2013 a minor ability to improve from sulfur and ammonia perspective. So, we see the costs being fairly flat to down because of a higher operating rate. And then in terms of going forward into 2017, again, we see this market as fairly well balanced. So, we think 2017 should be a fairly good year for our Phosphate business.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful color. And just very quickly, just most producers that have reported, as well as some of your international peers, have increased North American potash shipments fairly significantly during the first half of the year. And it also looks like you just tweaked or cut your regional guidance on demand a bit. So, can you just comment on what you believe inventory levels are relative to the beginning of the second quarter, and then how you expect this to flow into the summer fill tons and eventually the fall, just any change there? And then also whether or not you've seen an increase in consignment tons. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. I'm going to hand that back to Rick and Mike again to talk about our inventories and regional inventories.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yes. Good morning. I'll start with just saying, what our sales team has come back and reported is that after a very good spring, where buyers bought their last ton of both potash and phosphate, inventories, pipeline inventories in the hands of retailers and distributors in North America have been drawn down. And they're at lower levels than they were last year. We see continued movement in kind of a summer fill program happening right now and prices \u2013 uptake of those have been good in both P&K. And for ourselves, we have agreements with customers where we separate shipment from invoicing our FPD program. And frankly, we're seeing people step in and buy product that's in inventory right now as well as buy product that's coming to them. So, frankly, we see very good, solid position.","Mike?","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Yes, in terms of the numbers, the North American potash market has been a pretty stable market for a long time, despite all of the cries and concerns about cutbacks in application rates. In 2015 calendar year, we think shipments were about 8.9 million tons. And we think this year they'll inch up a little bit to 9 million tons and then drop off back to about 8.9 million tons. But I think the important point there is when you look at imports, imports surged to, by our count, about 1.4 million metric tons in calendar year 2015. Those have come down. We think 2016 will end the year with 1 million tons and probably another reduction in 2017, largely because of the big price discount in North America that's just not as attractive to move tons into North America now. And there are better options with decent demand prospects in other parts of the world.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research. Your line is open.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good morning. You highlighted the strength of the Brazilian agricultural industry. So, can you comment on the credit environment and what type of access to capital Brazilian growers currently have for fertilizer purchases?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Sandy. Let me start by saying we are seeing a great deal of improvement in terms of access to capital. I'm going to hand that to Rick to talk a little more in detail about it. But in general, we're seeing, as you've heard already, we're seeing a really good start to the second half of the year in Brazil, including a record prepay. And that record prepay is a good indication of credit availability.","Rick, do you want to just give a little more color there?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yes. I think that what we're seeing \u2013 no, I don't think. I know that what we're seeing there is at times when the grain market has been where it's at and the currency has been frankly where it's at today, those Brazilian farmers had stepped in because the cost of crop nutrients compared to the price of grain is probably at its best level that it's been in, in the last 12 years. And so, we're seeing farmers step up.","Credit availability in a marketplace like Brazil that's still developing is always going to be an issue. But we don't see any constriction to what we're selling there from a credit availability standpoint.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd just add, regardless of the conditions, they're getting the job done. Our first half shipments of all fertilizer products in Brazil were at a record level, 13.2 million metric tons, the largest amount of fertilizer that's ever been shipped in the first half of the year. So, as we said, despite the political chaos, exchange rate concerns, credit concerns, they're getting fertilizer to the farm.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Jonas.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","A question on the cash generation. Your earnings is almost nothing, yet you generate as much cash as you did last year in this quarter. Can you comment on that?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. We can comment on that, for sure. And I'll hand it to Rich to really give it the detail. But I think, the biggest piece of that is what we've just mentioned. I think some number of $360 million worth of prepay into Brazil is a heck of a lot of cash coming in and really makes a big difference to how we're setting up for the second half of the year.","Rich, do you want to go through the full details on that?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, it's prepay which is a large percentage of it, Jonas. And then it is favorable working capital adjustments during the quarter. But you're right. It led to a very strong cash flow of nearly $600 million.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I don't want to miss taking credit for some of the costs that we've actually reduced and some of the expenditures we haven't made, which again has conserved cash through this period.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you and good morning. Quickly, I have a question on potash and you were expecting potash volume growth of 4% next year, driven by inventory build. And my question is really on China, but can the inventory situation, or destocking, continue next year? I look at Chinese potash inventories and they're down from the peak, but they're still quite high at 2 million tons. And then Qinghai Salt Lake is also adding about 0.5 million ton capacity in 2016 and 2017. So, when you look at that, why do you think Chinese potash import will continue to grow?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, P.J., I'm going to hand a lot of this over to Mike Rahm, who does a heck of a lot of work on the world S&D for potash, obviously. But we do see a rundown of Chinese inventory over this year. We continue to see more product go to the actual ground, which is \u2013 what gets shipped is one thing. What actually gets used to produce crops is really what matters in the long-term. So, we do see China's need for potash fertilizer in particular continuing to grow, and they will have to supply that in the years to come as they have in the years past.","But with that, I'm going to hand it to Mike to talk about the details of the S&D.","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Okay. Good morning, P.J. Yes, China, as you know, is a big complicated country. And frankly, I think there's something going on there in terms of potash consumption. I think all the numbers would suggest that maybe potash consumption is a little bit better than everyone is giving China credit for.","Just to review some of the numbers, China imported a record 9.4 million tons last year. We think they've produced about 6.6 million tons and shipments, probably in that 16 million ton range. So, there's a little bit of an inventory build last year. We think that's getting pulled down. Our shipment number this year is 12.9 million tons. We think it'll increase to 13.9 million tons next year. So, imports, we think imports this year probably will be in that 8 million ton range, so down from last year, and it probably stays in that range in 2017.","The other factor, you mentioned Qinghai Salt Lake, our team in Beijing believes that production has dropped this year, probably closer to 6 million tons to 6.2 million tons. So, while there's some additional capacity coming on, I think there's been some adjustment in terms of domestic production in response to the current price environment as well. But I think the bottom line is we don't have a record shipment number factored in for China next year. And we think the imports are going to be relatively stable at about 8 million tons.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me just talk a little bit about the port inventories, which I think you mentioned at 2 million tons. I believe our last number was about 1.8 million tons. But remember, 1 million tons of that is in bonded warehouses, which will now get turned into sales fairly quickly. So, the actual port inventory of non-bonded warehouses isn't as high as all that. And the other thing you have to consider in China is upcountry inventory, which I think can play a big, big role in this. And what we're hearing from both our own distribution team and from Canpotex is those upcountry inventories are certainly being depleted now. So, thanks, P.J.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. When would you make a decision whether Colonsay would be ramped back up for 2017? What would be the factors around it? It seems like, considering some of the different things going on in the industry, the Rocanville proving run, the legacy ramp, your demand projection, you might not need the Colonsay tons for some time.","And a second question as well which would be, you did not lower your dividend like one of your Canpotex partners did last week. You're running maybe around 200% payout ratio right now. What would have to happen for you to revise your dividend? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Joel, thank you for those questions. First, Colonsay, I mean, Colonsay's decision is clearly how do we meet our customer needs while optimizing our overall cost and cash output. So, we'll have to make another decision on Colonsay towards the end of the year. Our expectation at this stage is we will bring it up in January as per what we've previously announced. I mean, really the deciding factor there will be how much we think we'll need for our spring season and how well-positioned we are at the end of the year for that spring season. But at this stage, we're expecting we will bring up Colonsay in January.","In terms of the dividend, look, at this point, we don't plan to cut our dividend as you've said. We see the fundamentals improving in the second half of the year which mitigates the need for a dividend cut. Now, if the markets don't improve or if they deteriorate, we may have to revisit the affordability of our dividend.","However, just let me point out in the first half of the year, we generated sufficient cash to cover all of our commitments including capital and our dividend. So, our $1 billion of cash is still intact and our $2.5 billion liquidity buffer is still intact. So, we don't see an impending need to review our dividend at this stage. We leave that open that we may in the future. And, Rich, do you want to just add anything to that?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, I would just say, Joel, that obviously it's something that we closely monitor and we'll continue to closely monitor in the future, Joc noted. And we have a conservative liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion. Interestingly enough, we've never really dipped into the liquidity buffer in our history, and we've got over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And at the same time, we're reducing our cash spend. So, we're lowering our capital, we're reducing our SG&A. We're maximizing working capital as much as we possibly can. And so this is something that we'll continue to review, obviously with the mindset of maintaining a solid investment-grade credit rating going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Could you remind us on some of your CapEx requirements? How much is left for Esterhazy K3 and what's the timing and CapEx requirements for phosphate mine development? I don't think we've had an update on that in a while. And then just on your targeted leverage ratios and what that level currently is? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. So, first of all, CapEx. We are in the process today of looking at all of the opportunities and possibilities around a new phosphate mine. I think our latest says that we will need to have that in place by, I think, the 2023 type timeframe. So, certainly, we're in the planning phase now. I'm trying to go back to our last Investor Day, where I believe we said the cost of that would be circa $600 million now that we're expanding South Pasture Mine rather than building a brand new Ona Mine.","In terms of the capital requirements left for K3, we are largely finished the shaft sinking on K3. Our incremental cost going forward, not including what we save in taxes because of the write-downs of capital, would be in the range of $600 million. And those are for mine development, infrastructure and conveyor ways between K3, K1 and K2.","In terms of our leverage targets, I'm going to hand that straight over to Rich to give the details.","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Andrew, our leverage targets, as stated, are roughly between 1.5 times and two times. But keep in mind that that is kind of a through-cycle target. And so, at any given point, you're going to have a spot leverage ratio that may be higher or lower than that. And so, we look at it on a through-cycle basis. Right now, we're slightly higher than the upper end of that range, but when you take a look at it as a rating agency would look at it over, call it, a three-year to five-year period of time, we're comfortable with where we're at right now, and obviously we're at the bottom end of the cycle.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just following on the K3 comments, does the goal of cutting CapEx influence how you're thinking about that transition or managing it? Are you looking to speed it up or slow it down, or is that still up in the air?","And then the second question, do you anticipate spending more on the Brazil distribution build-out near-term? I just wonder if you could give us an update there and let us know whether you're still seeking to expand?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Mark. Thank you. So, first of all, let's talk about K3 and then move on to Brazil. What we've said today is we will continue on the critical path of K3. So, the big thing right now is finishing the shaft sinking, build the loading pockets, build the infrastructure, so that we can start mining at K3. How fast we ramp that up greatly depends on market conditions and what the needs are for product at that stage. So, that I think is going to come in a couple of years when we really know what's going on there. But in general, I would say if times are tougher, it would push you more towards moving from K1 and K2 to K3 earlier to reduce the brine inflow costs. But I think that decision is a ways out.","In terms of Brazil distribution, we believe our footprint right now is pretty strong in Brazil. We like where we stand. Over the longer-term, we can see ourselves expanding into the Northwest into areas of Mato Grosso and towards the northern region, towards Amazonia. But in the near-term, the only expansion plans that we will consider is if we need to expand our port capacity at Paranagu\u00e1, which we may feel we need for good logistics.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from UBS. Your line is open.","Edlain Rodriguez - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick question. Before you've talked about the potential for potash prices to move higher in the near-term, so, like how does the softness in crop prices play a role in farmers' reluctance to either pay up or not, especially in the U.S.?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Edlain. Let me start by just highlighting that, certainly, lower crop prices does impact at least the psychology of fertilizer. Having said that, fertilizer's very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer to crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact \u2013 the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil. And so, that in itself tends to drive higher demand.","The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S. for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres and so likely for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well.","So, with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Yes. I think that's a good question, and certainly a concern that we have and monitor. I think one of the things, we had a very good run in prices in June and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that, as well as probably forward priced some of their 2016 crop. So, I don't think you want to focus too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly and that's impacting prices now, but there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Ni\u00f1a event and the negative consequences that typically has towards Southern Hemisphere harvest.","So, if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat-focused and the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those three crops. For phosphate, it's about 40%. So, the fact that you're seeing dramatic increases in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. A question on Brazil for 2017 for potash and phosphate volume, how much do you expect it to increase if you expect it to increase at all next year? And are you assuming that the current very attractive soft commodity prices there in local currency stay intact for next year?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Vincent. I'm going to hand a lot of this over to Rick. But let me start by saying, we expect to see the growth of agricultural output and as such, the use of fertilizers to grow at about a 5% per year in Brazil over the next number of years. So, we expect that to continue.","And in terms of the softness and the underlying prices, most of the projections show a continued weak real or even a weakening real, which all bodes very well for the economics of farming in Brazil. So, we expect 2017 to be another good year. I don't have the exact numbers. Mike can give you those. But in terms of ongoing growth, we expect 5% a year for the next number of years.","Mike, do you want to give the specifics there?","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Yes. Good morning, Vincent. Yes. We see the demand continuing to grow in Brazil. We're projecting potash shipments of about 9.1 million tons this year, increasing to 9.4 million tons next year, and of that, imports going from 8.5 million tons this year to 9 million tons next year. So, very good demand prospects there. We see the real probably remaining fairly stable. And yet the local currency prices of the key crops in Brazil remaining attractive and causing more acreage and decent input usage.","In the case of phosphate and in terms of import demand, we think imports of DAP, MAP, NPS and TSP will go from about 5.2 million tons this year to 5.6 million tons next year. And so, yes, there's nothing at this point that we see that sort of derails the growth trajectory that we're seeing in Brazil.","I don't know, Rick, do you have any comments?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","The only thing \u2013 I'd go back to something that Joc mentioned, and it's really around farmer economics. At today's grain prices, despite them softening and the currency where it is, returns for this crop that will be planted and harvested \u2013 planted this fall and harvested in January, February, are very, very good. And the prospects for the 2017-2018 crop are just the same. So, that really underpins demand. Farmers needing the product to get the yields that they need, plus having good, solid economics.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, we only have time for one last question and then close this call. So, Yonah, I think it's Yonah that's up next.","Operator","Yonah Weisz, your line is open.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)","Hi. Thank you very much for taking my question. I guess, perhaps, talking, you mentioned about Brazil and the improving environment there, which has really occurred for the most part of this year. I'm just wondering why you don't think there's been more leverage on that in actual potash pricing, even though demand appears to be fairly healthy?","On the same note, if you talk about bunching of demand into 2H 2016, why is your phosphate price or DAP price range at the top of its range flat with current pricing and actually shows a potential for a drop in 10% to $310 per ton?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Yonah. So, we'll hit these one at a time. First of all, Brazil, I think we are seeing some potash improvements in terms of near-term pricing in Brazil. There's been some $10, $20 up in the last couple of weeks. And we expect that to continue as we get closer to their main planting season. I'll let Rick and Mike just talk about that quickly.","And the next question is, why is pricing flat despite the bunching? I mean, we would hope for an improvement in both margin and pricing in the second half. But we need to see the demand first and then the price will follow.","Mike Rahm - Vice President of Market and Strategic Analysis","Yes, Yonah, good morning. We said there's some bunching in the second half. We think that the impact on price probably doesn't show up in spades until probably the \u2013 maybe the second half of September. I talked about things probably getting interesting from the second half of September through the first half of November. And that's when peak demand is going to be hitting in terms of shipments into the big markets, whether it's India, Brazil, North America. And so, I think that's reflected in our third quarter price projections.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","The only thing I can add, in Brazil, you've seen for the first half of the year deferred buying. In the second half, they can't defer it anymore. Inventories are used up. And so, that's where we see some price momentum in Brazil both for P&K.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, to conclude our call, I just want to reinforce our key points. The business environment remains tough, but we see signs of stability and improvement. We expect strong global demand and modest improving prices in the second half of the year. At Mosaic, we're taking the necessary actions to withstand the current environment and thrive when the markets do improve. We're conserving cash by cutting our costs and our capital spending. We are continually looking for opportunities to create shareholder value now and into the years ahead.","So, thank you very much for joining us.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company concludes the prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon?","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal year 2013 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will share our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will discuss capital management, as well as provide insight into our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on managements\u2019 beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date, March 28, 2013, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now I would like to turn it over to Jim.","James Prokopanko","Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings discussion. The quarter played out essentially how we expected it would. The potash we opened with products flowing once again to India and China and those flows facilitated increased demand in North America late in the quarter. At the same time, the phosphate market remained in balance.","As you are well aware, our fiscal third quarter, which typically was slowest of the year. So this morning, we will focus more on our outlook than on the quarter. Before we get to that, I will review the numbers quickly. For the quarter, we reported operating earnings of $419 million on net sales $2.2 billion, both up slightly over a year ago.","The potash business unit contributed $216 million in operating earnings and the phosphate business unit contributed $197 million. In total, we reported earnings per share of $0.81, or $0.88 per share excluding the notable items, compared with $0.64 a share a year ago. We generated $371 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and we continue to maintain a strong cash position with $3.3 billion of cash on hand.","Now, I'll spend some time on our overview. First, agricultural fundamentals remained strong around the globe. This bodes well for the world's growing population and also for Mosaic. Even with the expected bumper crop in Brazil and other parts of South America, food supply is fragile. As a result, farmers preparing for spring in North America, have many incentives to plan every available acre and to ring out maximum yields from every field.","Commodity prices have declined modestly as futures markets recognize the potential for a big 2013 crop. The prices remain high relative to historical norms. In part, that's because many analysts do not expect yields to return to the trend level this year and because there were significant pent up demand world-wide for grains and oil seeds. We share that point of view. In fact, while there are a number of potential outcomes for the 2013-2014 crop, the likely place from our advantage point builds back only one-half of the inventory drawdown this year leaving commodity prices at elevated levels.","And, I would remind you that agricultural commodity forecasters were signaling similar expectations at this time last year and farmers responded by planting 96 million acres of corn in North America. As we all know, the big anticipated crop withered and prices left to new heights. Farmers nevertheless delivered the second largest global crop in history last year and the world still consume more grains and oil seeds than it produced. So, my message is this, the world needs everything that agricultural land can produce while volatility will always exist in our markets, this simple fact more people need more food will not change.","So, our outlook for the long-term remains strongly positive, even as we face challenges. Of course, the challenges are ever changing. Three months ago, we had no potash contract with India. We just completed a protracted contract negotiation with China and lower Mississippi River levels with threatening the supply chain. All those issues have now been resolved.","To help you understand the challenges we face today, I will describe in more detail the dynamics affecting the potash and phosphate markets. In potash, the market is on track to reach our forecast for global shipments in 2013. In fact, we believe shipments will reach the upper end of our expected 55 million to $57 million ton range. The contracts with India and China, provided a better-than-expected base load for demand. Established a floor for prices and should reduce inventories to low levels. The expectation of a strong spring planting season further improved short-term sentiment.","Our operating rates reflect the improved conditions. Mosaic's potash mines operated 78% of capacity during the quarter, and we expect operating rates to increase in the fourth quarter as we continue to meet the better-than-expected demand from China and India. We expect potash prices to remain in the current range until we see how fundamentals play out later this year. Our 3 million tons of ongoing potash expansions are proceeding as planned. Overall, they remain on budget and on time. That said, we are continuing to evaluate the remaining 2 million tons of expansions and expect to make a decision to proceed or delay sometime this calendar year.","The phosphates' market remains balanced. We are seeing outstanding demand in the western hemisphere, and as supply has tightened, we have seen Tampa export prices improve by $50 per ton from their lows. The story is more difficult in Eastern Hemisphere, where Indian subsidy policy continues to hurt soya health and fertilizer sales. We don\u2019t expect the Indian buyers to come back to the market until the end of our fiscal 2013.","Longer term, out outlook for the phosphate business is positive as the joint venture we announced last week illustrates. We are thrilled that Ma\u2019aden invited us to participate as an equity partner for their second phosphate project, validating our technical knowledge, industry expertise and positive global reputation. It is important to highlight that this new project has long been incorporated into industry supply expectations.","This investment has many benefits for Mosaic. It supports our growth strategy and partially meets the growing demand from our international distribution operations. It is expected to generate attractive returns. It gives us access to very low cost phosphate production. It provides more cost-effective access to India and other Asian markets. It gives us opportunities to participate in future Ma'aden expansions and it further diversifies our sources of products.","It's important to note that this project is part of our phosphate growth strategy and does not change our plans for our Florida and Louisiana phosphate business. The rock and fertilizer we produce in the U.S. remain critical to Mosaic and to the world's farmers. Once the Ma'aden operations are in production, which we anticipate to begin in late 2016. We also would be able to allocate more of the domestic production to North America and South America. In turn, we should be able to generate higher netbacks from these operations. Our domestic facilities will also continue to be the source of our innovative higher margin MicroEssentials product.","Before I call upon Larry, I would like to highlight some recent external recognition we have received. For the second straight year, we were named to the Ethisphere Institute's list of the world's most ethical companies and we are the only large agricultural company on the list. We are proud of this achievement because it demonstrates that we are living up to our values of excellence, integrity, sustainability and connectivity.","Now I will ask Larry to talk through our thoughts on capital allocation and provide updated guidance. After that, I will conclude with some further thoughts on the outlook. Larry?","Lawrence Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim and good morning. We have been traveling to meet with investors frequently over the past few months and we put one refrain rise above all others. You want to understand our capital allocation policies and just what we intend to do with our balance sheet. So rather than go through our quarterly numbers in detail, I will provide as much insight as I can on capital.","We have been working to refine our financial policies to align them with the updated strategic priorities we revealed last fall and to ensure that we effectively operate as a fully independent company following the final completion of the Cargill transaction. The policy work is nearly complete and we are planning to provide more detail before the end of the fiscal year. In the meantime, I can give you some previews.","While we will always seek to retain our investment grade ratings and a reasonable liquidity cushion, you should expect a substantially more efficient balance sheet in the future. By more efficient, I mean we would carry less cash and more debt. To get to that more efficient balance sheet, we would like to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases which become possible when tax restrictions expire in late May.","To remind you, there are 129 million Class A restricted shares in three tranches, each with 43 million shares. These tranches are expected to be sold or convert to common in each of the next three years beginning this summer. It is possible but by no means a given that we could negotiate an accelerated release of all of those shares. Our initial focus will be on the first 43 million shares per the existing agreement.","We look forward to initiating discussions regarding those shares this summer.. We have the financial flexibility both available cash and unused debt capacity and importantly, the desire to consider a repurchase of some or all of those shares, as well as other options The repurchase of shares in the open market becomes an option once put off related restrictions fall away in November.","It is important for you to understand that we cannot engage in any discussions regarding the restricted shares for another two months, and we may not have a resolution or agreement until later in the summer.","Turning to financial flexibility, note that our quarter end cash balance stood at $3.3 billion and we expect strong cash flow generation in our fourth fiscal quarter to further increase our cash available for repurchases. However, there are some existing calls on our cash or debt capacity, and I would like to remind you of a couple of our previous comments and ongoing 10-Q and 10-K disclosures.","First, we believe a reasonable liquidity buffer will include approximately $750 million in cash as well as available committed lines of credit. Second, we have also disclosed that a portion of our cash would be taxed if repatriated. Today that cash totals approximately $600 million exposed to a 35% U.S. tax rate with both, the cash and income statement impact. This cash is available without penalty to fund non-U.S. investments such as the Ma'aden joint venture and provide a portion of our liquidity buffer.","Finally, in connection with the [enforcement] matter that has been ongoing for several years, we may choose to establish a trust to pre-fund existing phosphate asset retirement obligations, which would result in a restricted cash balance of approximately $600 million. This would be simply funding in an existing liability and would have no P&L impact. Note that we may elect to fund the trust by issuing debt given attractive borrowing rates. This matter has not yet been finalized and likely will not reach a conclusion until the end of this calendar year.","All told of course, we have substantial cash and borrowing capacity and we look forward to deploying it. After achieving our targeted balance sheet, our cash flow priorities will not change. Our first priority will continue to be investments for organic growth like our current committed potash expansions, which are expected to produce strong long-term returns for shareholders. Second, as our joint venture with Ma'aden demonstrates, we seek strategic investment opportunities. As always, we will only enter into an acquisitions or joint venture if we believe the transaction meets our return hurdles and fits with our strategy and culture.","To summarize, Mosaic is in excellent financial condition and we clearly understand the significant opportunity and importance of returning capital to shareholders. Your patience is much appreciated as we work through our complicated but ultimately constructive process. I want to repeat, do not look for a transaction announcement from us in late May as that is only the kickoff date for discussions with the other parties to any transaction.","Now, I will turn to guidance. We expect fourth quarter potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tons, compared with actual volumes of 2.0 million tons in the fourth quarter of last year. If we reach the top end of this range, our potash shipments would set a new quarterly record. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $350 to $380 per ton, which reflects a substantially higher mix of lower priced standard product. The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the range of 40% to 45%. Clearly, this would be a step down from prior years as higher operating rates are expected to be offset by lower prices.","While we continue to aggressively focus on expense management and maintaining our cost curve positions, year-over-year margins are also being impacted by higher depreciation as we bring our new capital investments online and higher labor costs as we have staffed up for a new capacity. Our operating rate in potash during the fourth quarter is expected to be above 85%. Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million for the year. And phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.6 million to 2.9 million tons for the final fiscal quarter of the year, about in line with last year's volumes. We expect our realized prices for that to range from $475 to $505 per ton, roughly in line with the prior quarter. We also expect the gross margin rate to be about flat with the third quarter. Mosaic's phosphates operating rate is expected to exceed 85% of capacity during the fourth quarter.","Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. Here in North America, the searing drought of 2012 lingers in some regions. But these early days of spring are bringing renewed optimism and farmers are planning for an abundant crop. If you are concerned that I am on the verge of tearing up over bird stripping and seedlings reaching for the Sun, worry not. Solid economics lie at the heard of the expectations for a big crop. Grain and oilseed prices remain elevated for many reason. Weather conditions and government policies, for example but none as important as old-fashioned supply and demand.","In 2012, the world once again produced less grain and oilseed than are consumed despite the second largest global crop on record. You know the numbers. 9 billion people by 2050, a net addition the 75 million people per year and very little expected increase in land-use for agriculture. Demand is on a steady line pointing upwards and food production has got to keep up. The world's farmers simply cannot beat the population without good crop nutrition.","As we have seen recently, short-term volatility in prices and in supply and demand will always exist in our complex global markets. But the short-term does not change our story, our promise or our mission. We are well on our way to being the world's leading crop nutrition company and that is an enviable and encouraging position for all our constituents. It is also a stern responsibility. Helping the world grow the food it needs is no small task but Mosaic of the global reach and the expertise to make an important contribution to deliver benefits to global food security while delivering rewards for our shareholders.","Now we would be happy to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thanks and good morning, everyone. If you could just talk about, if you evaluate the potash expansion is not board approved yet, what do you need to see going forward? What are you going to analyze or what are the big decision points which are going to make you decide either to go forward or not go forward?","James Prokopanko","Good morning, Vincent. Jim Prokopanko here. Good to have you on this call. You are right. We are taking that under final consideration now. We are looking and I will ask Joc to add a few comments but principally a matter of what the cost you are looking like, concluding our final cost outlook, as you would be aware, Saskatchewan is a hot economy with all the energy and other basic serial industries moving. So we are seeing some cost pressures come into these projects. So on the matter of the final cost, to build out the projects we still have on the drawing boards and take a look at where some these other projects in the industry are going. You have seen some changes in the plant outlook. Vale has backed away from its Rio Colorado project for reasons of cost that have gloomed on them and take a final look and balance by the end of the summer. Joc, do you want to add anything?","James O'Rourke","I think the only thing I could add is we are in the process of finalizing the cost, looking at the construction environment in Saskatchewan but the key thing for us, and as we have always said, that these projects have on rounds and off rounds. I do think it\u2019s a matter of if we are going to do the projects. It\u2019s a matter of what's the right timing for Mosaic so if we make a decision, it will be on timing. So we will be talking about delaying not finally cancelling a project.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions about PhosChem and India. What I want to know is, it seems like you are giving guidance that you don\u2019t expect the Indian import market to really return until the end of your fiscal year. So around May. We have seen some spot deals happening in India. So is your sense that the Indian market is changing its gear to more spot for DAP and it's part of that also longer-term. What's the feature of PhosChem with you now investing in Ma'aden project and maybe changing how you market around the world. Thanks.","James Prokopanko","Morning. India, I am going to ask Rick to address, but I'll just leave off with we are seeing a recovery in the Indian economy. There's definitely some impacts, negative impacts from the changes in their subsidy program, but we've seen a good return to potash demand. The phosphate is a little iffy. And I am going to ask Rick to speak to that.","Richard McLellan","Yes. Good morning, Joel. So your two questions, the first on PhosChem in India, I think that we will see longer-term contracts entered into in India, so we are not seeing a change to a spot market. Our guys were there last week, visited with them. There is belief in three things the inventory they have will carry them through until probably near June.","Second that to get product moving into place, so that they can take the 5.5 million roughly tons of DAP. They need for imports will lead the start May and everyone is sitting there waiting for the government to come forward with what the subsidy programs are going to be. The expectation was is that those were to be last week. Expectation now is, is that we'll see them next week as the government itself set after some up people. And so we expect India will come in. It will be of orderly buy and there is no question they want the tons that we have allocated towards them.","The second part on PhosChem is a question that we have been asked, but I think the key thing is, as we see no changes coming and that the to think about it, product that will come from Ma'aden is four years out. That's a long time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bill Carroll with UBS.","Bill Carroll - UBS","Once the Ma'aden JV get scaling, how much you geographic phosphate mix change? That is do you expect the Ma'aden output to go mainly to India and Asia, while the Florida and miss key [mile] our product will be market predominantly in north and south America and then how much might be the overall phosphate cost structure changed because of the new project?","James Prokopanko","Rough connection on your question.","I think, what I heard on the first part of the question was, what is going to happen with the Ma'aden tons come on. As Rick mentioned, there's going to be four years off. Those tons are going to be cost advantage given this location into Asia. What that would do is leave more Mosaic products available in North America and the western hemisphere and then to Latin America. Now, it's not all going to be run purely that way. The tons don't all move in one lump sum to one geography, they move all year long, so it's generally going to be Ma'aden directed to Asia, cost advantage for freight reasons. Our tons, there's nobody yet to play in phosphate cheaper onto Latin America or North America in the Mosaic camp.","The next question is about the cost structure. I am going to ask Larry to talk about that.","Lawrence Stranghoener","One of the great appeals of the Ma'aden investment is that, we believe we will be investing in what will end up being the lowest cost phosphate production operation in the world. And in this business, as you know, being at the low end of the cost curve ultimately wins and so that was a key part of the strategy for us. We're delighted with the partnership we've struck with Ma'aden and with SABIC, and we believe this project will generate very good returns for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA. Your line is open.","Kurt Schoen - CLSA","Thanks. This is Kurt Schoen filling in for Mark. Do you expect the logistical issues in the ports in South America to any way affect your fertilizer shipments?","James Prokopanko","Hello, Kurt. With Rick McLellan, having just back from Brazil last week. He is the best answer to that.","Richard McLellan","Yes, good morning. Really good question. I don\u2019t think until you get to Brazil, you fully understand the logistical issues that are being faced there. To your question about will it, first I will describe what I saw and what I heard. I had a chance to visit to get to our Paranagu\u00e1 facility and the truck lineups there which are normally long in harvests, like we are in right now are much worse than they were other years. Then I happened to visit with a farmer who was probably 400 kilometers from the port. His trucks had been in line for, I think, it had been seven days and he did not expect them to move for another two days.","There was some real gridlock going into the ports and its causing some extremely increased costs for both the farmer and people operating there. T think the one thing that\u2019s good about what we see happening with the Brazil market is that people believe that the market is going to be a big market and so the buying is being much more spread out than it was last year. They realized they cant just come in and expect just-in-time shipments.","So there a positive outcome of that. The issue though is, is that Brazil needs significant investment in ports, in real capacity and in roads. It is clear that the government understands that but taking it to action is going to be something that\u2019s going to have to happen for them to continue to grow like they have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","Thanks, good morning. I was hoping to get some color on the fiscal fourth quarter phosphate margin guidance. At the midpoint of the range you have guided volumes up sequentially and prices really only down $5 a ton. You have also outlined an outlook for lower ammonia costs and lower sulfur costs, at least based on your purchase, the purchase cost that you realized in the fiscal third quarter coupled with what more another quarter of optimized (inaudible) production. Maybe break how phosphate margins are so only flat sequentially in the fiscal fourth quarter? Thank you.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Adam, its Larry. All of the trends you mentioned are true and yet they are not strong trends. So what we are seeing is the likelihood of relatively flat performance in phosphates in the fourth quarter. Prices may be down slightly. You are right. Ammonia cost maybe down slightly. We are continuing to see progress on rock cost but when we put the whole mix together, what we are seeing is the likelihood of relatively flat gross margins.","As you know, some of the raw material cost trends take some time to work through their way fully through the P&L. So while we are pleased by the trends we are seeing, we don\u2019t expect to see the full impact of those fairly recent trends already in our fourth quarter P&L fully. So positive directions but perhaps not as many fold changes as we might like to see just in this coming fourth quarter","Operator","Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar with Citi.","PJ Juvekar - Citigroup","Yes, hi good morning. The issues with Ma'aden one was that some of the rock quality was quite poor due to impurities which caused Ma'aden one to ramp up slowly. So what can you tell us about Ma'aden two project and the rock quality there? How does it compare to your Florida or pro mines and does this impact your Miski Mayo two expansion. Thank you.","James O'Rourke","Very good to have you on the call. Good to hear from you. We cant really say much about Ma'aden one. We have not had involvement in that, engagement in that and its best to ask the Ma'aden folks how that\u2019s coming along. It\u2019s a 3 million ton plant. I can tell you that. Our sense is that producing in that 2 million ton a year range and I have little doubt that by the end of this calendar year or sooner they are going to have the capacity if they choose to run it at the 3 million ton range. The Ma'aden two mine is a separate project, part of the investment we are making along with the granulation plant and until we start developing that mine, we won't know for certain, but I am going to ask Joe to speak to some of the issues that we may face in mining.","James O'Rourke","Hey, Jay basically we are just starting out in terms really evaluating long-term processing the rock and everything, so a lot of rock quality isn't what necessarily in how you process it, so I think that's one of the things that Mosaic will bring to the table. We experienced with a range of rocks and rock types and also a range of experiences with respect to how to process that rock into final product. So, in terms the raw quality, we see rock quality is good from what we've seen so far. It's not the same as quality, it's different but in some areas it's better, some areas it's not as good as Florida, but all rocks are slightly different.","Second part of your question in terms of what does it mean for Miski Mayo, I recognize that Miski Mayo is a rock mine which supplements our Florida operations, so the Miski Mayo is quite separate we will be producing phosphate product like DAP, etcetera, where at Miski Mayo, we use the rock for Florida operations, so they really don't compete in that sense or they have a fairly separate strategic purpose for Mosaic, so we are committed to diversifying our rock sources in Florida and if the economics and the long-term focus Miski Mayo supports that commitment to Florida, we may go ahead with it despite Ma'aden.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","You mentioned you are seeing some improving sentiment in most of your geographies. Can you add some more color in which geographies in particular you this in for potash and where are you seeing the biggest material differences versus what you've seen in January? Thank you.","James Prokopanko","Good day, Chris. I am going to ask Mike Rahm and Rick McLellan. Mike Rahm, our economist strategy leader to speak to that.","Mike Rahm","Good morning, Chris. Generally it's been wide spread improvements in most geographies. As you probably know, we are guiding total MLP shipments in the range of 55 million tons to 57 million tons nearly through the first quarter of calendar year 2013. Our estimates are now at the high-end range of the range.","Starting in the Americas, we're seeing just outstanding shipments and in North America this past fall. The middle, the quarter here in the December, Jan, February, it was a little bit slower. We saw an uptick late in the quarter. Prospects for our final fiscal quarter as we've indicated guidance are very good. Brazil is probably going to [with] 8 million tons of imports this year and some of the Asian markets after a big drop-off in Indonesia and Malaysia, we think there is a very good rebound there.","And if you look at the two big contract markets like China, first half China, if you include the option tonnage has contract for about 3 million tons by vessel, and if they continue to import 200,000 tons to 250,000 tons per month by rail, you can add up about 4 million tons to 4.5 million tons of imports by China in the first half of the year, and I think that either indicates they are front-end loading their purchases or maybe we're on the brink of seeing China break out of that 6 million tons to 6.5 million ton important appetite","And even in India. India contracted for close to 4 million tons of product and we have guided I think in the past 3.2 to 3.7 with the 3.5 midpoint estimate or point estimate. And then so, even India is exceeding our expectations in terms of contracting. So, put that all together, I think the probably an underappreciated story is the emergence of a very strong rebound in global potash shipments in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kevin McCarthy, Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Yes. Good morning. Larry, if you look a couple of years ahead, let's say, beyond the Cargill trust episode in Mosaic's history, is there a particular leverage ratio or range of leverage where you would feel comfortable striking a balance between running the balance sheet more efficiently and maintaining your investment grade status with the one times EBITDA in terms of net debt or two times or somewhere in between? How would you evaluate what is appropriate to maximize the efficiency?","Mike Rahm","Kevin, we are just going through the final process of finalizing that policy reviewing with the board and we look forward to sharing it sometime in the mid-May timeframe, we think, and then we will give you a much more exact idea at that point in time. I think, for now, I would just remind you of what we said in our prepared comments. We recognize that we have got the opportunity to put more debt on the balance sheet. We intend to do so and we intend to use some of the cash that\u2019s on our balance sheet.","So we will certainly have a more efficient balance sheet going forward. I think if you simply look at what the typical credit agency, the rating agencies' metrics are for BBB companies, you would typically see anywhere from two to three times the debt to EBITDA leverages as being typical for AAA or for BBB companies. I think in our industry, they would be a little bit more conservative than that. So we will use those as guidelines as we finalize this policy. But please be a little bit patient, give us a little more time and look for us to provide you more detain in the mid-May timeframe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Yes, good morning. I wanted to follow-up with Mike Rahm just on your potash comments. Mike, you indicated that you were seeing strong volume recovery globally this year but it seems in some of spot markets like Brazil, South East Asian and more importantly the U.S., we are not seeing any price movement. So why is it that this volume recovery isn\u2019t treating you too more price momentum in the domestic market in particular? Just as part B of my question, with prospective plantings is coming in a few hours, Mike, what's your view, the USDA has this very big recovery in production and in stocks this year but will they return to trend line yield, just wondered what your view of that forecast is?","Mike Rahm","Hi, good morning, Don. I guess I would take exception to the view that product prices haven\u2019t moved. If you look at what's happened in Brazil, right after the settlement of the China contract in the 400 range and the Indian contract in the 427 range, prices traded down and Brazil, the most active spot market into that 410 to 420 range. Today, our product is moving into that market at 440 and offers for the April, May June period, the gut slide of their big import period are up in the 450 to 460 range. So we have always said the larger than expected baseload contracts to China and India probably set the stage for fundamentals to play out and then as they play out and we see this rebound in demand this year, we are seeing some decent price appreciation.","In North America we think these recent developments have set a floor under North American prices which had traded at a premium to some of the international values. So I think when you look at the projected stocks of North American producers, while they remain elevated today with the exports of sales on the books by Canpotex, plus the outlook for a very strong fourth fiscal quarter for Mosaic. We see those inventories getting pulled down to normal levels. So I think that will help support the price momentum that we see right now.","In terms of the U.S. acreage report, we are all excited about the release here in a few hours. In terms of acreage, we are in that 97 million to 97.5 million acre range. I think the consensus is right in that range as well. As far as the expected yield, I think the short answer to that is, no one knows what that is going to be. We went back and looked at what's happened to yields following the last three major droughts, in 1983, 1988 and again in 1993. And in each of the years following those droughts, we saw a very strong rebound back to trend. And so, I think, yield is going to depend largely on rainfall and growing degree days this summer and I think that's the bottom line and I'd like some of the analyst views that everyone's growing a very large crop in their spread sheets and we are not going to know what's going to happen until we see how weather plays out, so its' far too early I think to make a call.","I think one of the things that's happened is that with the improvement in moisture conditions, there's less concern of drought, but that has raised all of set of issues looking at late spring as everyone is aware. I think last week rather than ice melting what happened ice was forming and now the first barge is expected to arrive in same fall somewhere the week of April 20th. So, we sort of transitioned here from a concern about drought to late planting, the potential for serious flooding in many parts of North America. And bottom line is to a great extent our fate is in the hands of mother nature and we simply don't know how that's going to play out yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotia Bank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Bank","Jim, maybe you can just provide some color as to how the JV with Ma'aden evolved and how that was formed. And then I was also a little unclear did they as ask you for technical expertise on the first phase and you said no, or they did not ask you? And then finally, what is the timing on the Bay\u00f3var Phase 2 decision? Thank you.","James Prokopanko","Hello, Ben. I'll take your first two questions and I am going to ask Joc to answer the Bay\u00f3var Miski Mayo second question. Important and you raised it to understand that this is a joint venture investment. This isn't purely an equity investment. We are making an equity investment, but we do have claim to 25% of the product that will come through the joint venture, and we will sell that product to customers as we choose to. That will be similar for the partners SABIC as well as the Ma'aden fertilizer. They will sell their share of the fertilizer. The revenues go to the joint venture and we're sharing that profit, and that's how it's going to work. This has nothing to do with Phase 1. This is strictly the Phase 2 project, which is going to be in approximate 3.5 million tons of finished phosphate fertilizer. And Phase 1 will just be kept right out of it.","You asked the question how did we get involved in this, we've known the Ma'aden people for some while. Phase 1 just didn't happen. The two organizations didn't get together on that. It was well down the road when those opportunities were there. And as far as technical expertise, we have an understanding between two parties more details yet to be ironed out, but we will be making contributions through know-how and personnel in the design and operation of the Phase 2 facility.","Now I am going to move this over to Joc to talk about the timing on Miski Mayo.","James O'Rourke","In terms of the Bay\u00f3var 2 or the Miski Mayo expansion, I think it's almost too early to talk about. I recognize we have two joint venture partners in that project. We are just getting ramped up to the design rate for Phase 1. We have a lot of what I would call betting in or stabilizing of phase, making sure that that's running well at which point three joint-venture partners and we are the engineering and design, but at that point three joint-venture partners will seriously at the economics and the future of Bay\u00f3var too, including market question. So, that's probably ways off yet before we make that decision.","James Prokopanko","Ben, I just want to add another item too, which is the Ma'aden Phase 2 project, and you will be hearing more details as we get further into the finalizing of many of the details that are involved but there will be a board of the Ma'aden Phase 2 we are going to have. I guess we will have two members on the board, SABIC will have one, Ma'aden will have four or five. So we are going to be quite involved in the management operations and direction of that investment. Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank.","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Jim, I know you are still doing your cost work on the last 2 million ton of the potash expansion, but can you give us a rough estimate of how much more expensive that could be than the first 3 million ton? If the last 2 million tons is delayed, does CapEx approach $1 billion in 2015? Thank you.","James Prokopanko","David you asked the question, if I have this right, what is the difference in per unit cost for Phase 2, is that correct?","David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank","Correct. Yes.","James Prokopanko","Yes, that are the next deferred base. These are the higher cost based projects. The ones we commenced with and started with were the lower per unit CapEx cost, the easier projects, if you will, and the quicker projects. As we go further down, these projects become more complex, become more expensive and I think the only guidance we have given is blended all-in the 5 million tons that we have talked about is going to be in the $5 billion range.","So, you are averaging $1,000 $1,200 to a ton. These latter projects are going to be more than the $1,000 a ton average there, so to speak. Some of these were $500 to $600 ton projects, there were some $1,500 ton projects. So it's difficult to say. We are not prepared to say what these latter projects are but suffice to say even these latter projects and certainly the earlier projects these are far, far better than anything you would expect with a greenfield and probably in the range of, at worst case, half the cost of a greenfield project.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line\u2026","James Prokopanko","Excuse me, I am sorry. David, you had a second part, if it's delayed what would CapEx for 2015 be and I am going to ask Larry to speak to that.","Lawrence Stranghoener","I would suggest that we are trying to give some more guidance on financial policy in mid-May. At that time we will also give some more highlights with respect to long-term CapEx plans. But just keep a couple of things in mind.","One is that sustaining capital requirements are probably in the $700 million to $800 million annual range. We will likely face the opportunity to build two new phosphate rock mines beginning later in the decade to the tune of $1 billion dollar each spread out over a number of years. As many of you know, we are still in the final decision-making stages on a new ammonia plant. So, there are a number of items in our CapEx plans that we will be giving more clarity on sometime before the end of this fiscal year. So, my point is, just because we maybe delaying if we choose to do so, our potash expansions, I don't want people to think that our capital expenditures are likely to be declining dramatically. We will give you more color on that soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley with BGC Financial.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Good morning. Larry, let me try another balance sheet question recognizing that we will get more detail in a couple of months. If I look at the math that you went through with respect to uses of cash, short-term. If I start off with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, the buffers that you talked about added up to roughly $2 billion. So therefore, what that suggests that cash available for share repurchases is going to be in that $1.3 billion area. Thanks, Larry.","Lawrence Stranghoener","I think, Mark, that we are not looking at only cash available for share repurchases. We have got this great opportunity to rebalance the balance sheet with increased debt. So we will be looking for a combination of debts and available cash for share repurchases. Much of our decision will depend upon circumstances at the time and what is the price of the stock, what is the cost to borrow, what is the aptitude of the other parties to this transaction to participate. So I can't give you any more detail or anymore precision at this point in time. I would simply emphasize the point that we've made many times. And I'll repeat, we have very deliberately built a strong balance sheet to allow us to take advantage of the opportunities we are going to have this summer and whether we are looking at cash on hand, available cash or debt capacity, we've got ample opportunity to return capital to shareholders as well as to continue to invest in our business for growth and for returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","Yes. Hi. I was wondering if you guys could give an update sort of on the Faustina ammonia potential expansion project and kind of your thoughts in terms of what some of your competitors do and whether that might influence your decision at all and some of the other factors you're considering. Thanks.","James Prokopanko","Hello, Michael. The ammonia expansion you've heard us talk about, I think we are one of the earliest out of the gates on that and it has become a crowded field since then. The point that we are at is that we are continuing our feed or frontend engineering design work. We are going to have that wrapped up over the next, I think, 90 days to be complete. This is a large project. The price range would be for 1 million tons of additional ammonia production, which is a combination of greenfield ammonia plant and debottlenecking expansion of our current approximate 0.5 million tons of production.","It's going to range, we think, between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. That's a lot of money. So once we have the final numbers, and that's just our practice, for major expansions like this, we like to have a high confidence in what the final cost is going to be before we make the final call. There has been more to be seen on that. There has been a big gold rush mentality on nitrogen.","U.S. imports about 7 million tons to 8 million tons of ammonia a year given the price spread between marginal costs of production, which is Russian gas into Ukrainian plants. That's about equivalent to $8, $9 MMBTU gas prices, so U.S. has a considerable advantage, so 7 million tons or 8 million tons are imported into the U.S., I expect that farmers working we are going to see 7 million to 8 million tons of new capacity come into the U.S.","These are long lead time projects. If we made a decision today, we expect it is going to be upwards of four years before we get the first ton of the project out considering all permitting and construction costs, so giving you a long story here to say that it's a long lead time, a lot of things can change, so looking at the final cost over the next few months get a better sense of who is really serious about making these serious $1 dollar-plus investments and we will make the call later in the summer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn with Barclays.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","Hey, good morning. We've talked a little bit about the positive outlook you are seeing for global potash shipments in relative to your earlier projections for 50 million ton level. How are indications looking for phosphate shipments globally? I believe you had forecast somewhere around 63 million, 65 million tons before largely predicated on demand in the Americas?","Mike Rahm","Hi. Good morning, Matthew. This is Mike Rahm. Yes. In terms of our global phosphate shipment forecast, we have not changed that we are still in that 63 to 65 range through the first quarter of the year, basis our current point estimate we are kind of right in the middle that range.","I think with the exception of India, it's pretty much the same story. Starting in the Americas, North American phosphate shipments have just been phenomenal, frankly. If you look at the numbers from last fall, they are well above the seven-year average, well above the maximum of the seven-year high\/low range. We had good follow through during our third fiscal quarter, and we think the fourth fiscal quarter will be about average, so extraordinarily good shipments in North America.","Same story in Brazil. As you know that last year total fertilizer shipments there were 29.5 million tons. We think that will increase to 31 million tons. We expect that Brazil will import more than 4 million tons of phosphate products. A record, seeing good demand in most of the other Asian markets. So, we are on track to hit that 63 million, 65 million range, I believe.","But one thing I would like to mention that it kind of relates to Don's earlier question, is that even with a good rebound in global yields this year, an important point is to note that I think there is some pent-up demand. If you looked at the chart in our presentation that showed global grain and oilseed stocks you saw the big drawdown that is occurring in 2012, 2013. That drawdown assumes a very modest increase in grain and oilseed use.","In fact, if you look at the projected growth in grain and oilseed use in 2012, 2013, it's 0.6%. That followed the previous four years when grain and oil seed demand grew at 2.2%, 2.3%, 2.3%, 2.6% per year. So, I think even if we get a very, very good supply response, what we are going to see is that, some point of grain prices begin to come down or moderate a bit, there's a potential for an unleashing of this pent-up demand and the fact that crop nutrients remain highly affordable simply underpins our forecast for record P&K shipments this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Hi, good morning. I have a question for Mike. In your potash shipment expectation of 55 million to 57 million tons for the industry, what's your China number?","Mike Rahm","China number is, imports of about. Sorry, Jeff, didn\u2019t have the microphone on. Our forecast for China, I believe are, imports of about 6.5 million tons and their domestic production will probably be in the range of 4 million tons. So call it 10 to 11 and as I noted before if you look at what they have contracted for the first half of the year, it's just probably in the 4 million to 4.5 million ton range. So that's a number we are watching very carefully that we think that there could be some upside in that forecast if things play out the way we think they could.","With that, I am going to conclude our call and reiterate a few of the key messages we want to leave you with. First, agricultural fundamentals remained very strong here in North America and elsewhere around the world. Second, we are seeing strong global demand for our products. Third, we have substantial cash and borrowing capacity and we look forward to deploying it in the year ahead and you are going to hear much more about that later this fiscal year sometime in May. Finally, we have got great confidence in Mosaic's future. Our critical mission of helping the world grow the food it need bears very substantial promise for our customers, our employees, our communities and of course for our shareholders.","Thanks very much. Have a great weekend.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14786":["The Mosaic Co.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions. Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon. Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our first quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Mosaic's momentum continue to build in the third quarter. Our results reflect improved market conditions as well as the benefits of the many moves we've made to strengthen the company. Our key points today are, first, Mosaic has made tremendous progress. We've transformed our businesses and created significant operational leverage. Second, global potash and phosphate market fundamentals are improving. Demand growth remained strong while supply is materializing slowly. And, third, as a result of our increased operational leverage and improving market conditions, we are optimistic about our future, both near and longer term. We have a road map to generate significant cash and drive strong shareholder returns.","For the quarter, Mosaic's net earnings were $247 million compared with $227 million a year ago. Year-to-date, net earnings were $358 million. We delivered earnings per share of $0.64 or $0.75 net of notable items, a year-over-year increase of 78% despite our higher share count. Just one year ago, we announced significant financial and operational moves to position the company for success. We idled our Plant City phosphate operations and indicated we would focus on increasing the efficiency and recovery rate at our remaining phosphate plants.","We announced significant increases in our expected transformational targets related to Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced our intention to delever the balance sheet by 2020. Since we announced these actions, we have accelerated our progress and created significant earnings leverage as today's results clearly indicate. We reported year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion. We increased our 2018 synergy expectation from Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced we've reached our through-cycle debt-to-EBITDA targets.","Overall, good market conditions and robust performance across our three business units are leading to better 2018 results than our initial expectations. Today, we increased our guidance for 2018 annual adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.80 to $2 per share.","Let's start with Mosaic Fertilizantes, our business in South America. Year-to-date, in 2018, Mosaic Fertilizantes has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $277 million compared with the pro forma EBITDA of $50 million a year ago. The performance of that business has been helped by excellent Brazilian agricultural market conditions and a weaker Brazilian real. But the key driver of the improved earnings has been our transformation of the business. We are achieving synergies faster than expected and we now expect to reach $140 million to $160 million in net savings in 2018. We also expect to reach our target of $275 million in net savings well before the end of 2020.","The transformation of the business and the benefits of our upstream\/downstream integration are easily visible, both on the ground in Brazil and in our results. Across our plants and mines, employees are energized and they are bringing innovative ideas to improve our operating efficiency. When we announced the transaction, we expected it to be accretive to earnings. Year-to-date, the acquired business has added $0.11 per share, inclusive of the impact of issuing $1 billion in debt and 34 million shares, but exclusive of the $8 million reserve in the third quarter for the potential of paying out on the contingent portion of the purchase price.","Moving onto the phosphate market, which remains relatively tight, prices held steady following a $75 increase over the past year. Margins are under a bit of pressure with raw material prices rising. Still fundamentals are very strong. In fact, our outlook for Phosphates has continued to improve over the past several quarters.","Global demand continues to grow and our market analysis team expects another record year for shipments in 2019. Several actions have tightened supply, including the idling of our Plant City facility, slower-than-expected ramp-ups of new facilities, and reduced Chinese export. In 2019, we expect global demand growth to outpace supply additions, requiring higher global operating rates and providing support to prices and margins.","The market is feeling a temporary impact from the wet fall in North America. The expectation of an early harvest and in turn an early fall fertilizer application season has not come to fruition. Shifts in agricultural seasons can delay or accelerate demand, but they rarely affect the full-year sales. It is important to remember that this business is seasonal, as well as cyclical.","This expected seasonality is reflected in our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. The changes we've made in our phosphate business magnify the impact of these improving market conditions. Transformation is well under way in our Phosphates business unit, which has produced $653 million of year-to-date adjusted EBITDA, up almost twofold compared to the same period a year ago.","We have made extensive structural permanent changes to the way we operate, resulting in a much more efficient business for the long term. We said we would run our remaining plant harder and we have, with operating rates up 7% year-over-year.","Let's move on to Potash. The potash market is tighter today than it has been in years and prices are moving up as a result. In addition, the discount we saw recently in the U.S. has largely disappeared. Supply disruptions experienced by some of our competitors and the slow ramp-up of new supply, combined with growing global demand, have driven potash prices higher by approximately $60 per tonne over the prior year. The Potash business unit began its transformation before the other segments, as its consistently low cost base demonstrates.","The teams at our three world-class potash mines are executing at a very high level, with strong day to day production and like our other business units, excellent safety and environmental performance. At the same time, the ramp-up of Esterhazy K3 continues according to our expectations. As the transition progresses, we will have the ability to drive production costs still lower with an efficient new mine and phasing out of brine management expenses at K1 and K2. In fact, we completed the conveyor belt tie in from the K3 shaft to the K2 mill this summer.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Clint Freeland to discuss current period results and near-term guidance. Clint?","Clint C. Freeland - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. During the third quarter, Mosaic generated $0.64 in fully diluted earnings per share, $0.75 per share after adjusting for notable items; and adjusted EBITDA of $606 million. As noted earlier, these strong results were driven by the combination of continued progress on our cost structure and business transformation initiatives across the company and improved market conditions. With these strong quarterly earnings came strong cash flow from operations at $524 million.","As you can see, Mosaic ended the third quarter with just over $1 billion in unrestricted cash, roughly in line with the balance at the end of the second quarter despite paying down $400 million in debt during the quarter, investing $241 million in CapEx, and experiencing a $200 million reversal in customer prepayments in Brazil.","Based on the strong financial performance to-date and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance for the third time this year. We now expect the company to generate adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share $1.80 to $2.","In addition to strong year-to-date results, our guidance reflects continued strength into the fourth quarter, albeit with normal seasonality; the accelerated realization of synergies in Brazil, as outlined earlier; and a foreign exchange rate of roughly BRL 3.7 to the U.S. dollar.","The primary risk in our fourth quarter outlook is currency-related given the recent volatility of certain currencies, particularly the Brazilian real. That said, as always, we continue to monitor grain and oilseed prices and international trade developments and any impact that they may have on finished fertilizer markets.","Mosaic's substantial cash generation over the course of this year has allowed us to pay down $700 million of debt, meeting our deleveraging commitment two years ahead of schedule. While our debt metrics are now more in line with previously-disclosed through-cycle target levels, we are cognizant of the cyclical nature of our industry and the necessity for financial strength and stability through all parts of the cycle.","It's important to note the sensitivity of our leverage ratio to prices. For example, a $20 per tonne change in product pricing can move adjusted EBITDA by $340 million and net debt to EBITDA by 0.4 turns. As such, we intend to continue evaluating whether further debt reduction over time as part of a balanced capital allocation program is appropriate.","With that said, our capital philosophy has not changed. Our top priority continues to be ensuring a solid long term foundation for the company. We will continue to invest in our core assets to ensure they're safe, reliable, and efficient operation and maintain financial strength and flexibility through prudent balance sheet management. Beyond that, we allocate capital to the highest risk-adjusted return opportunities available to the company while also keeping in mind that a regular return of capital to shareholders is a key element to a balanced and efficient capital allocation program.","With that, I'll turn it back to you, Joc, for closing comments.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Clint. We expect to have many opportunities to grow in the years ahead. Of course, there are many factors we keep an eye on. At the moment, we're monitoring the impacts of the recent election in Brazil and the strengthening Brazilian real, as well as Chinese phosphate export volumes. But the cyclical trend for industry is clearly up and Mosaic has earned a very strong position from which to outperform. We have created a highly efficient, low-cost franchise and we are confident that we have the talent and that we will continue to generate the capital necessary to win and grow for the long term.","Now, I will take your questions, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. The Ma'aden JV that you have is not really showing up in equity earnings right now. It seems like it was just a small loss. Could you talk a little bit about what your expectation is for operating that facility in terms of when it would hit full production rates and when it would contribute to Mosaic's equity earnings?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thank you, Ian. Welcome. If I'm looking at Ma'aden and our involvement in Ma'aden, I would say, look, our expectations for Ma'aden was that over the long-term, this would be involvement in one of the largest lowest cost phosphate developments in the world. As such, it was not meant to be an early quick return. And, as you know, it's a very large complicated project, and with those, we expect, at least, it will take time for that to ramp up. And so, our expectations \u2013 and I think you really need to go to Ma'aden to see the official expectations of their ramp-up, but as we come to full production, that will be a very low-cost producer and we should start to see earnings from it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for having me on the call. So on the K3 mine, can you just maybe provide a little bit more updates there when you expect it to be fully up and running, what that does for your brine costs, and maybe just help clarify the conveyor system from K3 to K1, K2, what's that capacity, I mean, within this near term and then over the longer term? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Good morning, Andrew. So, the K3, in terms of timing, we are on the same schedule we've been on for some time now, which was to integrate K3 \u2013 startup K3 and slowly ramp it up to completely take over from K1 and K2 in that 2023 to 2025 timeframe. What is happening today is, as we mentioned earlier, we have just connected the conveyor from K3 to K2 that will allow the startup of commercial production and ramping up of the incremental 1 million tonnes that would go into the K2 and K1 mills.","Each of those conveyors will be capable of approximately, let's say, 3 million tonnes of finished product or approximately 9 million tonnes of ore. So, what that allows us to do is, over time, completely reproduce the production from K1 and K2 from K3. Once that is complete, we will decommission K1 and K2, which will eliminate all brine costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson of BMO Capital Markets.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. This is Robin on for Joel. Thanks for taking my question. Can you walk us through the cadence of the guidance reduction for the Phosphates margins in terms of both phosphate and feedstock prices? And how do you expect margins to fare in Q1 2019 and, if you can, into the rest of the year? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sorry, Robin. Could you repeat the start of that question? It was a little unclear on the call.","Robin Fiedler - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Yeah. Sorry. So if you can just walk us through more the cadence of the about $10 per tonne gross margin decline in the Phosphates business in terms of both phosphate pricing and feedstock prices in Q4 and just how you expect that margin to fare in Q1?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Okay. Great. What I'll do here, Robin, is I will hand this to Corrine. But as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, there is some margin pressure on \u2013 which is normal seasonality at the end of the year and mostly due \u2013 more than price due to raw material tightness. One thing I will say though on this is although the margins do tighten, we end up having a small competitive advantage at these prices of ammonia and beyond because most of our ammonia is based on production costing, so that actually helps us against the competitive market. In terms of the Q1 outlook, let me ask Corrine or Mike to give a few comments.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Joc. We are seeing a little bit of a seasonal price pressure on the margin. This is pretty normal factor. We have had a late start to the fall season and although it's been late, now that things have got moving, we're seeing very big volume movements. And so, some of the nervousness in the market that happens at this time seasonally is starting to abate because of the strong movement in the shipments.","Some of that margin pressure is a little bit of price compression only in the North American market, which was at a significant premium to the other global markets, as well as a little bit of raw material price increase. The other thing I would say about these seasonal dips that we see for the winter fill time period is that we virtually always see that recover as we get into those spring seasons. So, it's a very temporary seasonal setback.","Mike, do you have anything you want to add?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","No. The only thing I would add is if you look at the seasonal pattern, I mean margins in Q4 have dropped in five of the last five years and they've rebounded in four of the last five years by more than the seasonal drop in the fourth quarter. So, yeah, I would term this just a normal seasonal adjustment in margins.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Mike, do you want to just give a little color on the market going forward in through Q1 and beyond in terms of the tightness of the phosphate market?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. If you look at our supply and demand for 2019, we see decent growth. I'll start on the demand side. We're looking at about 1.8% or 1.2 million metric tonnes of additional demand in 2019. And that should start, I think, in a normal seasonal way as far as positioning for the Southern Hemisphere crop and the Northern Hemisphere crop.","And what's interesting, if you look on the supply side, we see several puts and takes there. We expect that on the negative side, we're seeing a couple of shutdowns in the U.S. or in North America with the Redwater plant and the Geismar plant.","We are seeing some incremental capacity come on in terms of a continued ramp-up of the Ma'aden joint venture, the Jorf Phosphate Hub number IV, as well as some smaller plants coming on stream in Turkey and Egypt.","So, we've put all that together and when you add up the changes in demand versus the changes in supply, we still come up with roughly a balance not taking into account any changes in China. And our assessment is that we could see a 0.5 million tonne to 1 million tonne or more decline in Chinese exports.","So, what we see is another period much like this year where the phosphate market remains in deficit. And what we're saying there is that the world doesn't run out of phosphate, but you see pipelines get drawn down. You maybe see a little bit of demand curved on the edges in some markets and you do see existing producers probably squeezing out a few more tonnes to reach an equilibrium in the market.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson.","Jake Lacks - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. This is Jake Lacks on for Don. On capital deployment, can I say your debt pay down target should be a reflection of cash flow next year (00:22:17) prices are today. Can you kind of give a little more color on your priorities there?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Jake. Well, I'm going to talk a little bit and maybe hand this over to Clint to talk some more and give us some more color. But to summarize, with the impact of our business improvements, obviously, the impact of our Brazil acquisition and improved market conditions, this year, we've been able to generate approximately $1.2 billion of operating cash flow, which really highlights just the kind of earnings power we've created in this business.","This, as you mentioned, has allowed us to pay down the $700 million of term loans well ahead of our target, as a matter of fact, over two years ahead of our schedule. So, this has put us in a position to really review our overall capital allocation philosophy and targets. So let me hand it over to Clint just to give a little more color on how we've been thinking about our capital philosophy going forward.","Clint C. Freeland - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Joc. Hi, Jake. So, I think when it comes to allocating capital, as we've talked about before, our first priority is ensuring that the company has a really solid financial and operational foundation, making sure that the company's leverage profile and liquidity position is where it should be to remain strong and flexible through the cycle. I think it's also important to invest appropriately to maintain the safe and efficient operation of our core assets.","Now, beyond that, I would look to and I think we would look to allocate capital to the highest risk-adjusted return opportunities available to us. We also pay a common dividend on our stock. And while it's fairly modest at this point, we do think it's an important part of a balanced allocation program and we'll continue to evaluate what that payout looks like over time.","I think, going forward, when we expect earnings and cash flow to be strong, I would expect to see a balanced capital allocation program where we continue to strengthen the balance sheet, invest to grow the business and provide a regular return of capital to our shareholders. So I think that's how we tend to think about capital allocation and try to prioritize our program.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks Clint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Two questions. Why do you think Chinese phosphate exports will decrease another 0.5 million tonnes next year, that is what's behind it? And in terms of your cash flows, your receivables jumped up a couple of hundred million dollars sequentially, so did your payables. What's behind that? And how did the $200 million reversal of Brazilian prepayments flow through? Was that a benefit or not a benefit? What line did that touch?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sorry, Jeff. Got the mic.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","First of all, let's talk about Chinese exports and what we think of Chinese exports, and I'm going to leave this to Corrine to really talk about. But at a high level, we do see active things by the Chinese government to reduce both water and air pollution and particularly to reduce pollution along the Yangtze River. And those are now starting to take effect and they're increasing the cost to produce phosphates in China but also reducing the overall availability of Chinese phosphate.","So, with that, let me hand that one to Corrine, and I will come back to the cash flow question.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. We are seeing a decrease in Chinese export. While we've seen a small increase year-to-date, January through September, in those DAP exports, the MAP exports are off very significantly, about 23%. And that really is a result of what Joc was talking about with the environmental pressures happening on producers. There are a number of things happening in the environmental area, and that's what we've been talking about for a while on Chinese exports.","The first is that there are taxes that have been levied against the producers that are adding $10 to $15 a tonne in their operating costs because they have to pay tax against the environmental pollution. The second thing that's happening is higher operating costs, so there is a significant reduction in rock mining because the government has disallowed mining in some environmentally sensitive areas. And so, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reports that phosphate rock mining is down 30% through September. So, you have producers that used to be integrated with the rock mines are now nonintegrated producers having to purchase rock from others and rock prices are up significantly. We're also starting to see the start of rock imports into China, indicating a shortage of that raw material.","And then lastly, I would say, there are significant capital costs at risk here as well. You've got plants that are within the 1 mile region on the Yangtze River are being forced to relocate and some that are a little farther out from 1 mile are being told that they have significant capital they have to spend to manage their gypsum differently and handle other environmental pollutions differently. So, we believe \u2013 and the timing on those changes and those plant relocations is by the end of 2019 and then some by the end of 2020 for the capital investment. So, we really believe that there will be a watershed year here in 2019, 2020 on the environmental impacts affecting these Chinese producers and we expect exports will be down. Again, we're carefully watching these exports, and if you take a rolling 12-month look at exports, they are down about 11%.","Mike, anything you want to add?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Well, yeah, I'd highlight that the rolling 12 months total on September 30th was down I think 1.17 million tonnes from September 30, 2017. So, there has been a substantial decrease. If there are other questions later on, maybe we can come back and talk about a specific example.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good. Jeff, well, I'm going to leave that one there. Obviously, the bottom line is what we're seeing is we're seeing stuff on the ground, and these higher prices are driving probably some higher utilization and plants may not necessarily have otherwise been running at this time. Now, we're going to move on to the question \u2013 I'm just going to rephrase this a little bit to make sure I've got it right. But if I heard you correctly, cash flow from receivables is actually up by two months this year and you were asking us to clarify what is the impact of the Brazil prepayments on our cash position. I'm going to hand that straight over to Clint who, I think, has a pretty good understanding of what you're trying to get.","Clint C. Freeland - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Joc. So, I'll start with the Brazilian prepayments. Those prepayments, at the end of the second quarter, were about $500 million in cash, and where you see that on the balance sheet is in the cash balance and in our payables. And when that reverses, what you have is it almost gets transferred from the balance sheet, goes to the income statement where that $200 million reduction in prepayments comes out of the cash balance and then flows through your P&L. And then, to the extent that you have no margin on those sales, which obviously you do, that would then come back for the cash flow statement onto your balance sheet. And so, net-net, you'll have a reduction in overall cash balance for those prepayments, but not the full $200 million because you'll end up with the margin on your balance sheet.","I think the other part of your question was around receivable and payable balances, and one of the things that I would \u2013 I assume that you're looking at our balance sheet. Recall that we closed on our acquisition on, I believe, January 8th. And so, the effect of the acquisition and bringing the working capital balances onto the balance sheet is part of that delta. As you look at the quarter, in particular, I would say that from a receivables standpoint, we had pretty high sales in September in North America, in particular. And so, that would have been booked into receivables that should again turn in the fourth quarter. So, that would be the story around receivables. I think payables, nothing really out of the ordinary there. I think it's just a matter of timing of various accruals and other things throughout the year. So, I would say, nothing of particular note there.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thank you, Clint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson.","Oliver S. Rowe - Scotiabank","Oh, yes. It's Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. So, looking at your phosphate shipment outlook on slide 18, you have a meaningful increase in shipments to India in 2019. Do you not expect any demand destruction from India's rupee depreciating, rising phosphoric acid prices and the higher MRPs which are all impacting affordability? Maybe to put that another way, if the currency were to revert and\/or the MRPs dropped, would there be further upside to your demand estimate for India?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Oliver. I'm going to mostly hand this to Corrine, but let me make just a general statement. And India probably is the most sensitive to this. But in any situation, and next year, I believe, is a situation where we're going to be somewhat supply-constrained in terms of growth. I think, then, at some point, you do have to ration ultimate supply. And so the least affordable markets will have to ration their growth. And I think that is something that could happen depending on price movements in India, but it will only be because of those price movements. So there's obviously some sensitivity to both currency and prices in a market where their product is not sold on the international market but sold at a controlled price in country.","Corrine, do you want to talk about that a little bit, please?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. I think there's a couple things that we're watching very closely here. And we have been looking to see if there's any evidence of demand destruction, and we aren't seeing it yet today. It is sensitive to currency changes. All of those seem to have stabilized. And they have adjusted their MRPs several times throughout the year. And at each level, we're continuing to see farmer purchasing. And so, as of today, it looks like we are continuing to not \u2013 we're not seeing demand destruction. We're continuing to see strong demand for phosphates.","We also have an increase in the 2019 shipments because you've seen a relatively significant reduction in the domestic production and operating rates with the domestic producers, and that needs to be made up with some import volume.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Corrine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Falcao.","Alexandre Falcao - HSBC Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. My question is regarding Brazil. What made you increase the targets and synergy there? And you said that you're monitoring the new government. There is a massive shift in the currency from BRL 4.50 to BRL 3.70 now. I just want to understand the impacts of that going forward for you and I know you guys have a very complex hedging policy and what you're exposed, were you long of the currency there or short of the currency there? I just wanted to understand what that effect is going to have going forward? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Alex, thank you. So, let me hit this in order. If I've got it, there's sort of three aspects here I just want to hit. First of all, let's talk about the election of Mr. Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro ran on a pro-business, pro-agricultural campaign. In fact, Bolsonaro was officially endorsed by the Agricultural Parliamentary Group during the elections. So, that is a positive from an agricultural perspective. However, in Brazil, to make things happen, you really have to build coalitions so it's a little early to see. The one thing I will say, however, though, is his first appointees, including his nominee for justice minister, Sergio Moro, and his nominee for finance minister, Paulo Guedes, have both been very well received, and I believe those bode well for his success which we look forward to.","The second question you asked was about the synergies, and what I would say there is what we had was a Brazil team that really took this on and has done a very good job of going after synergies and improvement, which has put us in a position to achieve more than the $100 million that we originally thought we'd achieve this year, matter of fact, our $140 million to $160 million, but also puts us ahead of schedule to achieve our total $275 million of synergies we ultimately expect to achieve from that business.","In terms of the currency and the hedging, I really think there's enough detail there that I should hand that over to Clint to talk a little bit about our strategy.","Clint C. Freeland - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Hi. Thanks, Joc. So, I think from a currency hedging standpoint, we typically hedge on a rolling three-month basis to the extent that we are along the BRL. And so, when you have at least short-term volatility in the BRL, we should generally be hedged against that. Longer term, we do also hedge against some of our BRL expenses. If you recall, a lot of our revenues there are dollar-based and our expenses are BRL-based. And so, what we try to do is to have again kind of a rolling program over time that at least allows us to navigate some of the shorter term volatility, but I think longer term you are a little more subject to the currency fluctuations that you see again over time.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Clint.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson.","Graeme Welds - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","This is Graeme Welds on for Chris. I was just wondering about the volume guidance on both kind of the Phosphates and the Potash side, where on the Phosphates side, it looks like you took it down a little bit and I think at the beginning of the call you spoke about some seasonal factors particularly in North America maybe influencing that. I was wondering if you could give any color on the composition of what that volume outlook looks like in terms of that map versus MicroEssentials, etcetera. And then on the Potash side, a similar question where your volumes appear to be quite strong. I'm just curious where you're seeing kind of most of that strength heading into 4Q. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thank you, Graeme. I'm going to hand this over to Corrine, but let me start with the volume guidance for Potash. Clearly, with the strength and the tightness of the potash market globally, we're seeing good international demand right now which is more than offset the slight seasonal weakness you might have expected at the end of the normal North American season. In terms of Phosphates guidance, the volume drop there is normal seasonality that's probably driven mostly by the completion of the biggest season in Brazil and the end of the North American fall application season.","Corrine, do you want to make a few comments?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Not a lot to add there, Joc. I completely agree on the Potash side. We have big shipments going on and good volume expected in the fourth quarter. The only limitation really is going to be just getting all of those logistics to get that volume moved and the Phosphates guidance issue is largely that winter fill season, do we end the fall season and the peak fall season with a strong winter fill program that moves into December or does it really move into that January time period? And we're forecasting a normal amount of winter fill activity for December rather than, well, last year was an exceptionally large winter fill early in December.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Corrine.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. I'm trying to make sense of your Q4 guidance. So, yeah, your Phosphates guidance is down, but your Potash guidance is up, and then your Vale Fertilizantes is down. If I tally them all up, I end up with about a $0.10 reduction, which is usually \u2013 well, what you usually get in Q4. And yet your implied guidance for EPS in Q4 is minus $0.20 or so. Am I missing something or are you being conservative, or how should we think about that?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sorry, Jonas. We're looking at each other to try and understand if we can \u2013 as you know, we don't actually give EPS guidance on a division by division thing. I'm not sure I know how to answer that. I'm going to hand it to Clint to see what he can.","Clint C. Freeland - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Jonas, I would maybe suggest that we take it offline and provide you some clarity. I think we're having a little somewhat of a challenge kind of understanding and answering your question right now, but I think we can follow up with you if that's okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A lot of ground's covered. Just on the Potash side, your guidance for next year on shipments, can you talk about your supply outlook? What's the assumption of incremental capacity coming from K+S, from EuroChem closures and the rest of the world? And is there any assumption or early kind of view that Canadian production ex-K+S would be up in any material amount in 2019? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Adam. Sure. We'll give you \u2013 I'll get Mike to give you an overall look at the S&D. The one thing you just asked that I would like to highlight, I think our view is over the next five years, one of the things that will happen is the output of the North American suppliers ex-K+S will actually increase as the other supply is used up and the market gets tighter. Really, the only excess capacity out there today sits with the big two North American suppliers. And so, with that, I expect the utilization rate by those two might well increase in the next few years.","Mike, do you want to just give a quick highlight of the S&D?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. We actually published this in the non-deal roadshow report that is on the website. There's detail in terms of our changes in the S&D. And in terms of \u2013 let me just talk a little bit about 2018 first and how that carries over. But when we look at \u2013 there's been a series of either call it supply disruptions or supply changes that have probably taken a good 0.5 million tonnes out of the market. So, as you know, the ICL closed their Boulby mine midyear. SQM is maximizing the amount of lithium they produce versus potassium chloride. K+S had production problems at its Werra Complex with low water levels in adjoining rivers, and so forth. So, you add that up, there's about 500,000 tonnes of lost production. Next year when we look at this, K+S is going to close their Sigmundshall mine, which is probably 450,000 tonnes. The Boulby mine produced half of this year, so there'll be another half of year loss there.","So, when we add up 1.2 million or 1.1 million tonnes of demand growth, coupled with the supply changes that we see, we show a deficit of about 0.5 million tonnes. And, again, as we said, for phosphate, we're not expecting the world to run out of potash anytime soon, but we do think that implies that pipeline inventories worldwide get drawn down to very low levels and that prices remain elevated enough to bring supply and demand into equilibrium.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews.","Neil Chandan Sanyal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Neil calling in for Vincent. A couple of questions on Mosaic Fertilizantes. You accelerated the 2018 synergy capture, but it seems that the gross margin per tonne for the segment is being guided down a bit sequentially to $40 per metric tonne at the midpoint versus $42 at 3Q. So, what is driving that? And then, second, total synergies were kept flat at $275 million. Is there still an opportunity for additional upside for that number?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Neil, thanks. Well, first of all, let me talk about the Fertilizantes margin for the fourth quarter. That is almost exclusively driven by change of FX. There has been a strengthening of the Brazilian real particularly after the election of Bolsonaro and whether that holds or not, but it has been \u2013 given us a short term expectation of a stronger real there.","In terms of the synergies, we made a conscious decision not to increase synergies beyond $275 million. And the reason for that was, in our investment thesis which we brought out last year, we said $275 million was the amount we expected to gain by the combination of the two businesses. We fully expect that we will set goals for business improvement beyond that, but we do not believe they are necessarily something that we should call synergies after the original combination of those two businesses. So for that reason, we have looked at this as being a milestone that we're going to leave as it is. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts.","John Ezekiel Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. In Brazil, does the increase in acreage and the shift to soy present any logistical challenges for you to meet demand? Do you have any constraints down there in Brazil given the shift going on?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, John. Look, one of the huge advantages we have in Brazil is our distribution business is well positioned in all of the major agricultural areas of the country and we support and supply farmers for a number of crops. And when we combine that with a production business that is right there as well in the main growing regions, we think we are actually the best positioned to serve the growing soybean market in Brazil, and whether its soybeans, corn or coffee, sugarcane,","we believe our distribution business and our new production business are well-positioned to serve those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar. And your line is open, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hello. Can you hear me? Sorry.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Hi, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning. Can you talk about Plant City operations? Is it safe to assume that that plant is down and probably will come back again? And then, secondly, what is your demand expectation for North America given record crop this year which means record nutrient removal from the ground? And also, the shift from soy to corn, that should add some demand for fertilizers here in North America. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Well, let me talk about Plant City. At this stage on Plant City \u2013 sorry. Thanks, PJ. Let me let me start with Plant City, but Plant City, we're gathering information and we're in active discussions with both the federal and state regulators right now. And we will be in a position before year-end to make a decision on Plant City going forward and that's consistent with where we've been before. And we're really not able to talk about that until those decisions are fully vetted and made.","In terms of North American demand, I think the simple answer \u2013 and Corrine and I were just on a North American customer tour a couple of weeks ago, and what I would say there is you have it absolutely right. The record crops are removing more and more fertilizer from the ground and that is \u2013 meaning that there is an increasing need to replace that fertilizer. So, while we don't expect huge growth rates in North America we do see that market as solid. And now, as the crops continue to grow, we expect a good demand.","The other aspect of it as we saw in this marketing trip was the move towards precision agriculture rather than hurting the demand for fertilizer is probably helping the demand for fertilizer because people are putting the right amount of crop nutrients in the right places, and that is really helping both the demand and the usage of that fertilizer.","Corrine, do you want to touch on anything else?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. The only thing I would add, so we've got our forecasted shipments for North America for Phosphates for 2018 at about 10.2 million tonnes and in 2019 range is 9.8 million tonnes to 10.1 million tonnes so, very similar.","I think, in 2018, what you saw was a little bit of a front-end building of the shipments. After we announced that Plant City closure, people were pretty optimistic about where prices would go and they started loading up a little heavier than a normal shipment. But we expect it to be relatively flat. A little bit the same on the Potash side, there was just a little bit of that inventory build. Mike, do you want to add?","Dr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","No, I guess, the only thing I would add is that, as we said before, both the agronomic and the economic demand drivers remain strong. We've talked about the big withdrawals. But, I think, the another important factor is if you look at new crop prices for corn, soybeans and wheat despite, I think, the perception that things have really changed, if you look at where they're at today versus the last three years, corn prices are kind of at the top of that three-year range, wheat prices are above the three-year range and soybean prices are kind of right in the middle. So, the signals that farmers are getting today are no different than what they have been for the last three years, and that combined with the need to replace nutrients taken out, I think bodes well for the demand outlook for next year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. And I'll just end by saying your final question was about the soy to corn shift. That has a big impact on nitrogen demand. But for us, both of those are great crops and we're pretty agnostic as to which crop is growing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly.","Ashish Gupta - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. It's Ashish for Mark. Beyond the Vale assets, you also picked up the port and warehouse assets in the north from ADM. How have those assets changed your competitive position in Brazil and affected your freight situation?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Ashish. Look, the port position in TIPLAM in particular, I think, is what you're referring to, what that has been able to do for us is now as an importer, we have access to two of very good ports, one in Paranagu\u00e1 state and the one at TIPLAM. And if you think about Brazil and infrastructure in Brazil, one of the key competitive advantages or one of the key competitive issues is access to infrastructure, particularly port infrastructure. So, it is a major importer of both finished product but also raw materials. This really helps us better run our upstream and downstream businesses. And if you look at our statements on synergies, a big piece of the synergies or at least a piece of the synergies has certainly been associated with the upstream and downstream benefits of this infrastructure that we've added.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Most of my questions have been answered, but just wanted to sort of get a sense, you guys mentioned on the prepared remarks that you're seeing some of your competitors tight on potash supply right now. Were you referring to the ramp-ups of some of the future capacity or were you referring to existing competitors, and what does that meant in terms of the amount of time that you have booked maybe in some of those China and India contracts? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think it's both. Certainly, the new suppliers have been slower to come up than one would have expected or one might have might have expected. But also, there has been shutdowns in terms of ICL's ability, as an example, and there has been a refocus in terms of SQM's operations focusing more on lithium and moving away from potash.","And then, of course, there's been environmental issues in Germany that have also impacted supply and even some possible Russian supply which we're not clear on what that \u2013 whether it has or has not. But I mean what we're seeing experientially is a tighter market than we have had previously and that's obviously being reflected in shipment volumes for us and Canpotex, as well as price movement.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer.","Patrick Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Good morning. Question around the capital. So you called out that your debt is now down through the cycle level you need. I was unclear, does that mean you still want to pay down a little bit now or maybe at some future point you would decide to pay down a little bit more as we move maybe to a rollover and towards a trough? And then, on the capital allocation side, you talked about the risk adjustment you make. Could you maybe just highlight if you looked at, say, Fertilizantes versus a stock buyback, what would be the delta in the return that you would need or the risk rate that you would use in those types of investments?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Duffy. Well, let me first highlight. We set a near-term target of paying down $700 million and returning to a debt ratio of below 2.5:1. Now, that's been achieved. As we look the longer term, we are not only looking at what the instantaneous debt ratio is, but how are we positioned throughout the cycle, so not only at the middle of the cycle or the top of the cycle, but also how would we be positioned at the bottom of the cycle. So, we really want to think that through carefully and how we're going to address that before we take any steps to either pay down more or not pay down more debt.","In terms of your question on the risk reduction, rather than hand this to Clint, which I could do, I think what I would say is we would look at share repurchases as being a cost of capital return to shareholders as opposed to an investment of some sort. In terms of the risk-adjusted rate of return, we would have to look at currency risks, geographic risks, technical risks, etcetera, and then say how much above the cost of capital does that have to be for it to be an intelligent investment for us to make.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","So, with that, I would like to thank everybody who's been on the call. But I would like to emphasize before we leave a couple of our key messages. First, Mosaic has made tremendous progress. We've transformed our business and created substantial earnings potential. Secondly, our Phosphates and Potash market fundamentals have continued to be constructive. And third, we're highly optimistic about both the short- and long-term. Simply put, we've created an efficient franchise that is generating strong returns and we expect our momentum to continue to grow.","Thank you for joining the call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - Vice President Investor Relations","Thank you and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; Joc O'Rourke, our Chief Operating Officer who will be taking over as President and CEO tomorrow; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we're using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. We will take a slightly different approach today. I will review our results and discuss current market conditions, and then Rich Mack will provide financial insight and our guidance. Before we take your questions, Joc O'Rourke who will succeed me as Mosaic's CEO effective tomorrow, will provide the outlook for the second half of 2015.","Let's get right to it. Our results for the quarter provide a glimpse of what today's Mosaic can accomplish with even small improvements in agricultural market conditions. We have three key messages for you today. First, the many strategic moves we've undertaken over the past couple of years have created substantial earnings leverage for Mosaic. Second, we are executing our strategy across our operations almost flawlessly. And third, our strong results are just a glimpse of Mosaic's future. The earnings growth trajectory is evident and it was a much greater promise for our shareholders in the years to come.","For the quarter, Mosaic earned $391 million on net sales of $2.5 billion compared with earnings of $248 million on sales of $2.4 billion a year ago. The earnings improvement were driven by a higher conflict sales volumes and higher realized potash prices, in addition to lower operating costs. We earned $1.08 per share; that number benefited from the lower share count resulting from aggressive repurchase activity.","Importantly, we continue to deliver strong operating cash flow with $583 million generated in the second quarter. I would like to point that our earnings per share for this second quarter, net of disclosed items, were higher than our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013, which ended before the breakup of the BPC marketing organization. Potash prices are about $100 per ton lower than they were then, and grain and oilseed prices as well, as grower economics are weaker today.","That's a stark indication of our progress and of our ability to thrive across market cycles. How did we accomplish these improvements? I won't recount all the actions we've taken, but suffice it to say, we made timely, valuable acquisitions and we integrated them seamlessly. We optimized our portfolio by selling or exiting less profitable businesses, which significantly improved our cost structure. We've made good progress on our goal to generate cost savings of $500 million from both operating units and the corporate functions. And we returned meaningful capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I know that Mosaic will not rest on these laurels, but I will leave it to Joc to talk about the future.","Business conditions overall improved during the quarter, but markets have diverged in different regions of the world. In North America, where farmers defied Wall Street expectations and planted enough acreage to deliver another very large crop, overly abundant rain in the Eastern corn belt damaged corps and led to swings in grain and oilseed prices. These recent swings have not changed our expectations for strong second half fertilizer sales.","The spring fertilizer application season in North America played out as we expected it would. Farmers who planted crops fertilized them to maximize yield. However, high beginning channel inventories led to lower sales in North America in the first half. The lone soft spot among our major markets was Brazil, where economic issues delayed fertilizer demand. The volatile real, the weak overall economy, and a temporary freeze on farm credit led to paralysis. Now, with better credit availability and stable grain prices enticing farmers, demand is slowly emerging, which bodes well for our second half of the year.","In India, the strong demand we expected has developed. Second quarter DAP imports were up 178% to 2.6 million tonnes. We increased our expectations and now anticipate that India will import 5.5 to 6 million tonnes of phosphate and 4.5 to 5 million tonnes of potash this year, up significantly over 2014. Indian farmers are enjoying a relatively strong year with ample monsoon rains and good growing conditions in most areas of the country.","Chinese potash demand has also met our expectations and Canpotex is shipping against its record 1.8 million tonne contract.","Overall, this was a good quarter for Mosaic and for the agricultural markets in most of the world. For quite some time, we have been demonstrating Mosaic's resilience in tough times. And now, we are beginning to see the power of our franchise in better markets.","Now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rich Mack, for more insight into the quarter, our capital, and our guidance. Rich?","Richard L. Mack - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jim. With this as your last earnings call, on behalf of Mosaic's 9,000 plus employees across the globe, thank you so much for your dedicated leadership and service to Mosaic. We will certainly miss you.","Now, turning to business for the quarter, I'll begin today with some detail on our three operating segments. The Phosphates segment continued to generate strong operating results, with high sales volumes and relatively stable prices for both our finished products and raw materials. Market forces are only part of the story in phosphates. Our improved margin rate in the segment was also driven by high operating rates, excellent cost control, and solid day-to-day operating performance.","The average DAP selling price during the quarter was $450 per tonne, down from $465 last year. Raw material prices held their first quarter declines, though we do expect market prices for sulfur and ammonia to increase modestly in the second half of the year. We've been expressing that our Phosphates business underappreciated by the market and we're continuing to make notable strides in delivering results in this segment.","In the Potash segment, our margins remained strong, despite the lack of price improvement. Our MOP cash cost per tonne remained very attractive, at $89 per tonne, which includes $18 per tonne of brine management expenses. These low costs are driven by running our low cost Canadian mines at higher operating rates, exiting higher cost MOP production in the US, a foreign currency tailwind, and by meaningful, durable cost reductions.","In the International Distribution segment, our higher volumes were driven by the ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay, with integration now essentially complete. Lower margins in the segment primarily reflect the impact of declining prices and delayed fertilizer demand in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the weaker local currency on expenses.","Now, I'll move on to our balance sheet and capital. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we are within our targeted leverage ratio range. We have approximately $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter, and Mosaic continues to be a very strong generator of cash flow. We expect this to continue as we reap the benefits of our recent growth investments and expense management initiatives. This cash has driven significant returns for our shareholders as you can see on the slide.","Our capital allocation philosophy, which is balanced between investments for growth and shareholder distributions, is enhancing our growth and contributing to our increased earnings leverage. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Going forward, we expect to continue normal open market repurchases under the remaining $1 billion in authorization with any activity being reported out during our regular reporting cycle.","Now, let's move on to our guidance for the third quarter. In Phosphates, we expect our gross margin rate to remain in the low 20% range. We expect operating rates in Phosphates to be in the mid-80% range. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.1 to 2.4 million tonnes for the third quarter compared with actual sales of 2.2 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2014. DAP prices are expected to be in the range of $435 to $455 per tonne. We now expect full year volumes to be at the upper end of our initial estimate at 9.5 to 10.0 million tonnes.","International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 1.9 to 2.2 million tonnes with a gross margin of $20 to $26 per tonne. We narrowed full year volume expectations to be in the range of 6.0 to 6.5 million tonnes.","In Potash, we anticipate continuing strong global demand. Increased potash affordability is driving increased applications. North American demand is expected to be strong in the second half and we expect Canpotex to ship record tonnes this year. During the third quarter, we intend to produce at reduced rates because of planned turnarounds at our Canadian mines. During this period, we expect to draw down inventories throughout the quarter.","We expect operating rates in Potash to be in the mid-60% range and sales volumes to be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 million tonnes during the third quarter, compared with actual sales of 1.8 million tonnes in the same period of 2014.","With the slower start to the first half of 2015, we now expect full year Potash volumes to range from 8.2 to 8.6 million tonnes. Average realized prices are expected to be in the range of $260 to $280 per tonne with the gross margin rate to be in the low 20% range. Both the operating rate and the gross margin rate are in line with last year, as a result of the lower production rates in the seasonally slower third quarter. Our expectation for full-year SG&A costs also remains unchanged at $360 million to $380 million. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives across the company, and we are ahead of schedule as we work towards our goal of achieving $500 million in savings by 2018.","Our estimate for Canadian resource taxes and royalties has been lowered to $310 million to $350 million in part as a result of a higher expected mix of lower priced standard product. We've also lowered the top-end of our capital expenditure and investment guidance for 2015 with such guidance now being between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. All other guidance ranges remain unchanged.","I should note that projected capital costs for our Saudi Arabian joint venture have been revised, and are now estimated to be about $8 billion, which is about $500 million more than the initial estimates. Keep in mind this is a project finance deal, so our incremental cash equity contributions will be less than $40 million. Nevertheless, the project remains strategic and financially compelling to Mosaic. We considered the potential for costs overruns when we assessed the project and were comfortable with the expected returns even with this higher capital cost.","As a reminder, we expect the ammonia plant to begin operating in mid-2016, which will support construction cash flow needs. The Wa'ad Al-Shamal phosphate complex as a whole, is expected to be the lowest cost facility in the world, and our investment is expected to generate attractive returns above a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. As you can see from the photos, this is a megaproject and a tremendous amount of work is advancing in the kingdom. We will continue to update the market as the work progresses.","So, to close my comments, I would summarize by stating that Mosaic is making measureable progress in our efficiency and operating performance. We are seeing bottom-line benefits and we expect further strength in the second half of this year and beyond. We continue to monitor North American crop development, Brazilian fertilizer demand and Chinese phosphate exports as the major uncertainties in the second half of 2015.","With that, I will turn the call over to Joc for his comments on the remainder of the year.","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Rich. Before I discuss the outlook, I would like to acknowledge Jim's remarkable leadership over the past decade. I am entering my tenure as CEO with an excellent foundation and an extremely promising future for Mosaic, and Jim deserves a great deal of credit for that.","Now, on to our view of the future. Our outlook for the reminder of the year remains positive with good demand from the big four agricultural regions. I'll go through them one at a time. In North America, the extreme wet conditions in the Eastern corn belt have reminded us once again that agriculture is unpredictable. At the start of the season, it look like it might be another record crop. But expectations declined and then recently rebounded again. Despite these swings, today, our products remain affordable and provide good value for farmers. Irrespective of near-time market volatility and swings in sentiment, at Mosaic, we manage for success across the whole cycle and for leverage in good times. The secular trend remains undeniably positive.","In China, demand is underpinned by high crop prices with nearby corn and wheat futures trading at approximately $10 $12 per bushel, respectively. MOP shipments climbed to a record last year and are expected to be higher in 2015. Demand is accelerating.","Phosphates are a different story in China. We expect Chinese exports to be in the 8.5 to 9 million tonne range this year, which is higher than our previous estimate. Global supply and demand is likely to remain balanced, however, due to multiple production challenges in other parts of the world. Our most recent demand forecast is around 65.5 million tonnes. Stable stripping margins in the first half of 2015 offer a good proof point of balanced supply and demand. We will continue to watch closely both the level of exports as well as the broader GDP growth in China.","Elsewhere in Asia, India has been a bright spot. Our expectation for 2015 shipments continues to increase. In addition to second quarter DAP imports at levels more than double last year, industry potash sales in India are up almost 10% in the first half of 2015. This is despite uncertainty about the government subsidy until just a few weeks ago. The Indian government's new budget included few changes for agriculture as expected, but it did provide more certainty for farmers. As a result, we expect continued strong demand in India through the second half of the year with the monsoon season and the rupee on our closely watched list.","Jim described the economic challenges in Brazil. While the country's economy and currency remain volatile, fertilizer demand is emerging with the improving availability of credit and stable global grain prices. Soybean prices in reals are very attractive. And if they are going to plant in Brazil, farmers have to fertilize. Imports in Brazil have been lower than last year, but the new demand is helping Brazil catch up with expectations; that in turn, bodes well for the second half of the year. And as we've done in the past, we continue to play a market leader role, leveraging our global presence and allocating tonnes to maximize value. Most recently, we moved tonnes to North America when Brazil demand was delayed.","So, dynamics are quite different from region to region. Overall, demand for our products is strong and we expect good demand for the remainder of 2015.","At Mosaic, we are focused on the things we can control and we feel great about our progress. We're generating significant value from our long list of strategic initiatives. We're positioning Mosaic on the left-hand side of the global cost curves. We've integrated our acquisitions well and we've returned substantial capital to our shareholders. We have developed a highly resilient model for softer parts of the business cycle and we are beginning to demonstrate substantial earnings leverage in good markets. There will be much more to come from Mosaic and I look forward to discuss our strategy with you in the months and years ahead.","Now, I'll turn it back to Jim to moderate your questions.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, Joc. And operator, we'll now \u2013 we're now open for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Steve Byrne. Your line is now open \u2013 I'm sorry, with JPMorgan.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","BofA. Wanted to ask you about the strategic value of your South American distribution business and do you see opportunities to bolt-on to that other products and other services other than fertilizer distribution and do you have any credit risk in that business?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Steve, and it's great to have you on our call this morning. Welcome back. The strategic value of our investment in Brazil is \u2013 this is one of the most rapidly growing agricultural zones in the world. Bit of a wobble this year with credit issues, with some broader economic issues in Brazil, but agriculture remains one of the real, real bright lights, bright spots in the Brazil economy, and it will continue to be that. So, being in one of the fastest growing agricultural zones with new acres coming in is important to us, number one.","Number two, that is part of the north \u2013 that's part of our home court advantage is the entire Western Hemisphere. Nobody can better serve that market, particularly on phosphates, than Mosaic can. And we look at that as a destination market for our phosphate production produced in Florida and for potash production.","And just a great farm economy, excellent farmers; they understand the value of fertilizers. They need it to produce the kind of crops they want to produce in Brazil, so we can't not be there. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Joc now to speak to what some of the ideas he may have about bolt-ons, and then Rick is going to speak to the credit risk that we see in Brazil. Thanks, Steve.","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Steve. In terms of bolt-ons, obviously our footprint in Brazil and Paraguay offers us a great opportunity. Today, we're focused on our core products. I would say that doesn't say anything for the future where we couldn't look at bolt-ons. We'll certainly be looking at other areas in Brazil where we can expand out to key markets where we're not adequately represented, but those will be relatively small add-ons as opposed to big step-outs.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah, good morning, Steve. It's Rick. We do have credit risk there. We have managed it over the last 15 years very well. There'll always be credit risk in Brazil. We feel real good about the quality of customers we have and the quality of the credit that we offer there.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Next question, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I was looking your slide 24, your potash supply and demand model. And if I read your chart right, you think that the operating rate in Potash for 2015 is above 90%. Is that correct, and is that a fair appraisal of current market conditions?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good day, Joc \u2013 or Jeff, sorry.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Sure.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to turn it over to Mike Rahm to give you some color on that. Thank you.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Hey, good morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","No, that is correct. I think we went through and revised our estimates of effective capacity based on what happened last year. We believe with the big surge in demand most players were operating about as hard as they could. So we went back and revamped our capacity estimates, and the operating rate that we estimate in 2015 is 91%, and that's based on our projected shipments of nearly 60 million tonnes and our estimate of effective capacity of about 65.7 million tonnes.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Jim, then if I could, just a follow-up and...","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Next question, please.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Normally, you have pricing power at these sorts of utilization levels, but this time you don't seem to. Can you comment on that?","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Yeah. I think we talked about some of the delays and deferrals that are taking place in the market this year, plus I think a big factor is just what's happened to exchange rates. Every major supplier of potash around the world is benefiting from the strong dollar. And that I think naturally puts some pressure on potash values. So I mean I think you've seen some of the financial results, where despite the fact that the prices have remained constant or moved down in some markets, profitability remains very good, and I think you can attribute that to changes in currencies.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Moving on to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Yonah Weisz with HSBC Bank. Your line is open.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)","Hi, good morning and thank you for my question. I'd like to ask, if I may, about Chinese DAP producers, who unlike their urea producing cousins, have seem to maintained relatively consistent pricing during 2015. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on why this is the case, maybe discuss reasons for this relative amount of discipline. And perhaps looking into the future, can you see any structural reasons on the horizon for this to change, either for better or for the worse? And if I may, just a small additional question on Ma'aden. You're increasing the CapEx. Do you see Ma'aden at all being delayed?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Good morning, Yonah. I'm going to leave the mic with Mike Rahm and then Rick McLellan will give some color on what he sees happening in the market, and then Rich Mack will speak to your question about the Ma'aden project. Over to you Mike.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Hi, good morning, Yonah. Nice to talk with you again. I don't think it's so much I'd characterize as discipline as just the strength of the fundamentals in the phosphate market. We know that before, that first half Indian imports were up 2 million tonnes and there's a long litany of production outages worldwide. You can start with the closure of Mississippi Phosphates, the Suwannee River plant, the production problems in Tunisia, Israel and you can go on and on of about eight or nine different outages. So frankly, I think, the market needs those tonnes and that's then the pull, much more so then anything going on within China in terms of market discipline or whatever you want to call it.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Hi, Yonah. It's Rick. I just add on to what Mike said, is the one structural change that we see coming is the expected implementation of VAT in China that likely is expected to happen in September and that will put a further floor under export price capabilities.","Richard L. Mack - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And with respect to your third question, Yonah on Ma'aden. We're still targeting the ammonia production to come on line during the third quarter of 2016 with some finished phosphate production targeted by the end of the 2016, but the real ramp-up for phosphate production will happen sometime during 2017.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, operator, on to the next question please?","Operator","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi, good morning.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, P.J.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","(27:43) directed \u2013 thank you \u2013 you said you directed some potash volumes to North America when Brazil was weak. That's kind of interesting. And so in the future, if demand doesn't materialize in the emerging markets, do you think that results in a more competitive North American market?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","P.J., I'm going to have Rick McLellan address that question.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Very good question, P.J., and good morning. Frankly from our perspective, we see globally right now, the demand growth happening in both India and China. And we see that Brazil, when we think about what's going to happen in the second half, the shortfall in Brazil occurred in the first half. So, we're expecting strong movement in the second half there.","I think you're \u2013 you may be also describing what we did on phosphates, where we moved phosphates into North America instead of \u2013 or into India and instead of North America and now we've held back tonnes from going to Brazil into the North American market. So through the year, our ability and our flexibility from our distribution businesses as well as our strong home court advantage, allow us to move product around and not effectively impact the ability of us to service our customers.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And P.J., I'd just like to just reinforce what Rick did say. The optionality we have with the global distribution system, particularly Latin America, Asia, Southeast Asia with operations in India and China, throughout Latin America, it gives us a tremendous flexibility to move product where it's needed, to hold it back where we don't have room or move it to other locations. So, it's something that is really starting to show its value in this organization. Thanks for the question.","Next question please.","Operator","Okay, your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, everyone and congratulations to Joc and Jim. Just want to try to reconcile, you had the lowest cash costs of potash in the quarter, I think that you've ever had. And then, you're talking about a low-20% gross profit margin in the third quarter, which is pretty close I think with where you were in 4Q 2013, which was the post-BPC quarter. So, I'm just wondering if you can talk about the third quarter; obviously, it's going to get hurt by fixed cost absorption with the turnarounds. But if you sort of normalize that, where do you think the comparable cash cost number would be versus 2Q?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thanks and good morning, Vincent. I'm going to \u2013 I'll miss answering all your questions in my free time ahead. You could maybe give me a call at home once in a while and ask what's going on.","I'm going to turn this over to Joc in a moment, but I just want \u2013 and thanks for recognizing what has occurred in our potash costs. We've brought them down tremendously from well over $100 to \u2013 in the $89, $85 range \u2013 and that's with inclusive of brine cost. So, I think it's some of the lowest potash production costs in North America and competitive with just about anywhere in the world. And that was done through \u2013 that didn't happen by accident. There was a lot of work done by our potash business unit, focusing on developing ratable capacity to achieve lowest cost production objective. So, a tremendous job was done; we believe it's sustainable. There will be little blips ups and downs, but we have really found the way to effectively be world cost leading producers of potash. Joc, you can speak to the future.","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Vincent, in terms of quarter three, basically we have our shutdown quarter, where we have a turnaround on all of our big operations in potash during the month of July and August \u2013 or sorry \u2013 August and September basically. But in that, you have exactly what you said \u2013 you have a lot more absorption \u2013 we'll be running at 60%, circa 60% run time versus 90% last quarter. But on top of that, we will also be absorbing all of the cost of the maintenance of those shutdowns. So it is a single quarter event.","Underlying all of that, our costs in terms of our manpower costs, our productivity costs, our equipment costs, they are all significantly down from where they were before. So we feel we're very much on track with our new cost regime and we see that coming back as soon as we get through our shutdowns. But no question, this quarter will be highly impacted by those turnarounds.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. A couple of questions on potash. On slide 28, you show your Brazilian outlook, and you are calling for higher second half shipments year-over-year. Just wondering why that is given the ongoing, I mean, credit's still expensive, the real is weak and potash pricing still seems to be coming down there? And then, if you could just comment on North American \u2013 you show shipments down year-over-year in the second half \u2013 what's going on versus consumption versus inventory drawdowns as it relates to shipment levels?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, good day, Don. I'm going to have Rick McLellan, our Commercial leader, address that question.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah, good morning, Don. On Brazil potash, if you take a look at what's happened in the first half, and then take a look at what our full-year forecast is for demand in Brazil, it would tell you that we're going to have to have a very strong second half shipment of potash. There is still the headwinds on credit; there still is the volatility that's happening with the currency. But through it all, it's a very strong agricultural environment. And there will be a lot of people that want to farm with a pencil and paper, rather than let the farmers decide what they're going to do. And the farmers in Brazil, if they're going to plant a crop and you have to give that as a given, then they're going to have to fertilize. So that's where we expect what's happening there.","In North America, I think it's a function of working through inventory that was built in the first half. And so, we expect kind of normalized shipments in the second half, with the exception of last year, we looked at people filling in that December period. And so year-on-year, we don't know whether people will step in and buy in North America in the second half. And so \u2013 after they get done the fall season \u2013 so we've pulled down our forecast for the back half to reflect that lack of fill potential, that could come in that December period.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you. Just a similar question on, as was just asked with China. On slide 26, you have a fairly large 40% half-over-half increase for Chinese MOP shipments. Is this a functionality of just the delayed contract signing at the beginning of the year and basically some shipments being pushed into 3Q that would have otherwise been in 2Q? Or do you believe that they're continuing to increase application rates \u2013 any sensibility of building inventory \u2013 just any color there would be appreciated. Thank you.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good morning, Chris. Dr. Rahm, why don't you take that question?","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Sure. I think it's much more of the former, Chris. China has contracted by our estimate for firm tonnage of about 7.4 million tonnes for delivery by vessel and that assumes a certain amount of rail deliveries as well. They also have about 1.7 million tonnes of optional tonnage. So the numbers that we showed on that slide reflect the expectation that they will execute on their optional tonnage; and if they do, that totals about 9.1 million tonnes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank GBM","Hi, thank you. I was hoping just to get a bit of an update on MicroEssentials and specifically, can you just talk about how the economics are doing versus DAP, number one. Number two, what is the growth strategy for MicroEssentials beyond Brazil and North America? And then finally, just talk a little bit about your patents and when do those expire and how do you manage that? Thank you.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, good day, Ben. I'm going to turn it over to Rick McLellan in a minute to talk about how we're doing economically, but just wonderful that you asked question about the patent infringement case. Perhaps our GC who's in the room with us today, could add some color, but we got some very positive news last week, that most of the claims, virtually all of the claims have been thrown out by the court reviewing the matter. So, as far as we're concerned, we are in the clear on the patent infringement issue that was before us. So, do you want to say anything to that Mark \u2013 Mark Isaacson, our GC?","Mark J. Isaacson - Secretary, Vice President & General Counsel","Sure. Thanks Jim. Yeah, I would just add that the litigation that we're involved in, the federal litigation is \u2013 has been on hold for a number of years while the plaintiff's patent claims have been reviewed at the Patent and Trademark Office. And as it stands right now, most of those claims are back for review at the Patent and Trademark Office and have been held to be invalid by \u2013 at this latest review. And so again, I think we'll continue the litigation hold at this point and though the rest of it remains to be seen, but we think we're in a very good shape at this point.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Rick, why don't you talk about the economics. I'm going to have Joc just speak to the production expansion after Rick addresses the economics of MEs (38:20).","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good morning, Ben. On MicroEssentials, we continue to ship on demand in those two key markets, Brazil and North America, although we are developing markets in Central and other parts of South America. And so as we look for future growth, I would say there is still growth potential in North America; we've been constricted by our production capabilities. The key piece for us is the returns for farmers are still there versus their traditional phosphate fertilizer programs with MicroEssentials. So, the ability for the dealer to charge a premium and ourselves is there. As we look at other growth markets that we'd like to look at once we get expanded production that Joc's going to talk about, one of the markets we'd really like to look at that's similar to North America is Europe. And so we're still doing some work on that.","Operator","Your next question comes from...","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry, we're just going to have Joc speak to the question about where we're going with our production expansion, where we're at with that.","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. So, let me finish that whole thought there, Ben, with the \u2013 first of all, the expansion. As you're well aware, we added $225 million of capital about a year ago now, which will take our total capacity up to 3.5 million tonnes. And as Rick says, we continue to have opportunities to grow that product in a number of places around the world.","But let me also take a step back and talk a little about the patents that we have. As Mark mentioned, those patents were being \u2013 the infringement case has been basically thrown out. But more important necessarily than the patent protection is there's a heck of lot of art and skill to producing MicroEssentials. So, we don't necessarily use the patents as the only protection against the IP. There's been a lot of copycats, but what we've found so far is that they haven't competed agronomically. And certainly from a manufacturing perspective, nobody has come close to what we make yet.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. Sorry for interrupting, operator. If you'd carry on with the next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel D. Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. First question is: you talked a bit about pulling tonnes out of Brazil. So the first question would be, there seems to be more pressure on imports coming into the U.S. phosphate market. So, maybe talk about how aggressively you would defend the U.S. market versus some of your other objectives in Phosphate?","And second question is just on, looking over what Potash Corp. is contemplating with K+S, there is a lot of chatter about Potash Corp. would try to get the legacy mine, when completed, into Canpotex. Could you maybe give your thoughts on that, the process, and if you'd be opposed the legacy mine, if built, being put into Canpotex? Thanks.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Joel. I'm going to have Rick address the question on the market in Brazil and then I'll touch on the legacy in Canpotex.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good mooring, Joel. As we looked at the Brazil market, we did, instead of pushing product into Brazil, brought it back, put it in \u2013 we're putting it into place here at home in North America. And frankly, at today's prices, I'm not sure that there's a big amount of phosphates headed to North America. And we're very well positioned to defend our U.S. market.","If you can remember, in the, at the end of the first quarter, we lifted tonnes from the U.S. and placed them in India. We're doing this again so that we don't put pressure on to markets. We didn't want to pressure the North American market; we moved it to India. We don't want to pressure Brazil; we're keeping it in North America. It is our real competitive advantage to be able to take that optionality that we have with our distribution businesses and our home court advantage and use it to help maintain strong market positions. Jim?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Rick. You asked a question about legacy and what would happen if Potash were to acquire K+S. Really no comment and we have no insights on what's going to happen with that, with those \u2013 with whatever discussions or whatever is going on. But legacy in Saskatchewan, if they were part of Canpotex, I don't see what the issue would be. I personally don't see Mosaic having a objection to that happening, and Canpotex is a extraordinary organization in terms of being able to deliver potash to world markets at the lowest logistics costs anywhere, along with the brand that Canpotex has in the market for \u2013 our governance, how we do business, the quality of business. So, I would have a little doubt that others would want to be part of Canpotex if they were producing potash in Saskatchewan. Thanks, Joel.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew D. Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So in Brazil, is there potentially a timing or logistics issue to ship product into the country if demand doesn't pick up soon for their planting window or application window? And then second, going into the back half of this year, it appears the ammonia market may be a bit tighter. Could you just talk about your expectations on the input cost side of things for the Phosphate segment? Thanks.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good day, Andrew. Rick's going to speak to the market question and Brazil and Joc could address the ammonia material costs.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Good morning, Andrew. And the logistics issue that you suggest will happen is happening and the key piece will be is, how backed up and how available product will be able to move into that marketplace. As farmers have put off their buying decisions, they certainly haven't put off their decisions to plant. I think it was interesting yesterday, there was a report out of Brazil that versus previous years, where farmers had sold 5% of their forward crop to get ready for planting, they're at 25%. So, if the farmer will need to \u2013 if he decides to plant and he will plant given all the indications \u2013 he's going to need to apply fertilizer. And the fact that Mosaic has its own port at Paranagu\u00e1 allows us to have an advantage in getting product into that country. Joc?","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Andrew. So on the question of ammonia pricing. There is a fundamental, probably tightening of the ammonia market \u2013 sorry, when I say fundamental \u2013 a slight tightening of the ammonia market that will happen in the second half of the year. Trinidad gas restrictions, ammonia going to urea, et cetera, both will impact ammonia. But we see that as a pretty slight increase in cost of ammonia.","The other one that's probably tightening at the second half of the year is sulfur, where if Indian demand \u2013 or sorry \u2013 Chinese demand continues to be high for sulfur, there's a reasonable differential between North America and international sulfur. So, we could see some strength in the sulfur price as well. However, in sulfur, with the building of our own melter, we should really be able to change the dynamic of that for Mosaic. So we're seeing slightly higher prices, but I don't believe it's going to hurt our overall stripping margin by all that much.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good. Thanks, Joc. Operator, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you, and congratulations, Jim. You're certainly going out on a high point with these numbers. Two things. First, can you tell us about the impact of Brazil on your working capital and seasonality? I know there's never going to be any such thing as normal in Brazil, but you must have thought something about it as you decided to expand your system? And the second question is, can you tell us about logistics issues in the U.S. and whether that's meaningfully impacting your plan for this upcoming quarter?","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mark. And good to hear from you and thanks for that positive comment. I'm going to have Rich Mack, our CFO, speak to the impact of what he is seeing on working capital in Brazil, and then Rick or Joc can speak to the logistics questions impacting North America.","Richard L. Mack - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So Mark, yes. I mean part of analysis and something that we're measuring is working capital needs in Brazil. One, it's high season down there upcoming and second, our footprint is bigger and so we're very mindful of that and we want to be as efficient as we possibly can on working capital going forward. We're still getting our grounding with respect to the acquisition, of finalizing the integration of ADM, and to date we haven't seen any anomalies that have been outside of our expectations with respect to what's going on with respect to working capital.","James O'Rourke - Executive Vice President-Operations & Chief Operating Officer","Mark, in terms of your question about logistics in phosphates, with the heavy rains we've been having in Florida that could have some impact on logistics. We don't expect we won't be able to \u2013 we expect we will be able to work through that \u2013 but it's always a risk. In terms of our potash shipments, we really don't see anything on the horizon; we're clearly going to be drawing down inventory because of our turnaround schedule. But in general, we don't see logistics being a big impact for quarter three. Those are normally, if they're going to hurt us, will hurt us in that quarter four and first quarter where we have the winter months in Canada.","James T.

Maybe the question first, and I don't \u2013 and I apologize I jumped on the call late \u2013 but I wasn't clear from what was in the press release and the slides, how, if at all, your 2015 global potash view had changed? And specifically, wanted to understand the drivers of the lower reduction in potash shipments for the year, is that just North America domestic shipments? And then finally, how has the view on Southeast Asia changed given some of the pressures in palm oil and some of the currency pressures there? Thank you.","James T.

We have narrowed our shipment range from 58 to 60 million tonnes to 59 to 60. And I can tell you that our point estimate right is at the very upper end of that range. And as we noted in earlier question, our assessment of effective capacity is a little bit over 65 million tonnes. So that results in an operating rate of about 91%. So, we think fundamentals remain constructive or positive. I think we noted on another question that prices have not \u2013 have softened a bit \u2013 but I think that's symptomatic of the fact that all major suppliers are benefiting from a very, very strong dollar.","James T. Prokopanko - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. With that \u2013 and thank you, Mike \u2013 with that, I'll conclude this call. First, please allow me a brief personal note here. The decade I've been spent \u2013 I've spent leading Mosaic \u2013 has been one of the most fulfilling times in my long carrier in agriculture and I'm pleased that I've got to know so many of our investors and really got to know them quite well and analysts around the world. Thank you for your interest in and your confidence in Mosaic and its future.","Mosaic today, hardly resembles the company that debuted on the market in 2004. We've built the best combination of talent, assets, financial strength and global reach in the crop nutrition industry. Mosaic is in excellent shape and is poised for tremendous success in the year ahead as the world's leading crop nutrition company. And my last bit of advice to those on the phone, don't bet against Mosaic and don't bet against the world's growing appetite for food.","I look forward to contributing as an Advisor and Director with Mosaic until next year and look forward to watching Mosaic's extraordinary progress over the many years to come.

[Operator Instructions] Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal year 2012 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. Joc O'Rourke, Executive Vice President, Operations; Rich Mack, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary; and Rick McLellan, Senior Vice President, Commercial. After my introductory comments, Jim will share our views on Mosaic's results, as well as current and future market conditions, and Larry will discuss key drivers of the segment results, as well as provide insight into future raw material costs. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management\u2019s beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date, March 29, 2012, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks, Laura, and welcome, everyone. While we faced market headwinds during the third quarter, our accomplishments in this period reflect Mosaic's ongoing business strength and our great capacity for execution. We reached a settlement agreement with respect to our South Fort Meade permit litigation, which was approved by the courts yesterday, March 28. We expect to be at full production at South Fort Meade in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Our investments to expand capacity at both Potash and MicroEssentials remain on track and on budget. Our operational excellence programs continue to bear fruit, with newly identified initiatives in Potash having already exceeded $60 million in potential benefits. And in Phosphates, we have had record year-to-date production at our Four Corners mine, and our Wingate mine performed at record levels in January. As well, we continue to take steps to realize the value of our exceptionally strong balance sheet by increasing our regular annual dividend by 150% to $0.50 per share. ","In Phosphates, we saw an acceleration of sales in both our future price deferred programs and other sales programs after phosphate pricing in North America bottomed in January. In Potash, we are just beginning to see the pickup in sales. Lower potash sales were reflected in both our reduced third quarter guidance and our final results. That said, we have product positioned in the marketplace ready for growers to apply in anticipation of what we expect to be a strong North America spring season. I'll provide more thoughts on this topic shortly.","We've seen resolution of some major uncertainties that have been impacting market sentiment. The changes to the Indian crop nutrient subsidy are now known, although there remains some uncertainty as to the ultimate demand impact. Even with the announced cuts in subsidies, fertilizer prices on the farm may actually decline depending upon the impact of the Indian currency and the recent decline in spot prices for DAP, FOB Tampa. Our forecast for Indian DAP shipments reflect this and are expected to rebound 4% during the Indian 2012, 2013 fiscal year.","As announced last week, Canpotex and our Chinese customers have reached agreement on a new first half 2012 contract for delivery of 500,000 tonnes in the second calendar quarter, with a customer option for an additional 200,000 tonnes in the same period. The price is unchanged from the previous contract. This contract resolves another uncertainty with respect to the near-term potash global supply and demand outlook. Finally, we saw ammonia spot prices decline dramatically this quarter. These events demonstrate that the near-term challenges are diminishing, while both the near- and long-term outlook remains positive. We continue to expect a strong spring season in North America and significantly improved fourth quarter financial performance. ","Farm economics remain compelling. The December 2012 corn price is around $5.40 per bushel, which is higher than similar contracts in 3 of the past 4 years at this point in the season. Soybean prices have also rebounded, up about $1 per bushel since January, as the 2 grains compete for planted acreage. ","We're estimating another year of high farm income in North America, the second highest on record, and strong farm economics around the world. This is truly a global market, with non-U.S. events capable of driving grain and oilseed pricing even higher. In the current year, we're seeing heat and drought in South America impacting the prices for corn and soybeans. As always, grain and oilseed price trends will have a significant impact on farm economics and our business outlook.","Nutrients remain very affordable. We fully expect that the necessary nutrients will be applied to maximize yields this crop year, and we expect potash demand to accelerate very soon. ","At Mosaic, we have our potash stocks well positioned to take advantage of emerging demand. In addition, we're seeing an early start to applications in the Northern Corn Belt, accelerating the pace of demand for all nutrients. Temperatures have been setting records, snow cover is gone, and the fields are mostly dry. While it may be too early to think about planting spring crops, growers now have early access to the fields to apply the necessary crop nutrients. ","Our fourth quarter guidance reflects our favorable outlook for the spring season. For Potash, we're expecting sales volumes to rebound to 1.7 million to 2.2 million tonnes. The average MOP selling price is expected to be down from the $453 average for the third quarter, solely reflecting changes in the mix of grades and geographies served. ","For Phosphates, we're expecting sales volumes consistent with third quarter. Pricing is expected to decline modestly but will likely be offset by similar declines in our raw material costs. As a result, we expect fourth quarter margins in Phosphates to be roughly equal to the third quarter. ","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Larry to provide some insight into our segment results and raw material costs. Larry?","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim. Our results this quarter reflect the normal seasonality of our business, as well as near-term challenges in Potash volumes and Phosphate raw material costs. ","Consolidated revenues were down slightly, driven by a 27% decline in Potash net sales, which offset a 13% increase in Phosphate. Revenue growth in Phosphates was primarily driven by sales volumes, which were up 9% and at the top end of our guidance range. ","Average realized DAP prices were about flat and within our guidance range. MOP pricing was up a strong 27% year-over-year toward the upper end of our range, but sales volumes were down 41%. We expect sales to accelerate as we move into the North American spring season. ","The consolidated gross margin at $522 million or 24% of sales reflects the lower proportion of Potash in the business mix during the quarter, an outcome of lower Potash sales volumes. In addition, the Phosphate margin of 16% reflects the peak ammonia pricing we saw from September through December, which is now flowing through our income statement. We continue to experience slightly higher cost from the 2011 Faustina ammonia plant outage, but the negative impact of this in cost of goods sold, net of a related insurance recovery in the same line, was immaterial at $2 million.","Earnings also included a number of notable items, which are detailed in our press release. Combined, these items negatively impacted pretax earnings by $48 million and earnings per share by $0.08. Two of these items, the $13 million charge for the South Fort Meade settlement and the $20 million charge for retiring higher cost debt, stemmed from actions that will drive future positive benefits. The $29 million in benefits from insurance proceeds provides partial compensation for earlier higher costs associated with the Faustina outage. ","Lastly, the $44 million in foreign currency transaction loss is a noncash charge and was primarily driven by changes in the Canadian to U.S. dollar exchange rate.","I'll move now to segment details starting with Potash. As the chart on the right shows, lower volumes were clearly the biggest driver of the year-over-year decline in Potash segment operating earnings. The 49% gross margin has slightly improved from the second fiscal quarter, although lower than the year-ago quarter. ","Higher Canadian resource taxes were driven by the significant year-over-year decline in capital expenditures, as we wind down major projects at both Esterhazy and Belle Plaine. The other category in the waterfall chart reflects a prior year benefit of $38 million from insurance proceeds and in the current period, higher plant costs due to both absorption and inflation and higher brine management cost. ","Note that third quarter production volumes were similar to the second quarter, with the second quarter affected by the Colonsay turnaround and the third by our announced curtailments. We began the quarter with low inventories and produced more than we sold in order to position inventory to take advantage of emerging demand. ","For Phosphates, year-over-year sales volume increased 9%. Sales volumes were strong for our third quarter, which is seasonally slow, at 2.6 million tonnes compared to 2.4 million tonnes last year. ","North American production volume was flat with last year, including the impact of our previously announced curtailments. Gross margins declined to $259 million or 16% of sales due primarily to the increase in raw material costs. As Jim indicated, we've seen declining raw material spot prices, which we expect to benefit our results in the fourth fiscal quarter. These cost declines should offset expected lower selling prices and leave gross margins flat in the mid-teens.","Over the past year, Phosphate cost increases have been exacerbated by the delay at South Fort Meade and the Faustina plant outage. We have now largely put these issues behind us and continue taking actions to reduce costs, improve our operating performance and position this business for long-term success. ","As shown on this bridge chart, year-over-year raw material costs lowered operating earnings by approximately $225 million, more than offsetting the price and volume-driven increases. Of the $225 million, $70 million was due to higher ammonia costs, $60 million to higher sulfur costs and $35 million to higher rock costs. The remaining increase in costs was primarily from components of our international blends that we purchase from third parties. These costs are passed through in higher end product prices, with little impact to margins in the segment.","The next few slides will provide more detail on raw material cost trends, starting with ammonia. This historical look shows both the average spot price for ammonia, as well as the price reflected in our cost of goods sold. It demonstrates the lag effect between purchases and realization. ","The average price of ammonia in our cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $589 per tonne. This higher cost includes the impact of purchases made in late calendar 2011 and the fact that we obtained only a partial benefit from our Faustina ammonia plants. ","Ammonia market prices fell significantly in the third quarter, and this will benefit our fourth quarter cost of goods sold. In addition, we expect the full benefit from ammonia manufactured at Faustina. ","Turning to sulfur. We expect a modest decline in fourth quarter realized costs. Our average purchase price in the third quarter was $211 per long ton, and the most recent contract price was $172 per tonne. These lower contract prices will be flowing through cost of goods sold later in the fourth quarter. ","Cost reflected in our P&L include $10 to $15 per tonne in transformation, storage and transportation costs. For rock, our average price per tonne was roughly flat with the second fiscal quarter. We expect rock costs to remain flat in the fourth fiscal quarter before declining in fiscal 2013 due to the ramp-up of South Fort Meade. For fiscal 2013, we expect our third-party rock purchases to range from 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes, less than 50% of our fiscal 2012 purchases. ","Before I turn it back to Jim for his concluding comments, I want to spell out some revisions to our annual guidance. For capital expenditures, we've narrowed the range, lowering the top end of the guidance from $1.9 billion to $1.7 billion. We have not revised either our SG&A guidance or our effective tax rate guidance for fiscal 2012. We have lowered our estimate for Canadian resource taxes and royalties from a range of $420 million to $470 million to a range of $310 million to $360 million. Recall that this is estimated for the calendar year and then reflected in our fiscal year guidance. The decline in our estimated Canadian resource taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily reflects the lower sales volumes we've had so far this calendar year, as well as our expectation that North American dealers will target minimal inventory levels at the end of the season. ","In addition, brine management costs at our Esterhazy mine ran ahead of our guidance in the quarter. While inflows remain well within historical ranges, results for the quarter include higher costs associated with the introduction of advanced technologies, including horizontal drilling techniques. ","We plan to continue to enhance our understanding, management and mitigation of recent inflow patterns and disposal of brine removed from the mine. As a result, planned brine management costs will remain high but decline to between $45 million and $55 million for the fourth fiscal quarter. ","Back to you, Jim.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks, Larry. So while the environment was challenging in the third quarter, we've continued to focus on execution, on our investments and ensuring we are positioned to take advantage of what we expect to be a much stronger fourth quarter. ","For Phosphates, demand drivers are positive, and we are still forecasting record shipments for 2012. While the supply side remains uncertain, we are expecting only a modest impact from Ma'aden and see the potential for a significant decline in Chinese exports. ","For Potash, the recent demand pickup is broad-based. As we've said in the past, we expected a slow start in 2012, followed by a strong finish, and this is exactly what we're seeing today. ","Peak North American shipments are likely to materialize in April through May. Shipments are expected to be brisk in Brazil, Indonesia and Malaysia through June. Production is likely to increase in response to this demand, and at the same time, producer inventories are expected to decline over the next 90 days. ","During the last 3 months, I've traveled the world extensively and visited customers in our markets, and I must tell you that despite the recent lull in market activity, I remain confident about Mosaic's opportunities, our position in the industry and our ability to create value. ","We took our Board of Directors to India. During that trip, we visited several small farming operations where we saw Indian growers using our MicroEssential products to improve the yields of their mustard and potato crops. It was clear to me that despite the Indian government's struggle with fertilizer incentives, the Indian growers see the value in our products. To these farmers, it is all about increasing yields and quality of the crops they produce. ","On a recent trip to Argentina, I visited a large farming operation in the humid Pampas region. It was impressive to observe these growers experimenting with fertilizer technology and application techniques, striving to improve their yields of soybeans, wheat and corn. Clearly, these growers received the message from the global grain markets to increase their production to meet ever-increasing demand. ","And in travels in North America, Canadian and U.S. dealers are telling me that they're expecting an outstanding, if not a record, spring season. Our products play a crucial and valued role in helping all growers to meet their goals. There is simply no getting around the world's ever-growing need for grains and oilseeds, the role crop nutrients must play in meeting those needs and Mosaic's superior positioning to help meet growing global demand. ","With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","A question on global potash demand. And have your thoughts changed at all from what you presented in Tampa, i.e. that global potash demand would be somewhere between 54 million and 56 million tonnes?","James T. Prokopanko","No, we haven't changed our thinking on the outlook for potash going forward. The 54 million, 56 million range still holds.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just moving on to pricing. With China selling at $470 a tonne, have you seen any pressure in other areas of the world like Brazil, India or Southeast Asia as far as a reduction on pricing?","James T. Prokopanko","Jacob, I'm going to ask Rick McLellan, our leader of our commercial operations, to address those questions -- that question.","Richard N. McLellan","What we've seen in other marketplaces is more the acceptance of existing prices rather than pressure on prices. So in Brazil, there's business closing at that $530 level. That's the published price. And we're seeing other markets around the world start to move basis that -- the closure of the Chinese contract.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. So if I heard you correctly, you said that India phosphate shipments are going to increase 4% next year. I was just wondering, can you update us on your India potash forecast and maybe also talk about the timing for the PhosChem DAP contract?","James T. Prokopanko","That's Rick McLellan's project as well, and he'll tell you what he's up to on that.","Richard N. McLellan","I'll start with India PhosChem. The last 2 shipments of the 2011, '12 contract are being made in March as agreed to, and we're in negotiations now for shipments for the next contract. And discussions are underway, and we expect kind of orderly closure in the next 60 days on that contract. And the second question was on potash, our expectations of potash in India. We are -- we're seeing that shipments are beginning now on the product that had been held up being shipped on the old contract. And we expect an increase in potash to around 4.8 million to 5 million tonnes next year, and they're going to work through this inventory that's going to get shipped this quarter. So it'll probably be August before we see any contract negotiations begin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Jim, 2 questions. First, can you talk about when we should expect to see meaningful impact from the operational excellence program over the next, say, 4 quarters? Are we going to see your margins start to outpace what we're seeing across the industry in calendar 2012? And then the second question is just, I'm looking for a little clarification on the potash price guidance. I would have thought that the mix shift would have left you flat to slightly up, but you're saying it's going to be slightly down. So I'm just wondering if you could help us with that.","James T. Prokopanko","I'm glad you've taken notice of the operational excellence programs momentum project in Potash business and ROICworks! This is something we've been driving for, for the last 18 months. And we are seeing some real transformational change in just the nature of our operations, the reliability, the safety, the productivity of our facilities. And this is now turning into some direct bottom line impact. I'm going to have Larry add some precision to that last part of that question.","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Yes, Mark, we are, in fact, seeing a lot of progress in Phosphates. I think the Phosphates team with Joc's leadership has done a terrific job of holding cost increases flat, with the primary factor influencing our margins in the last 1.5 years being raw material cost trends, the South Fort Meade issue and the ammonia plant outage in Faustina. With those 2 major issues largely behind us, we should be seeing improving margins as we head into fiscal '13. I gave you a pretty extensive overview of the raw material cost trends that we'll see playing out over the next quarter or 2. But beyond that, we think the trend should be positive for gross margins, with the added benefit of the operational excellence initiatives taking hold. In the Potash business, as we outlined for you at the Analyst Day in February, we're just getting underway. We've already identified some $60 million of possible improvements that we'll begin seeing impacting the P&L as we head into fiscal 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Olga Guteneva - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Olga Guteneva sitting in for Jeff. If you could help us with the potash price assumptions for the next quarter, I'm a little bit puzzled because you have prices of flat to a little bit down sequentially. And North America looks like about $500, and some offshore markets are about $500. So are you expecting relatively lower domestic sales and higher sales to the, say, lower-priced offshore markets? How do you get to this low range in Potash?","James T. Prokopanko","That's one we didn't answer that Jeff asked -- that Mark asked just before you. So Rick McLellan will address that.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, on Potash in our guidance, it really is about the amount of standard product that we're going to be moving compared to what we did in the -- in our Q3, and that's what the difference is. Prices, we don't see as any different, and -- so our netbacks are impacted by lower-priced standard product.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Elaine Yip from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Elaine Yip - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So with respect to your Potash volume guidance, the range seems to be a little wider than normal. Can you comment on the assumptions that drive the low end and the high end of the range? And then on your 2012 Potash demand outlook for the year of 54 million to 56 million tonnes, it implies a fairly robust rest of the year. And how do you reconcile that when distributors seem to be exercising more caution and they indicate that they want to end this spring season empty and the grain price outlook is rather uncertain?","James T. Prokopanko","Elaine, I'll have Rick answer the first question about the Potash ranges, and then I'll just address the -- your question about demand.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, when we looked at the ranges, we've had several things that caused us to have a wider range. There's several uncertainties given how North America will end the spring, and that's probably the biggest thing that led to us putting a wider range in place. In North America, we continue to hear people want to end the season empty. So we're going to go through a de-stocking of inventory in the system. And should that happen, the restocking happen earlier, that -- then we'll be most definitely at the high end of our range.","James T. Prokopanko","Elaine, on that question about demand, the 54 million to 56 million, and you're right to notice that. It's -- what Rick was saying is the pipeline has been -- we anticipate the pipeline in North America will be largely empty at the end of May. And what we are seeing in our quarter, March, April, May, our fourth quarter, is March was soft, although picked up in the end of this month, seeing noticeable tick-up. And April and May will be very strong, but there is a great sense of risk avoidance by the dealers in North America, and I think that plays out around the world. Dealers don't want to have any excess inventory or take excess price risk on inventories in a world where there's still some uncertainty about what's happening to grain and oilseed prices. So the nature of the supply chain has just become much more cautionary. That doesn't mean that there's going to be any less use by farmers. We see the farm economics to be very, very strong. In most every crop around the world, farmers are still getting the market signals that they have to produce maximum crops. And we anticipate that the farmers will buy, and that will bring it through the system. And we just have to be on our game, and we are. We're well positioned. We have stocks and inventory and positioned ready for when the dealers come to the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Edlain Rodriguez from Lazard Capital Markets.","Edlain Rodriguez - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Just one quick question about potash cash cost. I mean, this quarter, it was, what, like $146. The quarter before, it was $178. Like how should we think about 4Q?","James T. Prokopanko","Larry Stranghoener, our CFO, is ready to answer that question.","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Well, the biggest variable, Edlain, as you know, affecting cash cost in the quarter would be volume. And we certainly were producing at a relatively low volume in the third quarter. We expect production volume to increase modestly in the fourth quarter. And as that happens, we should see improving cash costs, and the same is true as we head into fiscal '13. If we see global demand, as Jim just described, the 54 million to 56 million tonnes, we would expect to be operating in fiscal '13 at fairly high operating rates, which should spell favorable trends for cash costs.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Jim, a question on Phosphate pricing. I mean, you've got lower pricing there sequentially in fiscal fourth quarter for your guidance, but 2 things. One with domestic pricing and metric tonne equivalent being above $500, strong domestic season and with some lag from previous quarters, I'm just wondering why the price is so low. Did you lock in some lower prices domestically through the FBD [ph] program?","James T. Prokopanko","Rick, would you take that question?","Richard N. McLellan","Yes. No, we didn't forward sell into this market. The biggest thing that's going on with our guidance is, we probably have more product being sold out of the river than we do out of Central Florida for this time of the year, and that's pulling it down a bit. You are right that the export price is at $500. We closed on some sales yesterday into the export market at $500. And frankly, we see the opportunity for the market to strengthen from where it is today as we get demand coming stronger in North America. And there's a fair bit of pent-up demand around the world for phosphates.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Market, Research Division","Just 2 questions. Could you please talk a little bit about your consignment strategy? Is this only for Potash in North America or does it also include Phosphate as well? And maybe just give us a little bit of an idea in terms of how much consignment product is out there in the market right now. My second question is just understanding DeSoto mine. And is that different than Pine Level? Is Pine Level gone? I noticed that there's about a 70-million-tonne reserve difference between those 2 projects.","James T. Prokopanko","Again, Rick will speak to the consignment programs, FBD [ph] programs that we have, very effective programs that are an important part of having us very well positioned in having product available when dealers -- when farmers start walking into the dealers. And then Rick McLellan, will -- or, I'm sorry, Rich Mack, our GC that leads our permitting efforts, can add some definition to your question about DeSoto versus Pine Level. Rick?","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, the program that we have is -- separates the delivery of product from pricing, and it's described as consignment, it's not. So from -- on a relative basis, as Jim says, it places product where it's needed and then allows people to price basis, different pricing agreements at a later date. The -- we don't see much more inventory in place with that program than we did last year on Phosphates, and our Potash program is similar to the way it's always been. Product is moved to warehouses, and people buy from there depending on market conditions.","James T. Prokopanko","Rich?","Richard L. Mack","And Ben, with respect to your question on Pine Level, the DeSoto mine is part of the Pine Level mine, and it will be in 2 different phases. So the $70 million shortfall likely would fall into the Phase 2 category, and that's why you're recognizing it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is James Sheehan sitting in for David. I have a couple of questions. Just wondering on the mix change that you identified in Potash. You've mentioned the potash grade mix that you're expecting to change in Q4. I'm just wondering if there's any outlook on geographic mix change due to the recent Sinofert contract to perhaps providing optimism that demand and prices are moving higher globally. And my second question is related to the potash production curtailment that you've got in place for February to May. Since you're expecting demand to pick up in general, do you expect that these curtailments will be completed in May and you'll be resuming sort of a normalized operating rate at that point?","Richard N. McLellan","It's Rick McLellan. I'll take that. When we talked about being more standard, I should have mentioned that, that's the impact of the increased shipments to China, which are the lion's share, which are standard.","James T. Prokopanko","Jim Prokopanko. The question about the curtailment, and yes, we are -- we've balanced our production to match demand. And when we see a movement into the country and looking for replenishment of those warehouse stocks, we're prepared to bring up our Potash operations to match that. It doesn't take much for us to get the Potash operations back up to full production from a full stop. It's no more than 10 days to 14 days to get into operation. So as soon as we get the signals that they're strong, robust, draw of a product, we will be -- we'll be supplying.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","It seems like your North American Potash deliveries for this fiscal year will be just over 2 million tonnes. That's down from about 3 million, a little over 3 million tonnes in last fiscal year, which was up from a little over 2 million tonnes, the fiscal year before. So what is sort of a normal run rate here for North American Potash business for volume, excluding, of course, the repatriation of Esterhazy tonnes you're going to get here? And the second question I would ask would be, you gave a little bit of guidance on what you expect to purchase for merchant rock in fiscal '13. Maybe you could talk about longer term what your views are for purchased rock in terms rebuilding some of your inventories, maybe extending the mine life of your Florida for rock mines and also for defending the rock market, enhance the DAP and MAP market?","James T. Prokopanko","I will address your last question first on the purchased rock and what our plan is, and then we'll address your Potash question. And I think Rick or Larry will be looking at some data to reference that. The purchased rock, we've always and for a long period of time have augmented our mined rock with purchases from suppliers, most typically OCP. We intend to continue to buy from OCP, and as long as they continue to sell to us, we have a great relationship with them. They're a good supplier, and we're a good customer. Investing in the Miski Mayo Mine has allowed us to reduce the need for external rock purchases. And the South Fort Meade situation, the last 1.5 years as we waited for the permitting, we've had to buy more than we typically would buy either from Miski Mayo or OCP. So going forward, I think we intend to have a balanced source of supply, buying product from OCP, sourcing from Miski Mayo. We don't give guidance about on that, but the range you can expect is anywhere from 0.5 million tonnes of purchased rock to 2 million tonnes of purchased rock. What we like about the OCP rock is that it is a high-quality ore, high-quality rock. It serves in our blending purposes, helps with our production operations and having the diversification of supply availability. If there's other interruptions at Miski Mayo, serves us well. So I'd say in the range of 0.5 million to 1 million tonnes now that South Fort Meade's fully operational. The question about inventories, it served us well, having a large inventory going into the South Fort Meade permitting process. A good lesson learned there. So we'll continue to have appropriate inventories to serve again, should there be any interruption from mining. I'm going to pass the question about the Potash now to Rick.","Richard N. McLellan","Okay. The -- what you need to look at for our North American business is -- on a long-term basis is somewhere between 3, 5 and 3, 9 for our Ag business. Now the real question is, as you look at this year, we need to focus on the fact of -- that there is inventory out there. People are going to buy kind of hand-to-mouth as we go forward, and they will end this season. So looking at this year as an example, they'll end this season at relatively low inventory levels. So be careful looking at this year as an example of what a long-term run rate would be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Ted Drangula","This is Ted Drangula in for Vincent. I guess following up on your Potash volume guidance or continuing into fiscal '13, would you expect a stronger than usual June time frame or the June through August time frame? And then does the -- I guess the other thing I'm trying to connect is, does your 54 million to 56 million metric tonne global volume guidance, does that include a restocking by dealers at some point during the year? Or how else do we get to a sort of flattish number in calendar '12 versus calendar '11 if there isn't a restocking effect and then we have 3 to 5 months of the year so far at well below year-ago levels?","James T. Prokopanko","The question about what's going to happen in June, July, August, that's some of the uncertainty that we're facing. And right now, we're at Mosaic into a budgeting process, and it is devilishly difficult to forecast what's going to happen once the plant is -- the crop is planted. Are we going to have 94 million acres or are we going to have 97 million acres? Or are we going to have trend line yields, above trend line or something more like last year, well below trend line yields on corn? And that is all going to contribute to -- and how the crop comes out of the ground will contribute to market sentiment by dealers. So June, I'm not anticipating in North America that we're going to have all that information yet. But if it's off to a difficult start for farmers in North America and we see stronger commodity prices, I think there's going to be pressure building to load up on potash if -- and phosphates. And if we see a bumper crop coming, there might be a little more caution by dealers to just see how this crop plays out with the grain, and then at the end, what the grain price is going to be for the coming year. So that's the tough part, June, July, August. But we know that they may delay, but they can't completely avoid having to load up with both potash and phosphate. Rick, I'll ask you to add some color to that perhaps internationally and other insights you have.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, I think the key takeaway is that people will de-stock. But it's not if, it's when they restock during this calendar year. And so if you look around the world, we see demand very strong in Brazil. When soybean prices are where they are today, growers there in the last 3 weeks, it appears, have bought about 3 million tonnes of blends for this fall's application season for their planting. And that has done a lot to bring them back to the market, looking for both phosphates and potash. So it's going to take a driver like that to make it come, but that demand will come.","James T. Prokopanko","Ted, I'll just add. In general, this is going to be a slow start to the year, unless there's some great surprise in the planting season. Although it's going to be a slow start, it's going to be a strong finish through the balance of our 2012. The product has to get on to these fields to grow the kind of crops that are being demanded by the world. There's no way to avoid it. So it's -- maybe you don't buy it now, but you're going to buy -- they're going to buy it later, and we're prepared to serve that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Michael Picken from Cleveland Research.","Michael Picken - Cleveland Research Company","I was hoping that we could get a little bit more specific color. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about -- that you think there'll be a relatively limited impact from the Ma'aden ramp-up and potentially reduced Chinese phosphate exports, and I was wondering if you could potentially quantify that a little bit more specifically.","James T. Prokopanko","What we have been doing over the last 6 months is we anticipate the Ma'aden startup and look at what they'll be bringing to market. We've been bringing our number down largely on the basis that we just have not seen a large bump in supply from Ma'aden. So our forecast is started at about 2 million tonnes for this calendar year, and we think it's going to be now 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes. So they've got a lot to bring to market to hit the 2 million. It just has not been shown up as a competitive factor in the phosphate markets. But they'll eventually get there. If not in 2012, maybe 2013 they'll get up to full production. In China, recent developments that we've been assessing, but we see reduction of Chinese exports of DAP, MAP, TSP. And we've quantified that reduction from our earlier estimates down from -- I think it was 5 million was what we anticipated what they exported last year. And this year, we see that being closer to 4 million, unless one of my colleagues want to correct me on that, but I expect 4 million.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, Jim, just the amount down is correct. It's 6, 6 to 5, 6.","James T. Prokopanko","To 5, 6, all right.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Andy Cash from UBS.","Andrew W. Cash - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was just curious if you could give us a little more granularity around the restoration of ops at South Fort Meade. I think at Investors Day, you were talking about starting up a dragline, the first one, have it running about this time and then maybe another 6 weeks, a second, then another 6 weeks bring it back to full production. So just curious on how that time line is working. And also if you could -- once you restore Fort Meade all the way back to 100%, what are your plans for production at Wingate and Four Corners?","James T. Prokopanko","Well, I'm going to have Joc O'Rourke, leader of our operations and supply chain operations, to address your question.","James C. O'Rourke","Andy, Joc O'Rourke here. Yes, your time line is pretty much correct. We just got final approval from District Court this week, as we said in our release. So it will take us about 2 weeks to get the first dragline in place and producing. Another 6 weeks after that, we'll have a second dragline in place and producing. So in our first fiscal quarter of 2013, we will be fully operational. In terms of your question about Wingate and Four Corners, we fully intend to run those as hard as we're running those now until at least we have what we would call comfortable inventory levels in our Phosphate operations.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just have a question on -- we talk about the fact that we've had a sluggish start to the year, and that when North American demand really picks up, we should start to see improved dynamics in Phosphates. But to your point, Jim, we are getting some early application, even a little bit of corn already planted in Illinois. I'm just curious what the holdup is and why we aren't seeing more phosphate move already in light of the great economics, the large planting and the early weather window.","James T. Prokopanko","Good question. In spite of these unseasonably warm conditions and even Minneapolis, we -- where normally we'd have still 1 foot, 2 feet of snow to get rid of. On Sunday, we're going to have back up to 80-degree temperatures. Now that's -- farmers have been around long enough to know that, that can change rapidly. So one hesitation by farmers, why they wouldn't be planting more heavily today is, there could still be an early-season frost. And you plant a crop now, you get the moisture, good soil, warm, moist soil conditions. You get a crop up, corn's up, beans are up, and then you get a frost and you lose it and then you have to replant. So that's a very real risk. The other piece is that crop insurance in some of the Midwest states doesn't really kick in, I believe, till early April. And farmers aren't going to plant until they're good and sure there's not going to be an early-season frost nor are they going to plant outside of the crop insurance window. So it'll come. This is still very early, and the farmers are going to be well-prepared, ready to go on the first day that it's reasonable to do so.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Gulley from Gulley & Associates.","Mark R. Gulley - Gulley & Associates LLC","Jim, you referenced these 12 corn contract in your prepared remarks, and you've also talked about favorable planting conditions. I wonder -- I don't know if Dr. Rahm is in the room, but what is his view on farm pricing for corn for this year and how it might differ from what the market is telling us in terms of the -- these 12 contract?","James T. Prokopanko","Well -- and Mike, like half the analysts on the -- that are listed on this call are on vacation, it appears. So Mike can't be with us today. A lot to be played out in this going forward. You see ranges of 94 million acres plant forecast on corn. I've seen some as high as 97 million. Then you see yield estimates that could be sub-160 to -- I've seen one as high as 167. And our view is that depending on the size of the -- the yields mostly will drive prices. So we think the $5 to $5.50 range, given trend line yields and where our trend on corn is 161 BPA, bushels per acre, and we're forecasting approximately 94 million, 94.5 million acres, and I think we'll be able to sustain prices above $5. Now when you start getting into these higher corn acres, 94 million to 97 million acres, these last anywhere from 5 million to maybe high as 10 million acres are in prime corn growing land. You're starting to bring in land that farmers either hadn't previously had under cultivation or they're going to corn on corn or corn on corn on corn, which poses risks in that. So at a 97 million- or 94 million-acre crop, I think it's going to be, and I think Mike shares this view, a real challenge to beat trend line yields when you're bringing in every acre that you have available that you can plant something in. At the same time, we're not -- we're far from done. We need soybean acres planted as well. So you get pressure to go to this 97 million acres of corn. Soybeans are going to fight back, and you're going to see those bean prices go up and take away from corn. So we're not anticipating short of a bumper crop above trend line yields. We're not seeing corn prices slip below $5.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America.","Christopher Perrella","This is Chris Perrella filling in for Kevin. I just wanted to ask, the inventory build for Potash that you had done for the fiscal third quarter, how long do you plan or what's the time frame for running that down back to more normal levels? And then for the MicroEssentials, can you remind me how much capacity you're adding and what your operating rate for MicroEssentials has been?","James T. Prokopanko","Those are 2 good questions for Rick McLellan to address.","Richard N. McLellan","The inventory buildup we're seeing on Potash is, we expect that to be drawn down over the last 90 days. And frankly, when we went into the third quarter, we had relatively low inventories, and we realize that we had to build them up to meet the demand. You can't sell an empty warehouse. And I'll ask Joc O'Rourke to step in and cover the question on MicroEssentials production.","James C. O'Rourke","Chris, MicroEssentials, we are expanding at our Louisiana plant. We're adding 600,000 approximately tonnes of capacity in Louisiana. And perfectly timed question, yesterday, the first production came off that line. So we should have a capacity of slightly over 2 million tonnes of MicroEssentials if and when the market needs it. Yes, and so far, we've sold basically everything we've produced.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Charles Neivert from Dahlman Rose.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question. As you guys move back into South Fort Meade and start taking rock -- more rock out of South Fort Meade, and obviously, the mix of rock that you're going to send to your plants is going to change, is that going to have any, at least for a period of time, a cost impact that you sort of change rock inputs? I mean, obviously, rock is a little different from place to place. So is there an adjustment that you're going to have to do in the Phos asset and the DAP plants? And is there a cost involved that we should be aware of?","James T. Prokopanko","Joc's ready to answer that question.","James C. O'Rourke","Yes, certainly, there's slight differences between the different rocks from the different mines but nothing material. If anything, South Fort Meade has historically been a very good cost operation. And so what we will see is, as we put more of our own rock and less purchased rock through our plants, we'll certainly see our cost come down slightly.","James T. Prokopanko","And with that, we're going to conclude. Everybody, have a great and safe spring season. We're going to have an outstanding year ahead of us, and we're ready for it.

(Operator Instructions).Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2014 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions, after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Rich will share his insights into our results and our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, October 30th, 2014, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","Jim Prokopanko","","Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings discussion. We reported solid earnings for the quarter, given the challenging business environment across agriculture. We drilled progress on costs and delivered good operating performance, while we will provide some color on those results, I realize the elephant in the room is not our third quarter results. The elephant in the room is the near term future, so we\u2019ll spend a significant amount of time there. We want you to take away three important concepts from this call; first, we believe the current negative sentiment that is pervasive amongst agriculture investors is overblown and that the weakness in Ag equities provides compelling opportunity for companies and investors alike. Even the more recent U.S. -- forecast indicate farmer income this year will be the fourth highest in history. The uncertainty is for 2015, where today farmers can still pre-sell their corn for around $4 per bushel and their soybeans for around $10 a bushel.","Second, this is a cyclical business and we at Mosaic have been through many cycles. Agricultural commodity prices are indeed lower. The cycle will play out and prices will rise again. Third and most important, Mosaic is in excellent condition to whether the current economic environment sees opportunities as they arise and outperform when conditions improve.","We manage for the long term, because the long term holds great opportunities for this business. Before I explore those topics in more depth, I\u2019ll provide a bit of an insight into our performance for the quarter. We generated net earnings of $202 million or $0.54 per share on net sales of $2.3 billion, compared with net earnings of $124 million and net sales of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2013.","We continue to generate strong operating cash flow of $489 million during the quarter bringing our year-to-date cash flow to $1.9 billion, a $400 million improvement over the same period a year ago. We are putting our cash to use by continuing to invest in the business and repurchasing our shares while still retaining $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the end of the quarter.","Global demand for potash and phosphates remained strong during the quarter. Our shipment volumes came in at the low end of the original guidance range. In potash because of primarily weather related production issues in Saskatchewan and New Mexico which underscore the tight inventory situation we highlighted on the last call, and in phosphates because of the timing of some quarter and the shipments.","Phosphate prices declined somewhat even as costs rose for raw materials especially ammonia. As we announced last month, we will curtail phosphates production in response to these conditions and we will continue to produce with economic discipline limiting the amount of high cost inventory we carry into the spring season.","In potash, prices improved, and as we discussed during our last call Canpotex was fully subscribed. Customers in North America saw [clock] in potash for fall application early, because of the fears of our overburdened rail system as well as low producer and channel inventory. Indeed potash inventories are very low. We are producing at high rates just to meet current demand.","In terms of global shipments, we lowered both 2014 and 2015 global phosphate shipments forecast by roughly a million tonnes in part due to India importing more phosphoric acid for NPK production and we are maintaining our outlook for global potash shipments.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to our views of the current agricultural markets. Farmers in North America are finishing a record harvest, spurred by mostly favorable economics when farmers were making planting decisions and ideal weather in the growing season across the corn belt. This will be the second bin busting harvest in a row, and while that bounty is good for global food security, it brings with it prospects of lower income for farmers in 2015, so what happens from here? We know farmers are going to farm and when they do we are confident they will follow good business economics and work to maximize yields from every planted acre. Certainly farmers will tighten their belts. We expect land rents to decline, we expect some land to be taken out of production and equipment purchasing decisions to be deferred and we expect farmers to ring every penny a value out of the cash they commit to inputs.","Think about it this way. If you buy a thorough bred race horse, you are not going to try to recoup your cost by not feeding it, so we disagree with the belief among some analysts who suggest potash and phosphate useful crop in 2015. In fact, we expect global demand for potash and phosphates to remain strong and even grow in 2015.","Here\u2019s why, first, the USDA expects the 2014 global harvest to come in a few bushel shy of 3 billion tonnes, a record on top of last year\u2019s record. That much grain takes enormous amounts of nutrients from the soil and those nutrients need to be replaced. When farmers plant their fields, they will fertilize.","Second, precision agriculture technology has made tremendous progress since the last downturn in grain and oilseed prices. Today, in pursuit of maximal efficiency and sound nutrient stewardship farmers test soil and apply precisely the nutrients for soil needs for the next growing season. This approach has the effect with smoothing demand for our products across the cycle compared with earlier cycles.","Third, the argument that unused phosphorous will carry over in the soil from one season to the next is much too simplistic. The phosphorous cycle is complex chemistry but suffices to say that phosphate must be applied for each new crop. The benefit of skipping an application cycle is deminimus at today\u2019s prices, a much different story than when DAP was $1100 per tonne. You can read more about this topic in the most recent addition of Market Mosaic which is available on our website.","And finally, at current prices, potash and phosphate remain affordable just as we want them to be. Our views are playing out in the market. Global demand remains strong until the fall of season for both of our nutrients and prices are stable to reflect the demand. I want to be clear. We fully understand the situation facing grained farmers and we know they will have to make tough decisions as they prepare for the next planting cycle. We also know that this trough of the cycle is the first series dip in many years, so observers who entered the business in boom times are having difficulty seeing a longer horizon, but the agricultural environment can change quickly. One poor global crop would change sentiment and global food security dramatically.","Overtime regardless of the current crop outlook we know that demand for food and crop nutrients will rise and therein lies the opportunity I mentioned earlier. As we demonstrated with our many strategic moves, the engines of growth are cheapest to build at the low part of the cycle. We are making good progress on our strategic initiatives. I\u2019ll provide a few updates. We are on track to complete the acquisition of ADMs distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay by the end of the year. We are well along the process of planning for integration. Once complete the acquisition will enable us to expand our distribution in Brazil from 4 million tonnes to 6 million and capture a bigger percentage of the incremental value from our premium micro essentials products and one of the most dynamic agricultural markets in the world. The remaining potash expansion our key three shots at Esterhazy continues on budget and on time.","We closed the sale of a decommissioned Hersey, Michigan line and have signed an agreement to sell our distribution business in Argentina. We are on pace and realizing the targeted synergies from the CF phosphates acquisition. The proximity of assets and the excellent cultural fit are proving quite valuable. We are also making investments to create further efficiencies in our phosphates business. We are investigating further de-bottle necking for ammonia production because we like the stability of supply we generate from manufacturing a portion of the ammonia we require. We are in the process of converting two granulation facilities to produce more micro essentials. And we are investing in sulphur melting capacity to give us greater sulphur sourcing flexibility ","At the modern project we are ramping up hiring and a significant portion of the capital required for the project will be put to work in 2015. We are already seeing steel and concrete rising from the ground. All these moves contribute to our well defined strategy. They provide us with growing production capacity, increased operational efficiency and growing and a stable market access. We are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments and are positioned for strong volume and cash flow growth as the cycle moves forward.","Finally, I\u2019ll leave the details on capital and expenses to Rich, but I want to mention that our capital structure continues to improve and we are ahead of schedule on our efforts to remove about $500 million in expenses from our two business units and our corporate functions. Now, before I offer some closing thoughts, Rich Mack, our CFO will discuss our results.","Richard Mack","","Thank you, Jim and good morning to you all. This morning I will provide a brief discussion of our business, segment financial results for the third quarter share some insight on our capital and close by providing guidance for the fourth quarter. In the phosphate segment, our results were in line with guidance. Volumes, prices and margin rate were generally consistent with our expectations. We are encouraged with what we see in phosphates and view this to be in increasingly positive story for Mosaic. That said however, and as we previewed in our press release on September 30, we believe that raw material prices particularly ammonia continue to be out of line with the price levels and other agricultural commodities, which is why we decided to curtail some phosphate production during the fourth quarter. This disconnect is compounded by the fact that we are entering a seasonally slow period for phosphate sales.","For clarity, we are going to take a measured approach to the curtailment. We will produce enough fertilizer to meet customer needs and we do not plan on curtailing our micro essentials production. We will evaluate our production levels daily with the objective of entering the spring application season with minimal high cost ammonia in finished product inventory.","In the potash segment our results were close to our expectations aside from isolated production issues, which were primarily weather related. That impacted our operating rate by several percentage points. We lost some production days during the quarter at both Belle Plaine and Carlsbad because of summer storms. While our year-over-year cash cost per tonne were roughly flat, in September for example the potash team delivered cash costs of $103 per tonne, including Brine management cost of $19 per tonne. These costs are at their lowest level in recent years even with lower operating rates and demonstrate that our cost reduction initiatives are beginning to take hold.","Now, I\u2019ll move on to our capital. I provided a fairly in-depth discussion of our capital philosophy a quarter ago, so I won\u2019t repeat all that information today. Instead, I would like to make just a couple of points. First, to reinforce Jim\u2019s message the low [Arkenles] cycle clearly provides opportunities for the strongest companies and Mosaic has a very strong financial foundation. We\u2019ve put a lot of capital to work over the past 18 months and we will continue to do so as compelling opportunities arise. This is how we built this business in my years at Cargill being financially sound and looking for opportunities at the low end of the cycle.","In this regard we have worked hard to optimize our balance sheet with the addition of $2.8 billion of attractively priced debt over the past 12 months including $800 million in the third quarter. We are using this cash to execute on strategic initiative, CF, Ma\u2019aden, the ADM distribution business and an attractive Mosaic share price. On that note we have been repurchasing shares in the open market during our open trading windows as well as through a recently implemented 10b5-1 trading program.","Since our last earnings call we have repurchased 3.5 million shares in the open market. That makes our total share repurchases $2.6 billion in the last 12 months or about 13% of our outstanding share account. Second, as a result of the CF and ADM acquisitions we have decided to slightly adjust our capital management philosophy by increasing our targeted liquidity buffer to $2.5 billion from $2.25 billion as a result of increased working capital requirements. This change increases our on-balance sheet cash target to $1 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, we have approximately $1billion and excess cash above this newly revised liquidity buffer after taking into account cash that will be used to fund the ADM acquisition by the end of the year and funding a trust fund for our asset retirement obligations which is likely to happen sometime in 2015.","Now I\u2019d like to provide our guidance for the fourth quarter which tends to be a seasonally slow period for us. In phosphates we expect margins to be in the mid teens, while operating rates to be in the 70% to 80% range, which is a lower and wider range due to the curtailment we have discussed. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 to 2.8 million tonnes for the fourth quarter. This compares the 3.4 million tonnes in last year\u2019s period when volumes were unusually high as low prices and sentiment changes led to a significant sales in North America. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $450 per tonne.","In potash, we anticipate that our mines will operate at high rates to begin to replenish extraordinary low inventory levels and to meet global demand including and expected new contract with Chinese customers.","In the fourth, we expect to continue to make significant deliveries under the old contract which will increase the proportion of international standard sales in our product mix negatively impacting our expected average MOP pricing.","We expect potash sales to be in range of 2.0 to 2.3 million tonnes during the fourth, compared to actual volumes of 1.9 million tonnes in the same period last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $275 to $295 per tonne.","The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the mid 30% range. Our operating rate in potash is expected to be in the range of 85% to 90%. We are narrowing our 2014 Canadian resource taxes and royalties to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, compared to prior guidance of $170 million to $210 million. And our guidance for full year brine management expenses is unchanged at approximately $200 million.","We are also lowering our estimated SG&A expenses to a range of $380 million to $395 million for calendar 2014, with the midpoint of the range down $25 million from the beginning of the year as a result of our progress on cost savings initiatives.","Note, these numbers include $10 million in charges incurred to achieve these cost savings initiatives, so we are off to a good start on this front. For the year we estimate an effective tax rate excluding discrete items continuing in the high 20% range. We continue to expect a normalized tax rate in the low to mid 20% range for 2015 and thereafter.","And finally, our expectation for capital expenditures and equity investments remains in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion including investments in the Ma'aden joint venture.","In closing, I have a couple of miscellaneous remarks. First as Jim noted, we anticipate that we will close on the ADM acquisition by the end of the calendar year. Assuming that to be case, we plan to manage and report a new international distribution segments starting in 2015.","This approach will provide enhanced disclosure and transparency in our phosphates business, as well as with our larger international distribution business. We anticipate providing you with historical data during the first quarter of 2015.","And second, from time-to-time in my new role I hear questions relating to a perceived remaining overhang resulting from the Class A share held by Cargill family members and trusts. If such a perception exists, it should not.","There are less than 35 million Class A shares outstanding and they are held by several separate and distinct owners and trusts. In November, 2014 just next month 17 million of these shares will convert into freely tradable common shares and a year later all of the reaming restricted shares will also convert to common.","While this diversified group of Cargill family owners and trust will obviously have full discretion over their ultimate disposition we would not expect significant selling given the tax implications associated with these shares.","With that, thank you for time this morning, and I\u2019m going to turn the call back over to Jim for his concluding remarks.","","Jim Prokopanko","Thank you, Rich. The economic environment on the farm has changed. Corn selling at 350 per bushel remains us after a long run of remarkable farm profitability, that food supply can still get ahead of demand, if only temporarily. And tough times for farmers lead to leaner times across the Ag factor. We are ready for this at Mosaic.","We\u2019ve been through $3 corn and $9 soybeans. We\u2019ve been through $200 potash and we\u2019ve seen the over exuberance or $1,000 potash. Through all that, we\u2019ve stayed our course. We will remain confident about the agricultural markets and we\u2019ve made tough decisions when necessary and bold decisions when they held big promise.","Listen, this is a tough business and a tough business to predict. Agriculture is subject to a myriad of forces, economic, social, political, environmental and otherwise. Farmers and agro business make decisions about the future with many variables unknown. But they and we return to the simple concept that the world needs all the food they can grow and it needs a lot more of that food in the coming years.","I will skip the food story details for now and I will let this suffice. Short term volatility is a fact of life in agriculture, but long-term demand growth is also a fact of life and lives. Mosaic is exactly where we wanted to be, and we\u2019ve made bold investments for growth.","We\u2019ve reduced our costs. We build an efficient balance sheet. We\u2019ll become the world\u2019s largest player in finished phosphates and build a strong position in potash. In short, we have built this company to succeed across the inevitable cycles of agriculture.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.","","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","","Matthew Korn - Barclays","Good morning, everybody. It\u2019s quite something to get first in line here. Question for you, if we do maintain acres and we apply proportionally more fertilizers and hold total demand kind of steady, is it fair \u2013 could we be headed for a wall of U.S. stock to use in the grain side, particularly if we see grain export sales may be limited by currency.","And I guess the question becomes would it better for the business over the next two, three years to maybe see a substantial drop in acres this next year instead of planting 1991 and then anticipating an even bigger build in stock the following year?","","Jim Prokopanko","Well, good morning Matthew and congratulations for being number one. And it\u2019s good way to start your Thursday. Your questions, really take a look at regional market North America in what we are competing in is a world market and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Mike in a moment about that. But I believe the world with the demand growth we\u2019re seeing in grain and oilseeds needs to keep their foot on the accelerator to continue to grow the kind of crops we\u2019re growing.","We can\u2019t count on having two back to back or continued back to back record harvests. The record just aren\u2019t there to support that just as we don\u2019t have poor harvest year after year after year, we won\u2019t expect to have these record harvest continuing. So, I think the right thing to do for farmers to take the market signals, produce all that makes economic sense to produce and we\u2019re seeing it play out with the soybean markets with higher than anticipated soybean exports.","So, just looking at the U.S. there\u2019s other things happening whether its Southeast Asia, Latin ","America, Brazil now being challenged with dryer than normal planting conditions which we\u2019ll see how that ends up. But we got to look at the whole market and we have the whole world as a market and not just focused on what\u2019s happening with the U.S. corn and bean crops. Mike over to you.","","Michael Rahm","Yes. Not a whole lot to add Jim, I thought it was a good response. What we say around here is that, we\u2019re one great \u2013 one great crop away from a farm crisis and one poor crop away from a food crisis. And I think that really summarizes the nature of our business that if we knew what mother nature was going to deliver, I think we could answer the question, but we just don\u2019t know, and I think that\u2019s what markets are precisely signaling today that there is so much uncertainty in terms of what could happen that you could get a sharp inventory drawdown next year under a poor crop conditions.","","Jim Prokopanko","I just add to that Matthew, until 10 days ago it was well as me these corn and bean prices aren\u2019t going to find the bottom and we get a few little surprises like higher soybean exports, dry conditions in Latin America and the markets turnaround and we\u2019re seeing 10 or 15 days of some solid improvement in both corn and bean prices. So it\u2019s a really a difficult one to forecast.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotia Capital. Your line is open.","","Carl Chen \u2013 Scotia capitalize","Hi. This is Carl just stepping in for Ben and thank you for taking my question. Jim, can you please walk us through how you see the supply and demand dynamics involved between 2014 and 2015 for both phosphate and potash?","","Jim Prokopanko","Charles, good morning. I\u2019m going to just turn that straight over to Dr. Mike Rahm who keenly follows those supply and demand dynamics and I\u2019ll wrap up with some comments.","","Michael Rahm","Good morning, Carl and thanks for the question. I think in terms of our projections for 2015 you\u2019ve seen our forecast for shipments, we expect that potash shipments will increase from I think our point estimate for 2014 is 57.8, we think there\u2019s another million tonne increase in 2015 to about 58.8 or so. In the case of phosphates we expect to go from the mid 64 million tonne range in to the kind of 66 million tonne range.","So, we expect demand growth maybe slows a little bit from the rapid pace that we\u2019ve seen in 2014. And given that forecast when you lay that up against supply, we see more or less fairly stable operating rates. In the case of potash, I think that translates into about 82% operating rate or so worldwide, in the case of phosphates, about 86%.","So, as we said, our long-term outlook shows a fairly well balanced situation. We think global potash operating rates are going to kind of range in that 80% to 85% range and in the case processed phosphate rates will be in the mid 80% range.","","Jim Prokopanko","Charles, we\u2019re going to add one thing to couple of points to that. 2015 and phosphate is going to be another record year, although we moderated our forecast for the year to be up a 1million tonne less, it\u2019s still going to be up a 1 million tonnes. And if you go back to 2007 the year before the big drop in shipments, we\u2019re shipping 50 million tonnes approximately a year.","Today we\u2019re going to ship 65 million tonnes of finished phosphates. From 2008 we\u2019re up almost 20 million tonnes, and on global potash, again, we\u2019re going to see another record. And if you go to the 2008 year, we\u2019re going to be up 10 million tonnes of potash shipments. So, yes, there is ups and downs, dips and valleys, but the trend is unrelenting. It is upward and it maybe is not every year, but we are seeing continued growth in potash and phosphates with record years being post-expected in 2015.","","Michael Rahm","I think the other thing I would add Jim is that when you look at global grain and oilseed production the big step-up in production pulled a lot more nutrients out of the soil as we mentioned before and that translates into this 8% increase in potash shipments in 2014.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Thank you very much. Can you further elaborate on your strategy for ammonia procurement specifically including some options for potentially debottlenecking of its Faustina and then also your appetite for more longer term index, supply agreements? Thank you.","","Jim Prokopanko","Good question Chris. I\u2019m going to have our Chief Operating Officer, Joc O'Rourke speaks to that, those are projects he is keenly following.","","Joc O'Rourke","Thank you, Chris. Joc O\u2019Rourke here. Yes, we certainly looked at how we add flexibility and let\u2019s call it a natural hedge to our ammonia supply. We believe that by linking ourselves to the relatively high supply of natural gas in North America and low price of natural gas, we can do better in terms of ammonia procurement, and as such we are looking at debottlenecking our Louisiana plant. We believe we can add up to as much as 100,000 tons of gas-based low cost ammonia.","So, we think that\u2019s a really good project. Likewise we entered to a long-term supply agreement for 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes from CF industries that will be natural gas indexed or based. So that gives us a good balance between the ammonia market and natural gas based ammonia. So we feel about the right place.","","Michael Rahm","Hey, Chris, I\u2019m going to add to that and just along that line of questioning not only we doing, looking at the debottlenecking and pursuing that, but we\u2019re also in the same way going after sulfur alternative, ensuring that we have good optionality and where we can get our sulfur.","With that, we\u2019re making an investment in a sulfur melter in Florida, which is going to give us the flexibility to bring in [apparel] sulfur from other markets, Middle East and so on, other low cost markets and not just be reliant on molten sulfur coming in as well we\u2019re investing in a couple of cross-Gulf barges that\u2019s going to give us the availability or ability to move ammonia across from the Louisiana into our Florida operations.","So the point is we\u2019re looking for all the flexibility we can find to ensure we have low cost raw material inputs and I think both the ammonia de-bottlenecking and the sulfur melter are really going to position us for an advantage cost position on those two important raw materials.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. And good morning everyone, I\u2019m wondering if you can speak a little bit about general and maybe post to CF acquisition, I thought it was notable that you sort of cutting or reducing your phosphate production in response for the higher input cost? And I don\u2019t remember you being that aggressive in the past. So, if you could just kind of update us on your thought process and sort of the strategy going forward, and is this new or is there more to come or how should we be thinking about it?","","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Vincent. Glad to address that. On the strategy, the CF acquisition which we called project donuts and so was the whole in our donut we have mines and facilities all around that the CF phosphate facilities. That was just -- we are a natural parent and it worked well in term synergies. We\u2019re anticipating synergy harvesting of about $50 million in 2015 and we\u2019re well on track to that. It\u2019s really been -- all we could have hope for plus more in terms of the cost efficiencies and probably more importantly the quality of talent we\u2019re able to acquire with that assets.","It\u2019s really gone well. The integrations gone well and it really work for us. We\u2019re able to get the cost synergies, we\u2019re able to rebalance productions amongst various plans and facilities and it\u2019s given us additional years of mining capacity and flexibility with in terms of differing a mine going forward.","We really believe in the phosphates segment. We are always looking to grow our top line as we have with the CF acquisition and we think there is over time, there\u2019s going to be more opportunities to grow the top line in the phosphate business. The Ma'aden project is another important element of that where we\u2019re investing 25% of the cost of the Ma'aden project for 25% of the off take of the project in Saudi Arabia positioned us well to serve the India and Asian markets, Southeast Asia markets. So, we\u2019re continuing to be strong believers in phosphate and look to grow the top lines on that.","Next question you asked was about curtailment and what we\u2019re thinking there. This is \u2013 we\u2019re not straying from our strategy of producing to market demand. What we\u2019ve seen is a delay in market demand for this fall season principally in North America. Delay in decisions and we could [recall] and could perhaps speak to that in a moment.","But we\u2019ve seen the delay in decision making to apply phosphates. We think it\u2019s going to come. The phosphates would be bought. But for us to build inventories with high cost, sulfur and high cost ammonia not without commitments for those tonnes, we just didn\u2019t see that as a prudent financial move. So we\u2019ve throttle back our phosphate \u2013 finished phosphate production, so as not to build the high cost inventories, quite a simple as that nothing unnatural there.","And perhaps I\u2019ll just move into Rick \u2013 Rich McLellan, our leader of a Commercial operations and just talk about what we see happening on phosphate demand.","","Richard McLellan","Yes. Thanks Jim. And we \u2013 I think what\u2019s going \u2013 what we see going on in the field. There\u2019s a lot of talk about demand destruction everything else happening in the marketplace. We had a very delayed harvest and the farmers have been slow to come in and make their minds up on what they\u2019re going to buy. That started to occur as we\u2019ve got a good chunk of the soybeans in the bean and what\u2019s happening is farmers are slow to come in, but when they make the decision they\u2019re not cutting application rates. We\u2019re seeing the same thing and planning in Brazil where the planting is delayed, yet farmers aren\u2019t cutting back anyway on the amount of phosphates they use.","So that\u2019s what we see happening at the farm gate level. The other piece I think I\u2019d add Jim to our strategy is we\u2019ve continued to focus on building out our premium products, so that in phosphates in those key and growing markets in Brazil and North America in the Caribbean Basin, we\u2019ve been able to supply a bigger percentage of our business as MicroEssentials and less is DAP.","","Richard Mack","And Vincent, this is a Rich Mack, one final point that I would make. I think it\u2019s fair to say that we believe that our phosphate story is getting increasingly more compelling and we made a lot of investments Ma'aden, CF, ADM distribution business are in line with that. We are taking a lot cost out of the system and making good progress there. We\u2019re capturing synergies from the CFDL.","And so we think telling the story and providing more transparency to our segment is important and that\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re going to move forward with this new segment on international distribution and that will provide much more direct line of sight into our phosphate business.","","Jim Prokopanko","Vincent, you\u2019re not going to get a medal for being the first one to ask a question, but you get the prize for having the longest answer to your question. We\u2019ll carry on.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financials. Your line is open.","","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financials","Question on potash, actually two questions, one is just do you see demand slowing at all in North America in the fourth quarter and I\u2019m just wondering how much of this demand we\u2019re seeing is really rebuilding pipeline inventories versus pounds in the ground.","And then as granular has been very tight this year, standard not so tight, as we get into next year and if [indiscernible] advance going up and there\u2019s 900,000 tonnes more granular out there, what impact do you see that having on the North American marketplace?","","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Don, good to hear from you. I\u2019m going turn that over Rick McLellan, Leader of Commercial Group to answer those questions for you.","","Richard McLellan","Yes, good morning, Don. As far as demand slowing in North America, I think we came through spring season. And Larry and I talked about it on the last call that we traveled and we could not find potash in the month of July in anywhere that we visited in Illinois or Indiana. And so, I think what\u2019s getting moved into place right now is going to the field or will go to the field in the next six weeks.","So, we don\u2019t see demand waning in North America, nor do we see that happening in South America. And the second part of your question was the impact of [Vanscoy] production coming on is a big project. They take a long while to bring on. So I don\u2019t know whether that happens next year or not. The only thing that I\u2019ll tell you is that we\u2019re planning with all of our major customers and there is strong demand for granular both in North America and around the world. And little extra production is not going to impact very much would be a situation that we see the strong position we see for granular markets.","","Jim Prokopanko","Anything you want to add to that Mike.","","Michael Rahm","I can get some specifics in terms of what we\u2019re assuming for demand for corn acreage. We think corn acreage will be off a bit in that 88 million to 90 million acre range and soybeans probably in the 80 million to 82 million and [oil wheat] in the 50 to 53. We don\u2019t expect much of a decline in application rates. And as a consequence you put all that together. We think both phosphate and potash overall use could be down 3% to 5% in the North America in the 2014, 2015 year and that\u2019s certainly pegged into our global shipment forecast.","","Jim Prokopanko","Just to put a point on it, Don, on to your questions. The pipeline stock, this is lowest we\u2019ve seen in the number of years and that is low because in spite of the high production rates, so the demand has been good and its going to take us some considerable effort and good operating rates to continue to keep up with the demand and as well as fill a very, very thin pipeline. And then your question on [Vanscoy] that\u2019s going to come up, I think they say in 2015 and we expect that to be replacing current imports into North America. So we\u2019re \u2013 yes, there is some modest concern about where those tonnes are going, but I think that will as I said, displaces imports that we\u2019re now seeing reach North America.","","Michael Rahm","Jim, I might add just in terms of the demand outlook we just talked about our global shipment numbers. In terms of the composition of that, I think the theme for 2015 is that the torrid pace that we seen in the Americas slows down a bit, but as we expect Asia is going to pick up, particularly India, we think the pipeline there is absolutely bone dry and Rich, you just got back from Malaysia, Indonesia, Burma, the demand prospects for [PMK] those markets remain robust. So we think India -- we think Asia is going to step up and offset some of the slowdown that we\u2019re projecting for the Americas.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Jeff Zekauskas from JP Morgan. Your line is open.","","Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan","Thanks very much. At the beginning of the call you were talking about your liquidity buffer. Did you say that you have $1 billion about your buffer? You bought back 3.5 million shares. And is it the case that you could spend, I don\u2019t know 1 billion on share repurchase in the coming year or two?","","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Jeff Zekauskas, glad to have you on the call and we\u2019re going to have Rich Mack speak to the liquidity buffer and perhaps just give you some color on the repurchasing.","","Richard Mack","Hey, Jeff, it\u2019s Rich. I think the answer to your question is yes. You\u2019re correct, as of today anyways we currently have roughly $1 billion in excess cash after you take into account the upward adjustment in our liquidity buffer. And what we do in fact going forward really would go back to our capital management philosophy and I would just refer you to some of our prior commentary about our priorities for investment which include maintaining our credit ratings and of our course our dividend policy, sustaining our assets, looking at organic growth opportunities, things like MicroEssentials and cogeneration, K3 for example.","Strategic growth opportunities, we talked ADM, CF and Ma'aden. And to the extent that we have excess cash, you should expect that we will continue to move towards the balance sheet metrics that we have publicly provided. We had stated leverage ratio and of course our liquidity buffer. So, the way I look at it is in 2014 we have been extraordinarily active if you include share repurchases and you include dividends, we\u2019ve returned $3 billion to shareholders, which is I think by far the most that you would find in our sector.","And most recently after we got through the MAC Trust purchase agreement we\u2019ve been involved in open market share repurchases. And so, I think I would leave you with the fact that we\u2019ll balanced and we\u2019ll methodical in our approach and we will be a strong generator of cash going forward and to the extent that we have excess cash we will look to return that to shareholders in the form of either dividends or share repurchases.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Paul Massoud from Stifel. Your line is open.","","Paul Massoud - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, given low producer inventory now and logistic constraints that we\u2019ve seen in getting product distributed across the U.S. I was just wondering, as you look out over the horizon, did you think or have you seen any evidence that retailers may start to revert back pre-2008 practices by holding more inventory or do you expect that the inventory rebuild if and when it comes it\u2019s going to come at the producer level? Thanks.","","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Paul. You ask a good question. Principally around a long and complex supply ","chain of - its one thing making it, and it\u2019s one thing delivering it to the farmer at the dealer level. I\u2019d say you gotten to be a whole lot more complex and uncertain about getting it between the producer and that dealer. And we are spending considerable effort and time internally looking at how we can avoid the hassle we faced last year with railway shipping product, railway shipping issues and what is becoming a growing challenge on the barge system.","So there is a lot of uncertainties still remaining about our capacity this year to recover from the hole that was dug last year and not being able to get product to either domestic or international customers on a timely basis, particularly when I speak international customers I\u2019m referring to potash shipments out of Western Canada. It\u2019s a challenge we put to our dealer customers that we just can\u2019t FedEx this product a week in advance of when they need to sell it to the supplier. We\u2019ve got to take up over a month to six weeks to position or train, get it shipped and get it delivered. So you put your finger on a real emerging and developing issues what position the dealers take in storing product and this is \u2013 here is a good example of farmers delaying decision making, so dealers are reluctant to make the decision of loading up their warehouses if they don\u2019t know the farmers are taking. So this is backing up the system and what we\u2019re doing is where we can position products further in country closer to those dealers, with dealers and be ready for potential problems in the delivery. I\u2019m going to ask Rick and Collin to add some color to what he\u2019s seeing in the distribution system.","Richard Mack","","Thanks, Jim. I\u2019ll just take where you were at with the farmers delaying decisions. And the dealers have been good at stepping up and placing the inventory, but they really are looking for the farmer to do something. And so, when the farmer puts the brakes on or delays making decisions during the harvest period like this, dealers are really reticent to take on inventory to hold it for those customers.","So, I think that what we\u2019re going to see is that farmers can see the logistics problems aren\u2019t going to go away, then you will see a change in dealer mentality. And I think that\u2019s the part that we have to look at going forward. And it involves the whole chain you can\u2019t the dealer is not going to step in just like we talked about not building phosphate inventories with high priced raw materials and so the key piece is getting a much better seamless move from production through to the farmer.","Jim Prokopanko","","Rick, just add some of the \u2013 some ideas on what we\u2019ve been doing and whether it\u2019s positioning barges, unit trains ex-base contracts and how we\u2019ve been trying to work around this?","Richard Mack","Yes, it\u2019s a good point Jim. What we\u2019ve in North America attempted to do is as Jim says we\u2019ve moved it closer, moved the inventory closer to the customer. And but we\u2019ve what we have done is we focused on getting the inventory in place that\u2019s going to be used for the fall. And in the past we would fill up inventory no matter whether it was going to be used for the fall or not. And so, we put [prior] dates on what if we place inventory in new warehouses on when they should get invoiced. And so it\u2019s helped us put some discipline around it and in that way we don\u2019t have the inventory misplaced somewhere in North America when it could be used to go to India. So, Jim those are the things that we are doing in on potash, we\u2019re moving product up where we\u2019ve got the ability to into the dealers warehouse, but right now it\u2019s we\u2019re producing it and we\u2019re moving it and it\u2019s going to the ground.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken - Cleveland Research","","Yes good morning, thanks for the question. Just wanted to dig a little bit deeper into your thoughts regarding kind of the timing of maybe the next China in India contracts and what your expectations would be for Chinese potash imports in both 2014 and 15 and then the same for India in terms of imports as opposed to just consumption? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","","Good to hear from you Michael, and a good question. Yes, China contract is right before us but all I can say on it is that one, China has been using good amounts of Potash this past year. Demand has been strong and we\u2019ve also seen those inventories as a result of that diminish. So we expect there to be a good appetite into China. Timing wise we are very hopeful that we are going to see a contract, a normal type of contract over the next by the end of the calendar year, fingers crossed, discussions are underway and in terms of pricing it\u2019s going to be above where our last contract was which is a low bar, but we expect a higher price and I\u2019m not going to say much more about the negotiations at this point.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Mark [Gulley] from BGB Financial. Your line is open","Unidentified Analyst ","Good morning. Had a discussion about inventory at the producer level although you as an organization, as an industry kind of backed off on reporting that and a lot of talk about channel inventory, but no discussion about soil inventory, mostly P&K has the industry or perhaps Mosaic ever attempted to take a look at what might be the available levels of P&K available for the next crop that\u2019s already stored in the soil let\u2019s say for example in North America.","Jim Prokopanko","Insightful question, Mark and something that we watch carefully. I\u2019m going to have Mike Rahm to speak to that.","Michael Rahm","","Well I guess the best, hard evidence is what the research at IP&I has done over the years where they have done a very careful accounting of what crops have removed from the soil and what nutrients have been applied to the soil both in the form of chemical fertilizers as well as manure and so forth. And those have shown consistently that nutrient removal has exceeded what has been applied for several years and there are many parts of the world where or many parts of the country where P&K soil tests are relatively low.","I think what we said earlier about record crops removing record amounts of nutrients is really relevant. Farmers have adopted the use of precision technology, the old view that you just kind of [indiscernible] the P&K and build up soil levels and keep applying at certain constant rates. I think that\u2019s changed a bit with the precision technology that\u2019s been available.","So as we said earlier this whole notion that the P&K levels in the soil are adequate to feed a 215 crop just doesn\u2019t seem to square with all the facts.","Jim Prokopanko","Yes, I\u2019m going to add to that Mark that when you look at the state of technology on the farm today, there isn\u2019t a lot of room for one tank you put in high test, the next tank you put in low test and we are talking about this for example seed. If you put in some of the high value multi trade seeds farmers are going to be spending $420, $410 a bag a seed, if you apply that to 2.5 acres that\u2019s a $150 to $160 per acre per seed and this is the point I made in my opening comments.","When you put on a $160 of seed value you are not, not going to feed it. You are going to give it the best bite you can so you get the maximum value of it. And with these record crops what you have seen just as Mike said, we have extracted record crop nutrients. So, yes there may be just a little bit of dip and little economizing farmers might have to do that, but there just isn\u2019t the room to tighten the belt like there used to be. These are highly technical businesses that farmers have to maximize economic yield and that\u2019s using the best seed and the best nutrition for those excellent seeds.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","","Yes thanks, good morning everyone. A question on the cost saving kind of target the -- out of the 500 million by 2018. And I think in the press release you alluded to starting to realize those benefits in the quarter, maybe quantify that, quantify maybe what you are expecting in 4Q where looking for pretty sharp improvement in potash unit cost? And then as we think about \u201915 and beyond what the capital cost of actually achieving some of those targets might actually look like? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Hey good morning, Adam. I\u2019m going to turn that right over to Rich Mack our CFO who\u2019s pursuing this initiative.","Richard Mack","","Hi, Adam. What I would say is first of all we\u2019re off to a very good start I think in terms of trying to achieve these cost saving initiatives and I\u2019ll remind you that a portion of these are real or absolute cost reductions and a portion of these are intended to offset future inflationary pressures in our businesses. And I think what I would also say is from a management perspective we are working very hard to front end load as many of these costs as we possibly can. So things like shutting down our Carlsbad MLP production by the end of the year.","The portfolio optimization actions that we have taken, so the sale of Hersey, the signing of a purchase agreement to divest our Argentinean operations, shutting down our Chilean operations we\u2019ve gone through a very significant corporate function, cost review and we are implementing the actions to take significant costs out of our SG&A. And so it\u2019s resulting really across the board and in headcount reductions that would be included at our corporate offices, in our business units and in our international locations. We\u2019ve set up a shared services center as another example down in Florida to look at places where it is more friendly from a cost perspective to do business.","And another example I throw out as we recently shut down our [Hooker\u2019s] prairie mine in Florida. And so in the end what we are trying to do is we\u2019re being systematic, we are looking for things like attrition, early retirements, less use of contractors and so bottom line off to a very good start. When we get to a few years out in terms of capital, I think that you are going to see that there should be a step function change in terms of what our capital requirements would be, again, it\u2019s all dependant on what sort of opportunities we see in terms of organic growth and strategic growth opportunities but you -- we should see some of the cost savings that we are achieving results in 2015, 2016 or probably thereafter I mean these targets remember are 2018 targets and less capital being used by the organization.","Jim Prokopanko","Yes with that Adam, I\u2019ll just say net, we are very pleased with how the organization has responded to the cost savings initiatives. We are ahead of plan and we are pushing to have most of these savings harvested before the five year time horizon. We\u2019ve got time for one more question folks, and then we\u2019ll wrap it up.","Operator","","Your last question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask actually about the Indian potash and phosphate market and the subsidy expectations you\u2019ve built into your demand forecast for next year. Do you expect the subsidy to rise along with the prices like in particularly with the potash market and if it doesn\u2019t how will that impact demand and will prices have to adjust to accommodate dealer margins, just wondering your thoughts? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Okay, Andrew good morning and welcome. I\u2019m going to turn it over after just the opening comment here to Rick and to Mike Rahm. It\u2019s something we are watching carefully with the change in leadership in India we are seeing the \u2013 we are starting to see the signs of real reform and we are hopeful and pragmatically hopeful that we are going to see true reform to the subsidy program. The new leadership there is some small things that have already been signaled, we\u2019ve gotten distribution rights for potash and into India something that we\u2019ve been trying to achieve for a couple of years, new leadership in India and quickly we saw that request met. So that\u2019s giving us a real hope that we are going to see changes to the entire agricultural system and specifically nutrient reform. Rick, do you want to add some color on that?","Richard Mack","","Yes just add a couple of things. There is \u2013 I visited with some of the industry people from India in Singapore on Monday evening at a [Capitex] event and they talked about finally being in a position that the government is going to focus on real change. And what that means is trying to get to the balance crop nutrition that they have set off, that they need to get to. And people are very, very positive that\u2019s going to happen. I think probably what\u2019 s more so then what\u2019s going on with prices of P&K they are going to have to deal with the difference between nitrogen pricing and P&K pricing. And so what that change looks like I think we have to be patient for it to take place but if you used 2014 as a guide we saw it growth in both P&K imports and applications and a change to the nitrogen subsidy would only support that continuing.","Michael Rahm","And Rick, I\u2019d just add a couple of points. As I said earlier, we are banking on India for picking up the pace in terms of their P&K imports. We think phosphate imports will be up to around 5.5 million tonnes of DAP in calendar year 2015 and MLP imports probably in that 4.5 million tonne range. The one thing I would add farm economics in India are great. Their minimum support prices are at relatively high levels, more moderate international prices are more stable, rupee has really caused import economics to work. So in terms of our demand forecast we don\u2019t see changes, any changes in subsidy policy jeopardizing the demand outlook in India. The other thing I would add is that with the crop and petroleum prices, it takes a lot of pressure off the government in terms of its overall subsidy bill because petroleum takes up a pretty big chunk of that. So I think there will be a little bit less pressure to squeeze the balloon a little bit harder on the P&K side.","Jim Prokopanko","Okay and with that I\u2019d like reinforce our key messages and thank you all for the questions and the interest on this call. First, we believe the current negative sentiment in agriculture markets is overblown and the low valuations present compelling opportunities for Mosaic and investors alike. Second, we always have to keep in mind that this is a cyclical business. Agricultural commodity prices are indeed lower. This cycle will play out and prices will certainly rise again. Third and most important Mosaic is in an excellent condition to thrive across the cycle. We have the resources, the assets and talent to whether the current economic environment sees opportunities as they arise and outperform when conditions improve. Thank you all for joining the call. I hope you all have a great and safe day. Good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14784":["The Mosaic Co.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our first quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results.","Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our first quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibit to yesterday's Form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone. Since you've all had ample time to review our results, I will keep my prepared remarks brief and at a high level so that we can get straight to your questions. Mosaic continued to execute well in the first quarter of 2018 and global markets for our products continued to improve.","Our financial performance for the quarter was impacted by weather and the underperformance of Canadian rail service providers. In both potash and phosphate, we came in at the low end of our sales volume guidance due to the late North American spring and the rail-related logistical issues. Including related production curtailment costs, these factors negatively impact the quarter by $0.07 to $0.10 per share.","For the quarter, several notable items resulted in earnings per share of $0.11. On an adjusted basis, Mosaic earned $0.20 per share on net sales of $1.9 billion, both up materially from the first quarter of 2017. We expect to recover most of the deferred sales volumes as the rail issues are resolved and global seasonal demand moves into full swing.","We have three key takeaways for this call. First, we expect strong business performance to continue throughout 2018 and beyond. In spite of an increase in our anticipated effective tax rate from 20% to approximately 30%, we have increased the midpoint of our full-year earnings per share guidance to reflect strong EBITDA growth, our confidence in the business environment and our ability to execute.","Second, the underlying performance of our three business units is continuing to reflect significant operational improvements. And third, we are making remarkable progress in transforming the Mosaic Fertilizantes business in Brazil and we're excited about the success our team has delivered in our first quarter of ownership.","Now, I'll start with the markets, which continued their steady improvement. While the late spring and much of North America has delayed planting and led to some doubts about the 2018 crop, farmers outside of the U.S. are generally enjoying good economic results. Brazil was a highlight, grower economics are excellent with stable commodity prices and a weakening reais. Potash and phosphate prices built on their momentum during the quarter. Strong on-farm demand and delayed purchasing in India, Brazil and other key growing regions is expected to provide extended price support.","It is important to keep in mind that prices usually move seasonally and cyclically. However, we expect no seasonal declines until much later in the year and we expect the cyclical trend to be positive throughout 2018.","In potash, prices have continued a steady ascent. For the quarter, our average sale price was $239 per tonne, which is up $45 per tonne from the mid-2016 lows. Global demand is strong. In fact, Canpotex is fully committed through June in spite of the lack of a contract with China. New supply continues to be delayed beyond prior expectations. And now, we believe prices will remain firm into the second half of 2018.","Phosphate prices and margins also increased during the quarter, once again belying the theory that supply coming to market in 2017 and 2018 would pressure margins. In fact, average first quarter stripping margins have increased year-over-year from $233 to $262 per tonne. Our actions to remove higher cost production have helped lead to a balanced supply\/demand picture. Overall, market conditions are constructive as we expect demand in India and Latin America to increase.","Now, I'll move on to a brief discussion of each of our segments. First, the transformation of Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil is well underway and proceeding according to plan. As a reminder, we expect to achieve $100 million in synergies in 2018 and $275 million in annual savings by 2020. We are on pace to achieve those numbers with many efficiency-generating initiatives implemented, in process or in the queue.","We've already taken actions that will ultimately deliver $100 million in annual savings. It's important to note, however, that these savings will primarily flow through cost of goods sold and thus be recognized in later periods as inventory is sold. In 2018, we would expect roughly a third of the targeted savings to benefit earnings in the first half of the year and two-thirds in the second half.","Our second quarter gross margin guidance for the Brazil business considers several competing factors. On the negative side, we expect to take turnarounds during the second quarter, which will increase our production costs. We will see diminishing benefits of purchase accounting adjustments declining from around $30 million in the first quarter to approximately $20 million and we expect a seasonal shift to more sales of lower margin single superphosphate.","On the plus side, as I said, our business transformation is taking hold, which is leading to real efficiencies. Market prices and stripping margins have increased for MAP and the currency exchange has grown more favorable with the weakening Brazilian reais.","We've also modified our annual volume guidance for this segment because we missed some intra-segment eliminations. The change in guidance does not reflect any change in our expectations for the market or for our business. We are making excellent progress and we continue to have very positive expectations for the acquisition in Brazil. The region remains extremely promising for the agricultural industry. In fact, Brazil soybean production provides Mosaic with a good hedge against any ongoing Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybean and helps demonstrate the value of our strategy to build on America's powerhouse.","Our growing momentum in Brazil is the primary driver of our new higher full-year tax rate guidance. Put simply, we expect a higher proportion of our pre-tax earnings to come from Brazil than our previous guidance showed. In phosphates, the aggressive transformation of the business is driving material cost reductions without sacrificing our operational excellence or employee safety.","In fact, in the first quarter, we achieved several new daily production records at both our mines and our chemical plants as we strived to recover a portion of the lost production from idling our higher cost Plant City facility. Cash cost per tonne in Florida mined rock were $35 in the quarter, the lowest in several years.","Our sales volume came in near the low end of guidance range as a result of weather and logistics challenges. Our guidance for the second quarter reflects the expectation of continued high stripping margin and strong seasonal shipment volumes.","Finally, in the potash business, our costs and overall operating performance remain very strong. Shipment volumes were challenged by the significant rail backlog and, in fact, we were at or near containment at all of our mines for part of the quarter, which negatively impact production by approximately 200,000 tonnes.","To reiterate, demand exists for all that product and we do not believe that we have lost significant sales for 2018. It is just an issue of timing. Production costs per tonne were roughly flat with the sequential quarter despite the logistics-driven curtailments. Gross margins per tonne were above guidance as prices remained strong and our business mix was more heavily weighted towards higher priced granular product.","I should note that our results this quarter reflect the one-time impact of a change in the methodology Canpotex uses to recognize revenue. Under the previous rev rec standards, we would have recognized an additional 400,000 tonnes of sales in the first quarter. Our second quarter guidance reflects the expectation that more lower price standard product will be shipped in the quarter. Risks to our volume guidance include a longer delayed contract with the Chinese customers and persistent problems with rail transport in Canada.","Before I conclude, I would like to provide some insight into our capital philosophy. In essence, our approach to capital allocation has not changed. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and maintain our assets and then we use additional capital to grow the business and generate shareholder return. The past few years were quite challenging, but we were able to weather the storm while maintaining a strong financial foundation and completing the largest acquisition of our history.","Today with strong and improving market conditions and a considerably more efficient operating model, we expect to generate substantial cash and we expect to use that cash just as prudently as our track record indicates we always have.","We expect to be able to pay down debt so that we can return to our over time leverage ratio targets. In fact, we are now targeting to pay down $500 million of debt this year, up from our prior estimate and well ahead of the pace to reach our commitment to pay down $700 million of debt by the end of 2020.","To conclude, this was another good quarter for Mosaic even as we experienced some external challenges. We are on the right course managing for cost efficiency across the cycle while maintaining the ability to capitalize on opportunities that improving markets present and remaining constantly vigilant to growth opportunities, large and small. We are looking forward to a strong 2018 and beyond.","Now we will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Neil (12:07) calling in for Vincent. Just a question on your outlook for Chinese phosphate exports. It seems that DAP, MAP exports been down so far pretty significantly to begin 2018. What's your outlook for the rest of the year and what are you forecasting in terms of Chinese capacity shutdowns?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Neil (12:25). This is Joc here. I will make a couple comments and pass this on to Corrine and Mike. But let me reiterate our previous position, which was that our forecasts do not have a decrease in China exports per se, although our bias is that we expect that those may go down, and certainly over time we expect they'll go down. You make a note and I will reiterate that the last six months, these exports are down by 24%. But in terms of the first quarter, what I will caution people on, it is a very small quarter compared to the rest of the year. The big quarters are the second and the third quarters. So, we will wait before we make any determination.","And really the big factor there is price. If the price is higher, they will be motivated to export more. If the price is lower, they would be probably exporting less. Corrine, Mike?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joc. Yeah, Neil (13:28), we are seeing \u2013 the environmental protection of the Yangtze River Zone mandate has been widely discussed and we really are seeing events progressing. There's continued environmental squeeze on all the producers. We're seeing some rock production at some mines decreasing and there's increased cost for gypsum disposal as well as these regulations on proximity relative to the river may be causing some plants to require relocation in the future. But as Joc noted, we are seeing stronger margins and economics today.","So, the decrease that we've seen, the 24% drop in the last six months, that's about 1.2 million tonnes. So, again, highlight that it's a relatively small quarters in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the first quarter of 2018. But we really do anticipate that the pace of restructuring will continue in the Chinese industry as we go forward for the longer term.","Mike, do you have anything to add?","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Not a whole lot to add, but if the Chinese keep up this pace of about 1 million to 1.2 million tonne less exports, it basically is about \u2013 our number show about 1 million to 1.5 million tonne hole in the global S&D that needs to be filled from somewhere else. So it just reiterates Joc's point that we haven't factored in a dramatic decline in Chinese exports in order to balance the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I mean, the phosphate markets and prices have been pretty healthy to start the year and some of that is because the Chinese exports lower and it definitely has been stronger than expected. So, can you just share your outlook on phosphate pricing and stripping margins for the back half of the year? And you mentioned that seasonally we might be a little bit weak, but probably a little bit better than has been in the past. And what's implied in your guidance for phosphate pricing and stripping margins? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay, Andrew, thanks. Thanks for the question. I will push this pretty quick to Corrine and Mike again, but I will say, yes, the phosphate markets have been strong. I think our actions have been part of that. By shutting down higher-cost production here in the U.S., we've ensured a well-balanced market. And what we've seen as a result we believe is a market strip margin that has industry benchmark, strip margin that has really moved up in the last couple months. And we have not seen what we would have normally seen, which is a winter decline, and so we don't see a real decline till very late in the year, if at all. Corrine?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. I would just reiterate the global demand growth is very strong. It was strong last year. It's very strong this year. We're forecasting about 1.8% further growth really led by demand in India, Brazil, Asia, Oceania and Africa really strong growth numbers.","We've also seen supply adjustments that Joc talked about with the Plant City idling, but also we've had much slower ramp-ups than expected out of Saudi Arabia and out of Morocco, and that combined with these lower Chinese exports are creating a pretty tight S&D. And so we've seen stripping margins at a healthy level for Q1 and we actually are guiding to a little bit higher industry stripping margins in the balance of the year.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. We do calculate a benchmark stripping margin based on published spot prices. And from January 2016 to the end of last year, that margin traded in a pretty narrow channel, in that $225 to $250 range. And what we said I think on last call is that we think fundamentals have changed, as Corrine pointed out, to move that up into kind of that $275 to $300 channel. And indeed, if you look at the stripping margin I think last week was approaching $290. So we have moved up basis these fundamentals.","And as we look out for the rest of the year, we're seeing good price momentum in key markets, whether it's Brazil or India. And the outlook for raw material costs with some additional ammonia coming online and sulfur market coming to better balance I think bodes well for margins in the last half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Go ahead, please. Your line is open. And P.J. Juvekar, if your line is on mute, please unmute. Looks like your next question is going to be from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. I just want to go back to the outlook for exportable phosphate supply in the second half of the year. Then the Moroccan \u2013 maybe, Mike, you can comment on how you see the new Moroccan capacity ramping up. Obviously, you have a good window into what's going on with MOD (18:44) and what impacted the shipping difficulties in \u2013 the Mediterranean have on first quarter pricing?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Don. I'm going to hand that straight to Mike because those I think are straight in his wheelhouse.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Don. I think the best way to answer that is just looking at demand growth, some of the supply adjustments and what is the overall supply and demand balance that we see. We're projecting that demand for the main phosphate products grows about 1.2 million tonnes. And if you look at some of the supply changes, we've taken about 1.5 million tonnes offline with the Plant City idling. And when you look at the ramp-ups of capacity, the Jorf Phosphate Hub will produce a few more tonnes \u2013 hub number three will produce a few more tonnes this year.","The fourth hub, the startup of that has been delayed probably until the second half of the year. But you probably can squeeze maybe 900,000 tonnes or 1 million tonnes out of there. And then the MPC ramp up, I think we've indicated last time that in 2017 it produced about 477,000 tonnes. We think it will produce 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes this year, so there's an incremental tonnage there.","And then if the Chinese continue along this pace where exports are off 1 million tonnes, that basically results in about 1.5 million-tonne supply gap for 2018. And that's why going back to the previous question, we're not predicting that the world runs out of phosphate. But what we are predicting is that the supply and demand balance is such that you're going to have to see somewhat elevated prices and margins maybe to crimp a little bit of the demand growth, but also stimulate a little bit more supply coming from established producers, whether it's in the U.S. or other places.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. What percentage of your ammonia requirement from CF will you purchase in the first half or what's the cadence of those purchases through the year?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Jeff. I'm going to hand that straight to Corrine, but I can say in broad terms that with our own production of circa 400,000 tonnes in Louisiana and our off-take of 600,000 tonnes, which is paced basically even throughout the year, so our off-take at the low end and today we'd be taking the low end from CF, that'll be paced evenly throughout the year. So, our own capacity will be somewhere around 1 million tonnes to a little bit higher than that short tonnes per year. The remainder, which is somewhere around 0.5 million tonnes, we will purchase. That's for Florida, not including Brazil, but the other 0.5 million tonnes, we'll purchase on the open market. So, approximately two-thirds of our total tonnage will come from either the CF or our own production. Corrine, did you...?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. I don't have much to add to that, Joc. It will be relatively even paced throughout the year. We've got our own dedicated logistics shipping and that requires a steady take pattern.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thank you. I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the outlook and what's changed and took the EPS range for the year up $0.15 at midpoint. Obviously, the tax rate went up within that on higher Brazil earnings, but just can you calibrate a little bit how the outlook for potash and phosphate and nitrogen changes the order of magnitude between the three businesses? I think there was an allusion to a belief that potash prices would be stronger in the second half than prior and just a little bit more color around the outlook would be helpful. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Look, what we're probably seeing today in terms of our EPS outlook going up is as we get more into the year, we're seeing stronger potash and phosphate fundamentals. In potash, we're seeing a good demand picture, low global inventories, which I could throw at Mike for a second, but also expectations that what we're not seeing in the market is a lot of the new production yet. And so, as we get further along in the year, we have more confidence that that will be later on to come. And it's virtually the same for phosphates where we see great demand around the world and slower to come on new production. So, what we don't expect to see is any kind of post-season weakness that we might have, had there been more new production coming in. So, really, that's what's driving it.","And then, of course, as we've now got three to five months in Brazil versus one month at our last earnings call, we now have a much greater faith in achieving our $100 million of synergies plus the tailwinds of both better pricing and better Brazilian reais. And I might throw that to Tony in terms of the reais impact.","Anthony T. Brausen - The Mosaic Co.","And I'll add just also we are continuing to have the progress from a production standpoint, from an operational efficiency standpoint. We also have the offsets, however, from Q1 and carrying into Q2 the logistics issues, principally the rail issues in Canada. And, of course, you mentioned \u2013 Adam, you mentioned a higher tax rate, which also is impacting us to the downside. But we want to note that from a cash tax standpoint, we're not expecting to pay cash taxes this year. So, from a cash flow perspective, that higher tax rate will not impact us.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","So, Adam, to summarize, really, it's more confidence in the future of this year and going into the second half of this year than we were able to have at the start of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. I was wondering if you could give an update on how the spring season is going in the U.S. and in particular, we had obviously a delayed start, but what you're seeing in terms of application rates and any read you might have on the need for distributors or retailers to have to restock during the spring or do you think they already have sufficient inventories. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Michael. I'm going to push that over to Mike to answer the question. But one thing I will say is just recognize that in today's world, the ability to apply fertilizer and plant very rapidly has increased quite a bit even over the last, say, decade. So we think that the ability to catch up is a lot better than it ever was before. Mike, do you want to talk a bit about the spring season?","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Hey. Good morning, Michael. Yeah, we got off to a slow start, but we're rapidly catching up. You probably saw the planting progress numbers from yesterday. The corn planting as of Sunday was 39% complete, soybean planting about 15% complete. The corn planting is still running a little bit behind the five-year average, but if you look at some key states like Illinois, Indiana, they are running well ahead of the five-year average. And in the case of soybeans, we're off to actually a faster start than normal in terms of planting. So, as Joc said, farmers can sink seeds into the soil pretty quickly with the current technology.","The other point is, all of the feedback that we're getting from our account managers is very positive in terms of farmers applying rates at normal or even above normal rates. And as we've been saying for a long time, the demand drivers continue to look very strong. The world's and North America's harvested big crops. There's a need to replenish those nutrients. And secondly, when you look at the affordability index, P&K continue to be good buys for farmers and we think that they are actually rebuilding some rates and with higher yield objectives, in some cases, increasing rates. So the season is really shifting into high gear as we move a little bit further north and the weather cooperates. So I think it's going to be a great spring season.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. Thank you. A couple transportation logistic questions. What's your outlook for the resolution in the rail issues of the Canadian rail lines in the near term? With respect to the comment about Canpotex being sold out through June, is that effectively a rail fleet limitation or port handling limitation? What limits that? And is that something that can be addressed? And then, lastly, transportation issues in Brazil are meaningful. And is that really just a productivity drag for your business down there or does having a distribution business down there represent a value proposition to you?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Steve, we're going to take these one at a time. And what I'll do is I'll come back to Brazil in a second after we get Corrine to talk about our outlook for the Canadian railways and what's going on there. But let me just say, look, the weather-related issues that the Canadian railways faced were definitely seasonal and delays because of cold weather and snow. Those we fully expect to recover from. The one that is probably a little more unpredictable is what is the potential for a strike with the Canadian Pacific Rail, and that we really don't have a reasonable place to start in terms of a view.","Corrine, do you just want to talk about how we're shifting those volumes and when we expect to see those volumes come back?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. As Mike noted, spring season is making up the pace pretty nicely at this point in the quarter. We do have some weather and rail-related tonnage amounts that flipped from first quarter we think into the balance of the year. But our guidance for the year, as Joc said, is unchanged. We think we'll get that volume back.","Canpotex is sold through June. That's a combination of limitations, both the ability for producers to supply those tonnes given the big North American spring season that's going on as well as some rail import logistics. Over the long term, it absolutely \u2013 we are working on ways to improve that capacity. So there is more capacity for exports in the future. And I guess, Brazil, you want to turn that over, Joc, to...","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Let me just turn to Brazil now and, obviously, our distribution business and the proximity of our new production business to the markets, the key agricultural markets, we think is one of the key competitive advantages that we accomplish through this. And then the improvements in our internal logistics in Brazil are the other area where we can add real value through this acquisition.","Rick, do you want to just talk a little bit about that?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Steve. In Brazil, we're seeing some real advantages from all the moves that we make with product. And when we look in Brazil, about 78% of what we move is by truck. And so when we look across our whole business, we've been able to develop synergies \u2013 significant synergies, roughly at least $5 million of movements by truck that we're taking advantage of back-hauls with trucks moving to ports, trucks bringing material that we produce to customers. And so the optimization of our overall grid for freight has created some pretty significant advantages. And it's one of the key advantages we find to being both in distribution and production in Brazil.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Let me just summarize that. I think over 10% or around 10% of our total synergies and run rate for this year will be created through transportation and logistics, particularly the optimization, as Rick said, of the new freight grid and, of course, the optimization of the use of the Port of TIPLAM.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning, guys. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more on what you've been doing and seeing now that you've been running the Brazilian assets for almost three months \u2013 for more than three months. And as a follow-up, I know there was a condition on the purchase that would have you pay an extra payout with high phosphate prices. We clearly seem to be in that territory. I realize it's a good problem to have, but could you talk a little bit about how that payout is structured and what do you expect to pay out this year?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Jonas. Good morning to you as well. Look, let me start with talking about what we're seeing in Brazil. I've been down there a couple of times this year already and Rick's down there, of course, all the time, so we're going to give it over to Rick, but let me summarize. The trips that Rick and I have taken together, I guess, one of the things that's probably encouraging to us is we see the opportunities as probably better than what we had expected. And our confidence in reaching our targets is better than what it would have been three months ago.","And let me come back to kind of some of the high-level things we're seeing that give us that level of confidence. First, of course, is the markets are better than what they were even six months ago, which is starting to give us some real tailwinds. But just to put what we've done ourselves, already in the first quarter, we have been able to increase productivity at these operations through a combination of debottlenecking, recovery improvements, shift changes and people reduction where we're seeing a total productivity in terms of phosphoric acid per full-time employee of about 43% across the business.","And so, now our level of confidence that we can get that $100 million run rate to flow through all the way through COGS this year is quite high. And Rick just talked on the last question about the transport advantages. You start adding those up, and those give us a great deal of confidence in where we're going long term in that business.","Rick, do you want to talk a little bit more about Brazil and where we feel (35:06)?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Good morning, Jonas. One of the things that \u2013 a significant takeaway and visitors that we've had through are amazed. We're making some pretty significant changes. We've made structural changes at plants in the first month of operation. We've looked at how we look at shifts, how we look at different \u2013 we're changing a lot of things in the business. But the energy from the people to support that change is tremendous. There's quite a bit of support.","People see things that need to be changed and needed to be changed. And as we've looked for this $100 million that we're talking about run rate for the first quarter, probably over half of that came from the bottom-up, from the people that are operating our plants that see the changes that need to be made and are willing to step up and say, hey, we should think about doing this different. And this idea of looking to do things different is something we're building on and is really quite exciting to see how this will roll into our busier second and third quarters.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Your next question was on the provisional payments to Vale based on the market conditions and, yes, we are getting closer to it. And I'm going to hand it over to Tony to give you a little more detail on that, Jonas. But what I will say is I absolutely agree with you, both Vale and Mosaic would be extremely happy if we had to pay out that contingent payment. So, Tony, do you want to just talk about the details?","Anthony T. Brausen - The Mosaic Co.","Certainly, Joc. Good morning, Jonas. As Joc said, we'd be thrilled if we're into this territory, but don't expect it. In fact, our full-year guidance would have to be higher if we got into the earn-out\/payout levels. And just to illustrate, at today's reais level, which is in the 3.50s, we'd need an average MAP price for the rest of this year approaching $500 for a delivered Brazil. So, again, we're not expecting it to reach that level, but we'd be thrilled if it did.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. All of our business would greatly benefit from that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. So, let's say, Brazil's going to plan. So, what did you sort of learn the last few months that made you change the overall tax guidance of 20% to 30% because it does look like phosphate is doing better than you thought? And then what would be your tax guide for 2019? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Joel. Let me touch on that, and I'm going to hand it over to Tony again, of course. Yes, you're right. We have increased our GAAP effective tax rate to the high 20s from the low 20s, and it's really driven by a higher mix of earnings from Brazil. Brazil has a tax rate of 34% and, of course, those are no longer deductible against U.S. taxes. So, this new tax law changes that.","And I have to say, at this point, we've optimized our operations under the old tax laws. And although we're going to change that and try to optimize against the new tax laws, in the transition, there are some quirks that will drive higher taxes.","Now, what I would want to really note, though, is cash taxes are expected to remain immaterial through 2018. In Brazil, we expect to pay zero tax because we have VAT taxes we've previously paid that will offset any of our cash income tax this year. In Canada, depreciation against our Esterhazy mine provides material cash benefits allowing us to pay low tax in Canada. And in the U.S., because of the alternative minimum tax change, we expect to actually receive cash back and AMT refunds will exceed any cash tax liability.","And so that's important to note that these are not cash taxes, but actual GAAP taxes. Over time, we expect our normalized tax rate to go back to the mid to low 20s as opposed to where we were before. But, certainly, for this year and next year, cash taxes we expect to remain very close to zero. Tony, what have I got to miss there?","Anthony T. Brausen - The Mosaic Co.","Joc, I think the only thing I'd add is in terms of Joel's question on what's driving the Brazil earnings movements from our prior forecast and I think it's a combination of the synergy realization that's been talked about already, the improved market prices and the devaluation of the reais, which benefits us as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thank you. Joc, can you give us a little more sense of the kind of synergy gains that you already have in the bag that are going to flow through in 2018? You mentioned freight being about 10% of it. And second question, is there anything different in the MicroEssentials demand that is going to cause the volume in that segment to be different than the overall trend in P&K? That's it.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Mark. I'm going to hand a little of this over to Rick, obviously, to talk a little more detail on Brazil and maybe Corrine as well to touch on some of the global demand issues for \u2013 or not issues, but opportunities for MicroEssentials. But let me at a very high level bucket some of the synergies we're able to achieve here.","We expect about 48% \u2013 let's call it 50% of the total synergies coming from the operational opportunities, which I discussed, which are better use of our maintenance time, shift changes which allow more time on the equipment, operational attention, debottlenecking and an easy one, we have increased the recovery of phosphoric acid at Uberaba by simply picking up some areas where we were actually spilling from one process stream to another, the P205. So those things we're doing now, we're really focused on that. So that's about half of that synergy for this year.","The next one, organization, and that's restructuring of the operation, commercial and finance teams to really take better advantage of the needs and really benchmark against other jurisdictions where the manpower per tonne, let's say, is lower.","The next one is procurement. 15% of our expected earnings will be \u2013 or improvement will come from procurement. Supply chain, and Rick talked about those, in line freight optimization, the optimization of TIPLAM, is about another 9%. And then another 8% or so come from commercial improvements, which is really what is the opportunity between the two cross-selling and selling more gypsum, selling new products, transferring some of our SSP from outside suppliers to internal. So, all of that stuff is leading to a lot of really good opportunity for us.","Rick, do you want to expand on that?","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Well, you've got a pretty good list, Joc. And I think the one thing that we need to go back and talk about is how we expect this to show up in the P&L as earnings. So we expect that during the first half of the year, we'll see about a third of this $100 million go to the P&L and the remainder will be in the back half of the year. I think the key piece that drives that is we make changes to the operations. They first have to go through inventory for us to turn it into cash.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And your next question, Mark, was on the MicroEssentials trends, and I'm going to get Corrine to talk about it. But I will say that product continues to do very well, continues to grow and I suspect it will not be that long until production limitations become the limitation to growth again.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","I would just add, Joc, great point. We are seeing strong MicroEssentials growth, both in North America but also globally. It's interesting to see the very rapid pace of growth in our MicroEssentials and really all of our premium products internationally as well as in North America.","Additionally, on price, the market in pricing premiums remain intact for these products. They truly are adding value for farmers. And so I think that's what's really driving the price premiums we've been able to realize and the demand growth. And Joc is right. It will not be long before we are debating about expanding further for our production capability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning. I had a couple questions. First, on the rail logistics, maybe just help us with the dynamic of CNR versus CP. My understanding is Canpotex is \u2013 roughly 70% of it is hauled by CP, is that correct? And who is your main carrier into the U.S. and how much will they carry for (44:47) you? Second question just really on the global potash market, commenting on strength you're seeing there, in your mind, what are the big drivers there?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Jacob. Let me start by saying we have a contract for North America through CP. Canpotex does do the majority of their haulage through the Canadian Pacific with a good portion \u2013 I'm not sure the exact number, Corrine might have the exact number of CN. Clearly, if we're hauling to the East Coast, that is a CN haul. If we're hauling to the West Coast, that is predominantly Canadian Pacific, including if we're hauling to Portland because that is actually Canadian Pacific and then traded off to I think the UP or something, isn't it correct? So, anyway \u2013 but I'll get Corrine to answer that, and maybe while she's at it \u2013 or Mike, you can answer the global potash demand question after.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Okay.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. And I do not have an exact split on the Canpotex proportion that is CP versus CN. Certainly, for Mosaic, we have a contract with CP, and that's our primary carrier. And for potash demand, I'll hand it off to Mike.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Hey. Good morning, Jacob. Yeah, potash demand continues to look very robust, as you probably know from the recent statistics. We estimate the demand increased about almost 7% in 2017 or over 4 million tonnes to 65 million tonnes. We think we'll see another 2.6% or 1.7-million-tonne increase in 2018. And again, demand growth is fairly broad-based.","We do think China, after imports being down and implied shipments being down a little bit in 2017 or at least at lower levels, we'll see a nice rebound there this year. And then across the board increases, led by everywhere from Brazil where we expect continued growth in demand as soybean acres continue to increase a little bit there; Indonesia, Malaysia, all of the majors accounting for the bulk of the growth. But the bottom line is we think 2.6%, which is right in line with our long-term CAGR of about 2.5% over the next five years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Could you discuss the benefit of purchase accounting adjustments on inventory of $30 million in the first quarter and $20 million in the second quarter? I normally think about that as a headwind rather than a tailwind when you write up acquired inventory. Because when you sell it, you don't have any profit initially, so how are you getting a benefit there?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, John. I'm going to hand that straight to Tony to explain, but I can tell you in broad terms that you're right, normally, that is a tailwind. However, there was some high-priced inventory that was revalued on the purchase. And, Tony, do you want to talk about that?","Anthony T. Brausen - The Mosaic Co.","Certainly, Joc. Good morning, John. You're right. Oftentimes that purchase accounting adjustment heads the opposite direction from \u2013 and is typically a tailwind, as you said. In our case \u2013 or sorry, it's typically a benefit. In our case, it's a tailwind. And the reason for that is that we revalue all of the inventory at a market value in terms of the inventory that was acquired. So, on the day of the acquisition, back in January, we acquired inventory that had been produced under the Vale Fertilizantes ownership and those production costs were higher than market. And so, as of the date of the acquisition, we record that inventory at a market value, which was lower than that previous production cost. So that results in the benefit that you saw in our results, which we've disclosed.","We also revalue all of the assets, as you may know, from a purchase accounting standpoint. So that affects things like depreciation as well as ARO accounting, asset retirement obligation accounting, a variety of things. Every asset and liability is recorded at market. So, there's a number of adjustments. Included in that is the inventory adjustment.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. And I can say in summary to that, John, as you buy this business, you've got to expect a lot of noise in the first couple of quarters. There's just a lot of things that are changing, as Tony said, whether it's the change in depreciation rates, change in purchase accounting for inventory considerations. But in answer to the other piece of your question, I mean, we must say that if you look at the pro formas, this business was underperforming, and because of that, it's a little different than a normal acquisition.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Oliver S. Rowe - Scotiabank","It's Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Thanks for taking my question. So, does the phosphate supply gap that you mentioned change your decision on restarting Plant City? Do you think that that project still makes sense in your portfolio? And what sort of, I guess, phosphate prices or stripping margins do you think you need to make it work?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Oliver. Let me hit that one rather than getting into too much detail on it, but let me summarize. By idling Plant City and optimizing our phosphate production assets, we effectively tightened the supply. And in spite of new supply coming on, we saw the industry benchmarks increase materially. So, at the same time, this action also lowered our production costs and allowed us to continue to meet our customer demand. So, from our perspective, we think that's pretty good.","The net result was a significant increase in our profitability across all of our 16 million tonnes that we produce in our phosphate in both Florida and Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil. So, all I can say at this stage is we will revisit Plant City in the fourth quarter, but we really feel that what we did there was exactly what we needed to do and what the market needed at the time.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Go ahead, please. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thank you. Just in terms of further developing the Brazilian market, how are you thinking about sort of the long term, especially developing northern port access further and also just obviously consequently reducing your own costs? Do you foresee yourself as a leader here? And also just do you have any quick views on the political front, given elections later this year? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Well, thanks, Chris. That's a fair bit to cover, the last one we could probably talk about for hours. But let me start about the Brazilian market development. I think over time, northern access and that whole access to the Tocantins area and, call it, Northwest Mato Grosso is a definite it's going to happen. It's a question of when.","And I think as it happens, that's one of the big opportunities I think for us particularly on a distribution side because we're going to be a group that can really get in there and be leaders in that space. So I definitely think we are now the production leader in Brazil. We're certainly one of a couple of distribution leaders and I think that relative size compared to the market really allows us to take opportunities that others may not be able to do.","So I'm going to hand it to Rick to just talk about this a little bit and he may be able to give you some insight into the politics, although those are pretty muddy.","Richard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.","Are they ever, Joc? Good morning, Chris. I think as you look at northern access to Brazil, it is going to grow. And I think the precursor to that is the grain movements that are going there and year-over-year increase in grain movements has been really quite significant through the northern outlet, which is improving the basis for farmers in the area because they're spending less money on logistics.","The back movement of fertilizer hasn't been growing at the pace because there's infrastructure that needs to be developed. That will be developed over the next couple years. But in the position we're in is both in production and distribution across the major production areas we'll definitely be involved in the development of the northern access to the Brazil Cerrados.","As far as the politics go, I will stay completely out of it. It's in a state of flux, just like a lot of other countries, and stay tuned. This one is coming fast.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","The only thing too I will say about Brazil and I think it's worthy of mentioning was you talked about politics is despite the economic, political and lack of reform that they're able to get now with sort of a lame duck government, if you will, with the new election coming this fall, I will say, the ag sector has been a real standout and continues to grow. And I think this Northwest Corridor will really be the next horizon of growth for Brazil and maybe for the world from an agricultural perspective.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. With that, look, I hear a rumor out there that another company may be reporting today. So I'm going to call it in now and allow you guys to get on with the rest of your day.","But, in closing, let me just say a couple of words here which is, first of all, as we look forward this year, we see strong EBITDA growth. We're now guiding to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion in 2018, which is up about 50% on a midpoint from last year. So we're seeing some real benefits. We're starting to see the Mosaic Fertilizantes take a real stand and we now have gone from expecting it to be somewhat neutral in terms of EPS to now being accretive to probably in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 accretive and contribute in the range of $300 million of EBITDA to our business.","So we're really starting to see an investment that is going to quickly show real dividends for the company and a real opportunity for growth into the future. So, overall, with the markets, we're very confident on the year. We're starting to see some changes that we think are important in the ag space and in our space.","But let me conclude then with the three \u2013 reiterate our key messages. Our business did perform well in the first quarter of the year and we expect strong markets and our good execution to continue through 2018. The work we've done and are doing to transform our potash, phosphates and Fertilizantes business are delivering meaningful long-term value. And as I said earlier, we're ahead of schedule in Brazil and we're really excited for the prospects there.","So, overall, Mosaic is executing very well, markets continue to improve and we are generating substantial momentum.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the Company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today\u2019s call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and year and our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will provide an update on our capital management and share insights into our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call.

They are based on managements' beliefs and expectations as of today's date, February 11, 2014 and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I would like to turn it over to Jim.","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning all. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2013 earnings discussion. I will start by acknowledging the obvious; the external business environment impacted our results. Potash and phosphate prices were low. Although phosphate prices began to move upward in December, but our outlook is rosier. We are starting to see some rays of sunlight at the end of this tunnel and Mosaic is extremely well positioned for the day light to come.","We also were and are an excellent position to succeed through this prop of the cycle. Potash prices fell by approximately $130 per tonne during the calendar 2013 year and phosphate prices fell by $150 per tonne. Because of those steep declines, we generated $179 million in operating earnings during the quarter on sales of $2.2 billion.","For the calendar year we earned $1.1 billion or $9 billion in revenue and generated $2 billion in operating cash flow. Well these numbers fell short of a calendar 2012 results, our ability to generate meaningful earnings and operating cash flow in the trough of the cycle demonstrates the resilience we\u2019ve built into our business model.","Strong volumes and reduced inventory drove operating cash flows in excess of $500 million for the quarter. In turn we invested $370 million. Clearly we managed Mosaic for the long-term. We want to deliver shareholder value across the cycle and we are positioning the company to do just that.","We believe the business cycle is beginning to turn in our favor. We said this many times over the past year and it is coming true, volume comes before price. That is to say, we expect to see shipping volumes increase before prices turn upward. As you can see in the presentation accompanying our discussion today, that exact scenario happened in phosphates. Prices hit bottom during the fourth quarter and volumes accelerated to record levels, which in turn moved DAP prices upward.","Coupled with lower year-over-year raw material costs, this all bodes well for margin improvement in phosphates in the coming quarters. In potash price have seem to found the bottom following the recent contracts with China and the beginning of upward price momentum in Brazil.","We need further demand increases to tighten the global supply and demand balance before we can expect significant price improvements. Now it's important for you to understand that we do not expect dramatic short-term potash price increases. The downward part of the cycle is prolonged and we expect the upward swing to take time as well. But we do expect better operating conditions in the second half of this year.","We have always known that our markets are cyclical and we\u2019ve prepared Mosaic to succeed in the peaks, troughs, and everywhere in between. Difficult markets often present excellent opportunities and we have made rapid and important strategic progress over the past year and the pace of progress accelerated during our seven-month stub period.","I\u2019d like to cover some of the highlights. We expect to close the CF Industries phosphate acquisition in the near future, pending additional regulatory approvals. The additional 1.8 million tonnes of phosphate capacity will bring our capacity to approximately 11.5 million tonnes ensuring Mosaic\u2019s place as the largest Finnish phosphate producer in the world.","In potash, at our Esterhazy mine, we recently completed an extremely successful Canpotex proving run. In fact the run exceeded the expansions design capacity by 20%. Our potash expansions continued on budget and on schedule despite a rising cost environment, in Saskatchewan and challenging conditions in the global potash market. Our Esterhazy K3 mine shaft has reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet on its way to 3,600 foot level.","Our long-term ammonia supply agreement with CF Industries will allow us to purchase up to 725,000 tonnes annually for 15 years with pricing based on a formula tied to the prevailing price of U.S natural gas. The agreement will begin when CF completes its plant expansion in the Louisiana.","Along with our joint venture partners Ma\u2019aden and SABIC, we broke ground last week on the new integrated phosphate complex in Saudi Arabia. The project remains on schedule and on budget, and when complete, we expected to be among the lowest cost phosphate facilities in the world.","Mosaic extended its product innovation lead. For the first year ever, we invoiced more than 1 million tonnes of MicroEssentials to customers in North America. We are streamlining our supply chain logistics on Tampa Bay with the construction of 110,000 tonne state-of-the-art warehouse facility and the purchase of ammonia handling assets. These were not large investments. But it demonstrates our commitment to continuous efficiency improvements and high standards of operational excellence. Also in phosphates, we made good progress in our Central Florida mine permitting process.","As you are all well aware, we made several important strategic financial moves. Today we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in addition to the 43.3 million Class A shares we\u2019ve already agreed to purchase. This reflects our commitment to optimizing our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders.","In December, we effectively put our split-off transaction behind us by reaching an agreement to repurchase 43.3 million shares of Class A stock from the Margaret A. Cargill Trusts. We\u2019ve completed more than half of those repurchases which will continue through the middle of this year.","Also in November, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt at a very low average interest rate of approximately 5%, putting us insight of our stated leverage targets. And we reached agreement with our banks to significantly increase our revolving credit facility, allowing us to meet our stated liquidity targets.","We are committed to reaching the balance sheet targets we established last May, maintaining an investment grade rating and are confident we can generate cash flow to fund our investment agenda. And still more developments, we announced our intention to invest in additional distribution assets in Brazil, which is among the worlds most promising agricultural markets.","We're making good progress towards exiting our distribution business in Argentina and Chile, and decommissioning our small potash mine at Hersey, Michigan. Those elements of our business simply were not generating appropriate returns for our shareholders. We have also taken steps to ensure Mosaic will remain a low-cost operator.","As we outlined at our Analyst Day, in October, we\u2019re working to reduce cost across the Company, in both business units and in our support functions. On another note, we held a successful grand opening for the Lodge at Streamsong last month and the resort is now fully up and operating. I must tell you it is a spectacular place.","Finally, and in my mind most important, we set yet another new record for safety performance in our seven-month stub period. We achieved a 13% improvement in our key safety measure on the heels of two consecutive record periods. That\u2019s quite a list of accomplishments for seven months and all of it represents meaningful progress.","We are growing our business, securing our supply of raw materials, rationalizing our asset portfolio, creating a more efficient balance sheet and operating with excellence. We\u2019ve a lot to do in 2014 to bring these accomplishments to their full potential. But while we\u2019re engaged in the critical work of integration, expansion and cost reduction, we\u2019re not taking our eye away from additional opportunities. We will continue to push our innovation lead, we will look for additional growth opportunities and we will continue to work to optimize our balance sheet.","Now, I\u2019d like to ask Larry to address our financial results and our guidance. And then I will offer some concluding thoughts before we take your questions.","Larry Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I\u2019d like to begin by discussing our balance sheet strength and then I will move on to our results and outlook. Even after executing all the strategic actions Jim described, we continue to believe we\u2019ve substantial capital to return to our shareholders.","To date in 2014, we have repurchased 24.7 million shares for $1.1 billion. We have agreed to repurchase an additional 18.5 million shares between now and the end of July and as you saw by our announcement this morning our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, which could be accomplished through either direct or open market repurchases.","We are planning to issue short duration debt to finance the CF acquisition and expect to do so at attractive borrowing rates. While we intend to repay that debt relatively quickly with cash from operations, it will add to the current $37 million per quarter debt related interest expense.","It\u2019s important for you to understand that we will remain appropriately conservative in our approach to capital redeployment, paying close attention to our financial priorities as well as to changing external conditions.","Now, I will move on to our results for the quarter. First, until we complete the current Class A share repurchase process; we will report our earnings per share using a two class method. So even though the full 43.3 million Class A shares have already been taken out of our official outstanding share count, for modeling purposes the simplest approach is to assume those shares are outstanding until we actually close on the shares repurchased.","Second, we also had a significant discrete tax item that factored into our reported earnings for the quarter. As a result of a tax settlement between governments, we changed our intention to repatriate earnings from our Canadian operations, resulting in an approximately $100 million non-cash P&L charge. The decision will also modestly increase our 2014 tax rate, but it is not expected to impact our tax rate beyond 2014.","In phosphates, we sold a record 3.4 million tonnes of product clearly reflecting the volume before price pattern we expected. The heavy sales volume reduced our year-end inventories. Our gross margin rate in the segment was 12%, lower than in prior quarters primarily due to the decline in average realized prices and lower realized margins on crop nutrient blends sold through our international distribution business.","Raw material costs have declined and we expect that trend to carry into the first quarter, more on that in a minute. Our operating rate in phosphates for the quarter was down slightly to 81% due to scheduled annual maintenance turnarounds.","In Potash net sales increased compared with both the sequential and year-ago quarter as a result of both the late fall application season and the pent-up demand Jim mentioned. Prices declined further to an average MLP selling price of $303 per tonne. As a result, our gross margin rate for the segment decreased to 21%.","Our operating rate declined to 65% as ongoing production curtailments at Colonsay were partially offset by the highly successful Esterhazy proving run. Ammonia and sulfur prices declined during the quarter. Ammonia costs were $422 per tonne and sulfur prices were $123 per tonne, down from $486 and $167 per tonne, respectively, in the prior quarter.","On a year-over-year comparison basis while ammonia costs were lower, an extended maintenance turnaround at Faustina had a roughly $9 million negative impact on gross margin within the segment. Also, keep in mind that market prices for raw materials takes some time to be reflected in our cost of goods sold. Despite the recently increasingly raw material market prices, we expect to realize low sulfur and ammonia costs in the first quarter of 2014.","Now, I will turn to guidance. In phosphates sales volumes are expected to range from 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes for the first quarter compared with 2.7 million tonnes in the same period of 2013. We believe some of the record sales in the fourth quarter pulled volume from our first quarter and our inventories for new sales in the first quarter are mostly committed. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $390 to $420 per tonne. The gross margin rate for the phosphate segment is expected to increase to the upper teens as we see the benefits of higher prices and lower raw material costs.","Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to be in the low 80% range during the first quarter. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes much of which has already been committed. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $245 to $275 per tonne. Keep in mind our recent proving run of Esterhazy increased our Canpotex allocation to 42.5% and that is factored into the price and volume guidance.","Our gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to improve to around 30%. Our operating rate in potash during the first quarter is expected to be in the mid 80% range as we prepare for an expected strong spring season. For the full year 2014, brine management expenses are expected to be approximately $200 million and Canadian resource taxes and loyalties are expected to be in the range of $120 million to $180 million.","In addition, we expect full year SG&A expenses to range from $350 million to $400 million and an effective tax rate in the mid to high 20% range which includes the additional tax expenses I mentioned earlier. We expect capital expenditures for the year in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion.","Before I turn it back to Jim, I'd like to address our expense management initiatives which began years ago in phosphates through a program we call ROIC Works! and in potash through a program Momentum. We have consistently worked to lower costs and offset inflation. Our goal has always been to maintain or improve our low cost position and maximize free cash flows.","At our Analyst Day last fall, we showed you our plans to continue to maximize cash flows by cutting sustaining capital by $250 million per year and taking $200 million in annual costs out of each of our operating segments. Now, we've expanded our focus also actively engaged in reducing our corporate support function costs. We are committed to being a low cost producer of both nutrients across the business cycle.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his concluding remarks.","Jim Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. These are not the best of times in the crop nutrition industry but conditions are improving. During our last earnings call, I said that economics will win in the end and by that I meant that economic forces will outweigh temporary interventions in the market. That's proving to be true now as excess supply has been absorbed by strong demand leaving producers with limited phosphate inventories and lower potash inventories. We believe once again that economics will win and that prices will rise over time in response to more balance supply and demand dynamics.","That said, plenty of factors always influence the markets not the least of which is grain and oilseed prices. The record 2013 crop has sent the 2014 December U.S. corn futures to about $4.50 per bushel and it remains to be seen how that and the South American harvest will affect spring planting in the North America. Farmers still can make money at these grain prices, especially given the affordability of crop nutrients. Of course broader economic issues including the apparent slowing growth in emerging nations could impact global farmer behavior.","But longer term forces are undeniably in our favor. I talked frequently about population growth over 21st century and the compounding challenge it poses on global agriculture. But we can't ignore that the compounding has already begun. The challenge is upon us now. The United Nations estimates that to meet demand global food production must increase by 50% by 2030, that's just 16 years from now.","Consider that for a moment. By the time my new born granddaughter can drive legally in the U.S., we'll have to be producing 3 bushels for every 2 today and 6 hogs for every 4. Perhaps more arable land will come into production, but either way the existing farmland simply must produce more, a lot more and it must do so sustainably. And crop nutrition is absolutely essential to farmers' ability to meet this staggering challenge.","At Mosaic we have built a resilient business capable of prospering through cycles and we have seized many opportunities during this challenging time to strengthen our franchise for the decades ahead. There is light at the end of this tunnel and there is tremendous promise beyond.","Now, we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thanks a lot. We've seen yourself and some of your Canpotex partners announce $20 a tonne potash price increases in various markets, including the U.S., Brazil, Southeast Asia, maybe you could talk about when you see those price increases first time they're going to get tested and if you've had any progress on those? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Well, good morning, Joel Jackson. Good to hear you on this call. Those prices just went in. We're starting to see some of the uptake on that starting in the international markets and we're getting some good interest at this point in the domestic market in North America. I'm going to ask Rick McLellan to give you some color on just that. Rick?","Rick McLellan","Yes, good morning, Joe. You're right and I'll start in North America where we announced our price increase effective Friday. And as normally happens with price increases, the North American buyers have come in and committed for that increase. So we won't see those price realizations until the second quarter. We'll see the current price until then because we'll be \u2013 our shipments are going to be at that price level. So that \u2013 when buyers came in this quarter they bought about two-thirds of what they're going to need for spring. And so we feel that's in a good position and prices are going to move into the second quarter. And then to the look at the international markets, I think you just need to use Brazil as a proxy. We've seen prices increase in Brazil since the start of the year, up $40 a tonne. And part of that is that it's driven by market conditions in Brazil where carryout inventories were lower year-on-year and frankly the economics of soybean productions are very good.","Laura Gagnon","Operator, are you there?","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Thank you and good morning everyone. Just sort of a follow-up on pricing and customer dynamics; I guess, what I\u2019m wondering is, do you think as we move out of the first half of the year -- out of the spring season to the second half of the year. Do you think you\u2019re going to continue with the upward price momentum or do you think we\u2019re going to have more of a seasonal pattern or there\u2019ll have to be sort of some summer fill prices and then, prices maybe -- you\u2019ll expect to drift higher as we get into the fall season or are you thinking that there\u2019s going to be sort of the traditional potash sort of stair step higher only in one direction through the year?","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Vincent, I am going to ask Rick McLellan our commercial manager and perhaps Mike Rahm could weigh in on that as well. Rick.","Rick McLellan","Yes good morning Vincent. Frankly what we do know is that we\u2019re in a position where volume has begun to move quite substantially on the potash side. So first will come volume, then it will become the price momentum. And we see that momentum carrying through the second quarter. And frankly if, and Mike can talk about it, but we do expect demand to increase around the globe. And we think that probably boards very well for price momentum into the second half of the year.","Mike Rahm","Yes, Vincent I would just add that, when you look at potash fundamentals if our global shipment forecast of 57 to 59 million tonnes is on target, we see fundamentals coming into a very good balance in the second half of the year. So I think that boards well for sustaining the price increases that have been announced recently. And in the case of phosphate, I would just comment that we have seen this 40% run in prices since the end of November without any impact from India and we believe that India has an appetite for phosphate imports that\u2019s 2 million tonnes greater this year than it was last year. So fundamentally I think there\u2019s an argument to be made that there certainly is forces that will elevate prices.","Jim Prokopanko","Vincent along with the -- I\u2019ll just add, its Jim here. I\u2019ll just add that along with that point about the international markets in particular India, that card is yet to be played. Couple of other things we\u2019re watching is; what happens to grain and oilseed prices as we approach the spring planting season, that will have some impact in how the Brazilian oilseed crop develops from hereon is going to have an impact and much is yet to be played out. The other thing that we\u2019re watching is the transportation. I have been in this business over 30 years. We\u2019ve never not gotten our customers all the products they need. However this year has really been a real test with serious ice on the river in the U.S. with serious snows -- really, really serious snows in Western Canada. We\u2019re facing transportation issues and backlogs unlike we ever have before. The frigid, frigid temperatures have reduced the railways shipping, there instead of shipping 100 car, 120 car trains they\u2019re limited to 50 car trains, trains are getting stuck in the snow and dealers and buyers are starting to get tuned into that story. If we have an early spring, snow goes away, no flooding, we\u2019ll get the product there in time. But right now we\u2019re struggling to keep up on the logistic side with the demand we have. So a couple of big question marks hanging over the market going into the spring season. If there\u2019s transportation problem\u2019s you can be sure that we\u2019re going to see considerable more upside price pressure on the potash that is available in the country.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Thanks, good morning. I guess two questions. The first is with the new $1 billion share repurchase that you\u2019ve announced, when do you expect to complete that? And secondly in your -- and in your slide deck you show 58 million tonnes of potash demand in 2014. I think global potash demand was 53 million tonnes in 2013. So where did the 5 million extra tonnes come from?","Jim Prokopanko","Well good day Jeff. I am going to have our CFO, Larry Stranghoener talk to you about the share purchase and our thoughts on timing. And then Mike Rahm you can address the question about the outlook with potash demand is coming near. Larry.","Larry Stranghoener","Good morning, Jeff. The additional $1 billion share repurchase authorization should be seen in context of what we announced early last summer. We clearly stated our balance sheet priorities and this authorization is intended to get us to those balance sheet targets by the middle of this year. Our board has given us full authorization and then a lot of flexibility with respect to just how we hope to fill this remaining $1 billion authorization. It should be clear. We like the price of the stock right now, and so we could be active relatively soon and we\u2019ll give up the excess appropriate.","Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan","Okay.","Mike Rahm","Hi, good morning Jeff, this is Mike. Just a couple of things, the first our estimate for 2013 shipments is closer to 54 million tonnes. I think our point estimate right now is 53.9. So we see a 4 million tonne increase in global potash shipments in 2014, and that\u2019s made up of the following. We think China we\u2019ll see 800,000 tonne increase in shipments there that is made up of about 500,000 tonne increase in net imports coupled with about a 300,000 tonne increase in their domestic production. If you add to China, about 200,000 tonne increases in Malaysia and Indonesia that gives you the first million tonnes. We expect India will import a million tonnes more potash this year than a year ago. And then, we also have about a million tonne increase in the former Soviet Union, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And there we see greater use for NPK compound production that is going to be sold to domestic and offshore customers as well as greater demand for direct application use particularly in the Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union. And then we have about 500,000 tonne increase expected in Brazil in terms of their overall shipments. And then the other half million tonnes comes from the rest of the world including North America, other Central American countries and so forth. So, that\u2019s the breakdown of the 4 million tonne increase that we see.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jacob Bout from CIBC. Your line is open.","Jacob Bout - CIBC","Hi, good morning, couple of questions here on Esterhazy. So you said that, the shaft is down a 1000 feet. How deep is it or how far down are you going to K3 and when do you go through the aquifer? And then just on the brine inflow cost, you gave some guidance here for the full-year of 2014, it looks like it's dropping off and what's this a function of?","Jim Prokopanko","Well, good morning Jacob, good to hear from you. I am going to just turn it over to Joc in one minute, but I got to tell you, this sinking a shaft 3600 feet to the ore body is no small task. Many have tried, many have failed. We are proceeding well. We have great safety performance on this shaft sinking. We are on our budgets on it and we are on our timeline and that\u2019s not something everybody could say. So, with that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Joc to tell you a little bit more of the details of the shaft sinking and he will address the brine inflow cost estimates.","Joc O'Rourke","Hello Jacob, Joc O'Rourke here. Yes, we are at about a 1,000 feet on the one shaft slightly behind that on the second shaft, but we will be hitting the aquifer -- for your first question, we\u2019ll be hitting the aquifer at about 1,200 to 1,300 feet. We\u2019ll actually start lining for that aquifer starting at more like 1,100 feet. So within the next month we\u2019ll actually be lining for that aquifer and through it by probably mid March early -- mid April early May. In terms of the total depth for the K3 shaft, Jim mentioned that, that goes to approximately 3600 feet. So that was your first question. Your second question on Esterhazy brine inflow. As you\u2019re very aware we\u2019ve been managing this for a long time, certainly nature plays a big piece of the cost. But we believe some of the initiatives we took and talked about a year ago have really helped us control our cost and manage that in a much more day-to-day operational as opposed to emergency base. We have done some good technology work that has really helped to stabilize those costs.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Bank","Thank you very much. Can you just talk about the dynamic of what's going on in India right now? It seems like they've become the swing buyer of both potash and phosphate and so where are we with the subsidy? Obviously the fiscal year is a couple months away and the elections as well. And how do you think about how India could kind of swing back and forth on both potash and phosphate?","Jim Prokopanko","Good day, Ben. I'm going to turn it over to Rick McLellan, our Commercial leader to address that. The other piece that he'll address is the India inventories and how badly they've been drawn down, depleted. That's a story that goes a bit unnoticed, but Rick why don't you add some descriptions around that.","Rick McLellan","Yes, there's a lot to your question, Ben. I'll try and cover it all. But first of the question is where are we at with subsidies. The expectation that we get from our Indian customers is that we will hear something about subsidies earlier than we have in the past, but it will get itself dealt with probably within the next 60 days which would be earlier than what we've seen. So that's the one thing. We think that will be behind us within the next 60 days. Then when you talk about phosphates on the swing, last year India imported about 3.5 million tonnes of phosphates and when you take a look at it, that probably is the low point because as Jim said what gets missed is there was 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes of pipeline inventory in pace close to the farmer that frankly hadn't been counted. So to have the same deliveries to farmers they've had last year, their demand is going to be in the 5.5 million tonne range we believe and frankly that could be higher depending on what happens in the marketplace. We're really at a point right now with phosphates where farmers are seeing what's happening in global markets and their returns are very good. Potash is a bit of similar situation. We saw their imports drop to just around 3 million tonnes. We believe there's 1 million tonnes more could be imported this year as pipeline inventories have been drawn down. So frankly we see the back half of the year the opportunity for India to come in and probably move more volumes than they have in the past. The price will be at a level that they haven't seen in several years and there is a need at the farm level for these products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Chris Parkinson - Credit Suisse","Can you just comment a little bit on the margins in the phosphate business due to the significant variation in ammonia and sulfur prices over the last two quarters? When I looked at your slide deck, it looks like you've benefited from ammonia but not as much as sulfur despite lower prices in 4Q. Can you just give a little guidance on all your expectations for the first half of '14 including the lags and the realization in costs please? Thank you.","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, Chris. I'm going to have Joc O'Rourke, COO, address the raw material costs.","Joc O'Rourke","Good morning, Chris. Yes, so just quickly certainly ammonia prices have been trending down and we expect them to trend down next quarter as well as because of slightly higher operating rates at Faustina, our realized price for ammonia will go down. Sulfur has also been trending down although there's a lot of pressure in the international markets with large rises in prices in the international, but we expect our sulfur price to also trend down in the quarter. And a lot of that is due to lag. We hold reasonably high inventories of those two products, so it takes a while for those to move through our system and then into our actual cost of goods sold.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial","Thank you. A question on the potash outlook, maybe it's for Mike Rahm. Mike in that rebound in shipments from 54 to 57 to 59, how much of this is inventory rebuilding? Are we just looking at kind of a pipeline rebuild this year or what's actually happening to the underlying consumption? And then I noticed longer term, your Slide 24 shows operating rates for potash globally peaking this year and while shipments are going up with higher capacity, operating rates come down. So wondering what impact these lower operating rates have on your price outlook going forward?","Mike Rahm","Good morning, Don. Thanks for the question. Just in terms of how much of the increase in shipments is the result of the pipeline drawdown, that's a tough number, but I would say that there probably is a good 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes when you take a look at the potential pipeline drawdown that we've seen in the past. In terms of the other components of your question, we're projecting around 58 million tonnes of shipments this year relative to our capacity estimate that's in that probably 65 million to 66 million tonne range in terms of effective capacity. I think what's important there is the Brownfield capacity that has come on is in the hands of major producers, so we don't see that operating rate as something that raises a bunch of the other red flags in terms of price impact. And as I said earlier, when we look our projected supply and demand balance getting into the second half of the year, we see the market coming into a much better balance the second half than what we've seen for the past couple of years as you know by following North American inventories we've chugged about 3 million tonnes of inventories for quite a while and we see that getting pulled down to normal or average levels in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","Yes. Hi. Good morning. I think in the past you have talked about or Mike Rahm has talked about how global DAP inventories have come down globally. I'm wondering if you can talk about where do you see this DAP and maybe potash inventories currently? And secondly as DAP prices have run up 40% from the bottom, are you seeing a supply response either from Morocco or Middle East?","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning, PJ. I'll let Mike talk about those inventories. That's a top question given the state of reporting of inventories. On your question has there been a demand response or supply response from competition, the North African producers are struggling with some serious, serious North Atlantic storms. There has been some delays in shipping. There's about 20 vessels waiting and it probably is going to be until the end of April before \u2013 so sometime in April before the backlog is going to clear. There is \u2013 some of the shippers are just having a hard time with the swells at the port facilities. So we've seen supplies unnaturally pinched in the last couple of weeks. People are producing at a high level of production. I've seen some Eastern European producers report 100% production levels. So I'd say the worldwide industry is already production at very near back to whole capacity and it's going to be hard to accelerate that production rate. And maybe with one of the North African producers coming back into the market that's about the best of it, but we have a tight S&D balance rate now as it is. So the response is people are shipping and producing as much as they possibly can and I'd say the world is coming up a bit short. Mike, do you want to touch on the \u2013 can you touch on the worldwide P&P inventories?","Mike Rahm","Sure. Good morning, PJ. I think we highlighted this in our last issue of Market Mosaic which we titled Picking Up the Knife. These markets have been in a bear run for two years and if you \u2013 during that period of time, you would expect that all distributors are going to minimize the amount of inventory that they carry and we think that certainly has happened. And I think the poster child for that is India and we provided our analysis at an outlook presentation we made at the TFI conference in November as well as the AgCollege presentation that we made in January and I think both of those presentations are available that we go through and highlight the drawdown that we think has occurred in India. And in that case we think wholesale and retail inventories in India have been drawn down to about 2.5 million tonnes over the past year. And while the drawdown hasn't been as dramatic in other parts of the world. I think that the trend is correct, that everyone is trying to maintain very lean inventories and once you get a trigger where people then believe that the bottom is in. What's happened is that we had to rush to the market, and we\u2019ve had several other factors that have exacerbated it and you typically don\u2019t see 40% run in prices like we\u2019ve seen in phosphate due to one factor. I think it's been a combination of things. On one hand end user demand remains very good while add commodity prices are off from their highs last year. They still generate some very good on-farm returns. So end user demand is good. The pipeline we think is very lean. We have talked about some of the increases in raw material cost, the logistical challenges and then I think to sprinkle on top of that just the queens of impact of several planned or unplanned production outages and you have the ingredients for a very, very strong run and I guess I just reiterated what Jim said is that fundamentals in the phosphate market are extremely tight due to the combination of all those factors.","Jim Prokopanko","I\u2019ll just add one thing PJ. Since 2008 where global financial prices occurred, people had a real lesson in risk management and Mike said that, dealers and pipelines have gotten accustomed to dealing and are demanding that they have been there pipelines all the time and less inventory with price risk. Result is, we got this greater volatility that we had when people aren\u2019t buying it, it's applied to a declining market and maybe rapidly so and we test new bottoms. Yet when demand comes and we\u2019re convinced that demand will be choppy but steadily growing over time, but you\u2019re going to see these spikes and they\u2019re going to be somewhat unanticipated when you -- the storm in North Africa all of a sudden one of the major producers is having trouble shipping to Latin America and North America, it happens over night. So get used to it. I can\u2019t tell you we have calm waters ahead for the next -- anytime soon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Two question\u2019s on phosphates if I may. First, I think your Saudi joint venture broke ground, perhaps you could update us on the coming milepost there and whether or not you\u2019re running on time and on budget? And then second, I think you said MicroEssentials is above 1 million tonnes now. How high can that number go and perhaps you could comment on the margin differential between MicroEssentials and the balance of phosphates?","Jim Prokopanko","Okay, good day Kevin. Thanks for the question on the Saudi joint venture. We just did have the ground breaking this past week. I\u2019m going to just turn it over to Rich Mack, our GC who is the lead on the joint venture on the Board of Directors of the Ma'aden business. But before that, I just want to highlight what's coming up and I\u2019m enjoying it more questions about our phosphate business. This is what's distinguished us, we\u2019ve said that. It's been an under appreciated nutrient. And I think it's finally getting some respect, it's a Rodney Dangerfield of nutrients and it's time is here. And this is the, we believe the beauty of Mosaic is having the balance between potash and phosphate not both cylinders don\u2019t always fire, but usually one is going when the other is dormant. So we are seeing that now and we are just so confident about our phosphate business, the expansions we\u2019re doing in Saudi and CF. So with that prelude, and gave Rich Mack a chance to think about his answer. He can tell you about the mileposts and how we\u2019re doing relative to budget. Rich.","Richard Mack","Sure, thanks Jim. And Kevin with respect to the Ma\u2019aden joint venture, we\u2019ve awarded about 75% of the EBID packages on the joint venture and we\u2019ve been presently surprised with the numbers that we\u2019ve been seeing through that process. They generally have been below the budgeted levels and below the feasibility study, so that\u2019s been good news. We are about three or four left to award and we\u2019re in the process of reviewing those. We are also making great progress on the project financing component for Ma\u2019aden. That will be a milestone that we\u2019ll be looking at over the course of the next several months as well. You may recall that this project is basically broken into two parts, one is at Ras Al Khair basically the DAP processing and the port facilities, and then there is the mining operations and the beneficiation and the asset process up in the northern part of Saudi Arabia. So basically everything is moving forward as planned and as scheduled. We are on budget. Things are looking good and the infrastructure work and the progress now starting to put the assets in place first in the northern part of Saudi Arabia is ongoing right now. So stay tuned and we'll have more developments as time proceeds.","Jim Prokopanko","Okay. Rick, our Commercial leader, take the question about MES margins and perhaps say something about the volumes and some of the mileposts we\u2019ve hit.","Rick McLellan","Yes, good morning Kevin. On MicroEssentials we pointed out that we have reached 1,000,000 tonnes in North America which was a significant milepost. When you think about -- when we think about it, we have almost got a similar amount that we shipped internationally in the key markets in Brazil, Central America and Australia. And so we see really good demand. Our current productive capacity is a little over two in a quarter million tonnes and we\u2019re looking at opportunities to increase that because we're going to bump up against our productive capacity. It's been a really good story on developing ways to increase yields around the world as well is differentiating Mosaic as a supplier of phosphates.","As far as a margin delta, we shared some data when we were to -- when we were together at our Analyst Day and frankly we see $40 to $45 differential in gross margins for the MicroEssentials product mix. We continue to see opportunities where that can grow and we\u2019re looking at ways that we can both understand better value capture as well as understand how we could further improve our production capacity.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew Korn from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Korn - Barclays Equity Research","Hey, good morning Jim, everyone. On potash, a major competitor of yours highlighted a strategy to recalibrate their portfolio towards lower-cost operations during a period when demand is somewhat suboptimal. Reading through the release today your op capacity is 10.7 million tonnes, you\u2019re looking at mid 80s percentage wise operating range over the first quarter. So first, what kind of operating rate for you for the full-year would be consistent with 57 million, 59 million tonne market you\u2019re projecting and second is there any space today given your minds current operating rates to further redistribute production and give you an assist on the cost side? Thanks.","Jim Prokopanko","Good morning Matthew. Thanks for joining the call. You had a -- that was a big question and the first is about the low cost production. That is a -- that's an objective we stand by, its core to the business, which is basically a commodity business. We have been working on the momentum project Larry mentioned that in its comments where we're driving costs down. It's not a one-off event that we decide to do once and then business as usual. It's something you have to pursue everyday. We have been pursuing that, have taken some good costs out of our system and we\u2019ve some ambitious goals ahead. So we're not going to do a special announcement about our project. We talk about it in -- we talked about it at the New York Investor Call. I think we\u2019ve called out about $200 million or $250 million of costs that we\u2019re going to take out of our potash production over the next couple of years and its just regular day task that we do everyday and get our costs down to the where we\u2019re now in that bottom quartile and we\u2019re going to stay there. How we're going to run our operations, what we find is costs go up when you have highly variable production rates. If you\u2019re -- one day you're running at 10 million tonne rate or couple of months, the next quarter you're running at 8 million then you run at 10 -- 9 million, that drives our operations people crazy. So we're trying to calibrate that for a steady and stable operating rate. I'm going to turn it over to Joc, and he will share with you some of his ideas about the rates we think we need to operate that.","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, thanks Matthew. I think Jim has pretty much covered what you were looking for. Clearly next quarter we will be running in that 80% to 85% range and we expect to be running in that range. Clearly at that kind of level we\u2019d not be able to redistribute a portfolio as you suggested, but certainly we have our higher cost operations as we outlined in our Investors meeting and we have some lower cost ones and particularly Esterhazy now with its proving run completed, new capacity is going to be a very competitive low cost mine and we will maximize the usage of that operation to make sure our best product or best cost product hits the market.","Jim Prokopanko","Matthew, I think you've read that it's a small mine but our Hersey operation we're decommissioning that, so we're taking that out of production. And about a year and a half ago, we announced that we were not going to continue with expansions that we've previously announced. We had an expansion at Belle Plaine that we're ready to go on as well as one at Esterhazy and we've deferred those until we see some change in the cost of production as well as the cost of bringing those capital projects into fruition and the demand scenario. So we've been taking these actions and we started a year and a half ago and we've deferred two major expansion projects. So we have been actively balancing our portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Your line is open.","Mark Gulley - BGC Financial","Good morning. Had a question with respect to the potash cost side? At the Investor Day you talked a little bit about the various cost positions in your plans and indicated that Carlsbad was off of your average cost curve. Can you comment on that part of shutting that facility down is part of your cost reduction plans? Secondly, can you comment on the accretion from the CF acquisition given the strong prospects in Las Vegas?","Jim Prokopanko","Good to have you on the call, Mark. I'm going to have Joc, COO, speak to the potash process at Carlsbad and his operating plan for that.","Joc O'Rourke","So Carlsbad, Mark, let's first of all understand K-Mag is a higher margin, great premium product for us that exclusively comes from our Carlsbad operation. The MLP costs at Carlsbad are higher than our other operations but it's not a significant volume and with the advantage of K-Mag, it's still an important site for us as well as Carlsbad goes to a different market in general and a more localized market or export to Brazil. So either way Carlsbad still makes sense to us. However, we are definitely always looking at how we can reduce those costs, how we can take costs out of that MLP at Carlsbad in particular.","Jim Prokopanko","Thanks, Joc. And Larry Stranghoener, why don't you take the question on the CF accretion.","Larry Stranghoener","Yes, Mark, as Jim mentioned we may be closing on this soon and we're really excited about the timing of this given what's been happening in the phosphate industry, we are pleased that we're going to be getting more tonnes this time in the marketplace. We are busy working on integration planning. That's going very, very well. We see a lot of opportunities on the synergy front and of course the irony is the more successful we are at integrating this business, the more difficult it's going to be to track exactly what the accretion number is. But the numbers we put out at the time we announced the deal of roughly $0.30 per share in 2015 certainly look good to us. We think this is going to prove to be a very successful deal for our shareholders.","Operator","The final question comes from Yonah Wiesz from HSBC. Your line is open.","Yonah Wiesz - HSBC","Hi. Good afternoon. A question to ask you about financials or financial strength. Since you presented your 2013 capital markets day, you've added the CF deal and unless this buyback replaces maybe future buybacks from the MAC Trusts, you're also adding I think $1 billion extra share buyback. And the question I guess is where do you see the source of funds for all these transactions? Is it really just generated internally or would you be significantly increasing your debt to target ratios? Thank you.","Larry Stranghoener","Yonah, it's Larry. Everything that we're talking about doing on the strategic initiative front on the shareholder capital return front is very much in line with what we laid out last year with respect to our capital management philosophy. At that time we talked about a debt to EBITDA target of 1.5 times with the willingness to go to 2 times for a strategic deal such as the CF acquisition. We talked about maintaining a very strong liquidity buffer and we talked about our commitment to investment grade credit ratings. And given the large cash balance we have accumulated given the prospects for the business, we believe that we're able to accomplish all of what we've outlined today within the bounds of those balance sheet targets.","So with that, Jim, I'll turn it over to you for concluding comments.","Jim Prokopanko","Well, I apologize we've run out of time here and we have about five or six more questions in the queue. I've asked those folks to please call Laura and Anton [ph] directly and they'll promptly follow-up with you.","With that, I'll conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. First, market dynamics are unfolding just as we expected they would with sales volumes preceding price improvements. We've seen a big increase in phosphate prices in response to tightening supply and we expect strong demand for potash to lead to improving prices later in the year.","Second, Mosaic has made remarkable strategic progress. We are growing, securing our supply and raw materials, optimizing our business portfolio and creating a much more efficient balance sheet. As a result, Mosaic is in excellent position to thrive as we emerge from this low point in the cycle. Thank you all for joining us today and please have a great day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"14607":["The Mosaic Co.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - Vice President Investor Relations","Thank you and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Joc.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings conversation. This morning, I will discuss current market conditions, and then Rich Mack will review our financials and provide our guidance. Before we take your questions, I will provide closing remarks.","Mosaic delivered solid results in our seasonally slow third quarter despite a variety of market based challenges. There are three points I want you to know. First, demand for our products remains strong in most parts of the world. We understand investor concerns regarding future potash supply and I will address the supply and demand picture for you shortly. Second, Mosaic continues to execute at a very high level and effectively allocate capital. We are focused on capturing the value of our investments. To put it simply, we believe Mosaic is in an excellent position with significant upside when market sentiments and conditions improve. And third, Mosaic has displayed market leadership and a thoughtful production philosophy for many years. We will continue to pursue a strategy to maximize value.","For the quarter Mosaic earned $160 million on net sales of $2.1 billion, compared with earnings of $202 million on net sales of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014. We reported earnings per share of $0.45 this quarter compared to $0.54 a year ago.","Adjusted for notable items, primarily the non-cash impact of foreign exchange rates, Mosaic's earnings increased over 10% to $0.62 per share, compared to $0.56 per share last year. Our higher year-over-year adjusted earnings per share despite tougher markets reflect successful cost control efforts, the lower share count resulting from our active share repurchase activities and a lower effective tax rate.","So let me turn to the markets, which are quite different from country-to-country, and from product-to-product. The one constant around the world however, for both potash and phosphate is that demand remains strong. We expect total global phosphate shipments to set a new record, and total global potash shipments to decline slightly this year compared with last year's record. That is an important point, demand for fertilizer is underpinned by demand for food and we have no doubt that this demand will continue to grow along with world population.","Even if supply outpaces demand for a short period of time, demand will continue its steady upward trajectory. We're seeing this now in the day-to-day operations of farmers all around the world.","Going into each of the last several application seasons, market sentiment has been negative with forecasters expecting significant lower fertilizer applications and each season has exceeded expectations for several reasons.","First, high nutrient removal rates from the recent record global harvests have required growers to replenish their soils. Second, grain and oilseed prices have remained stable. And third, fertilizers remain necessary and affordable.","In addition, challenging macroeconomic factors are not having significant impacts on demand. For example, in Brazil, where the economic and political situation remains volatile, 2015 is expected to be the second best year in history for fertilizer demand.","Demand has also remained strong in other key countries, including China and India. Currency devaluation against the dollar have both positive and negative impacts on agribusiness. A strong dollar is a net positive for agricultural regions like Brazil that are large exporters. Growers can pay for many imports in local currency and sell their grains and oilseeds in dollars.","In North America, the fall application season is meeting our expectations. Potash shipments to North America in 2015 are expected to be lower than last year, mostly because of built up in retail inventories we saw at the end of 2014. Retailers are working through inventories now, and we are seeing evidence that inventories are reaching low levels.","Supply is a different story, and we realize that concerns about future oversupply are driving current equity valuations. We have maintained and we continue to maintain our philosophy to match supply with expected demand, as our decision to curtail production at our Colonsay potash mines demonstrates. It is also worth noting that most of the additional potash supply that is expected to come to market is still years away, so demand will have some time to catch up.","Let's put this into context for Mosaic. We have two attractive businesses that are of similar size, in markets expected to experience long-term secular growth. In Potash, we've taken actions to right-size our operations and reduce cost. We are confident in our ability to manage through, if not take advantage of, the current market dynamics.","In Phosphates, we've also taken out cost and made significant investments that solidify our leadership position. We believe these investments will continue to drive growth in the years to come. The Phosphates business continues to generate attractive margins and demand is strong.","We are ahead of schedule in our work to achieve $500 million in cost savings across the company. And this work is visible on our bottom line. This slide tells the story. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share were higher this year than in 2014, despite lower product prices and overall revenue. Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, capacity enhancements, decisions to exit or curtail underperforming assets, and substantial capital returned to shareholders, are delivering the benefits we anticipated.","While macroeconomic and agricultural market conditions remain challenging, Mosaic remains in an excellent position to continue to reap the benefits of these initiatives, and has significant leverage to the upside when this market turns more positive.","Now I will ask Rich to provide more insights into our results and our guidance for the fourth quarter.","Richard L. Mack - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Joc. I'll begin today with an overview of our three operating segments. The Phosphates segment continued to generate good results and strong margins. Mosaic's Phosphates shipment volumes for the quarter fell slightly below our expectations with delayed Brazilian demand and cautious buying behavior in North America being a big part of the story. As Joc noted, the global phosphate market remains balanced, and the relatively stable margins support that statement. Cost control, including low cash rock mining costs, continues to be a margin driver.","In the Potash segment, our results reflect lower production levels during a seasonally slow demand period when we traditionally take maintenance shutdowns. Having said that, our 20% gross margin rate in this segment reflects excellent cost control. Despite an operating rate of 67%, we produced MOP at a cash cost per tonne of just $105 including $20 per tonne in brine management costs, down 21% from a year ago.","In the International Distribution segment, results were better than expected, especially in light of the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Gross margin per tonne was $30, which is $4 per tonne above the high end of our guidance range. This quarter we sold more tonnes of product than last year at higher than expected margins capturing time-place utility and leveraging our fixed costs.","Now, I'd like to address our capital management. We have repurchased roughly $700 million of Mosaic stock or 15 million shares since the beginning of the year. We repurchased $75 million of our shares during the third quarter in the open market, have over $900 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and will continue to be prudent about our share repurchases in the future.","We will continue to manage capital carefully and embrace a balanced approach in our allocation across growth initiatives both organic and inorganic as well as shareholder distributions. This is a cyclical business, and the most compelling opportunities present themselves at the bottom of the cycle. With that said, our share price in the mid-$30 range creates a high bar for investments other than our own stock.","Now let's move on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. You can clearly see the guidance on the current slide, so unlike prior quarters, I won't go through the details and instead focus on assumptions, risks and opportunities. In Phosphates we anticipate that both the upside and the downside on sales volumes will come from North America, which will represent a higher proportion of expected sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","If you recall, earlier in the year, we diverted tonnes that were destined for North America to the export market, which Mosaic and our size, has the ability to do. As the fall season progresses, our guidance assumes more tonnes will be needed here domestically. We expect relatively stable margins in the fourth quarter as lower realized prices are largely offset by lower raw material costs.","In our International Distribution business, Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume assumptions for the fourth quarter. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne, as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. Finally, swings in the Brazilian reais have an impact on local currency costs. Our forecasted margins do not anticipate any appreciable strengthening in the reais.","In Potash, our volume guidance is below last year's levels because, unlike last year, we do not expect dealers in North America to build inventories late in the year. Similar to Phosphates, albeit to a lesser extent, we expect higher sales volumes domestically compared to the quarter we just finished. These assumptions are incorporated into our pricing guidance.","Margins are expected to be in the mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to hold back production to match market demand. The mechanical failure at our Esterhazy K1 shaft is expected to take three weeks to four weeks to repair, and we have accelerated other work that was originally planned to occur during a maintenance shutdown in December. As a result, we don't expect this event to impact our sales in the fourth quarter or impact our ability to meet expected demand in early 2016.","For the remainder of 2015, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $265 million to $295 million, down from $310 million to $350 million. Brine management costs have also been revised down to the range of $170 million to $180 million from $180 million to $200 million.","Capital expenditures and investments are now expected to range from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Our SG&A expense range is now estimated to be $350 million to $370 million, down from $360 million to $380 million. And our effective tax rate expectations were lowered to be in the mid to high teens range.","Our outlook for 2016 includes the expectation of stability in our markets based on growing demand. Demand for our products is not predicated upon construction of bridges and roads in China, but on the need to eat. We expect demand for our products to grow. The rate of growth will vary from year-to-year, but over time, we are confident in a 2% to 3% average annual growth rate. Our first look at 2016 producer shipments is yet another example of this trend.","The issues we face are not demand driven, as demand in 2016 is expected to be the second highest on record. The concern we hear about, the new supply many investors worry about, is fairly limited until 2017. During the next two years, we expect demand to continue to grow and over a longer period of time we expect demand to consume much of the excess supply.","In the meantime, Mosaic will continue to embrace our operating philosophy of producing only what is needed by our customers.","So, I would like to summarize my comments by reiterating Joc's main point earlier. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have a realistic market outlook and are taking actions to position the company to excel.","With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments. Joc?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rich. Over the past several years, we have experienced a wide array of challenges from the external environments. Agriculture specifically, and commodities in general, are currently facing headwinds from several sources. Mosaic's growth story is driven by the execution of our strategy and reaping the benefits of investments we've made and continue to make. We believe it is a compelling growth story.","At Mosaic, we have worked to optimize our business portfolio, reduce our cost, invested in additional capacity the market will demand, and returned significant capital to shareholders. We have also maintained a strong balance sheet that gives us the ability to take advantage of compelling opportunities that arise at the low part of the cycle. We understand that success in this business requires an operating foundation that will not crack when times are tough, but Mosaic is not just resilient. The moves we have made over the past decade and increasingly during the last two years, have also constructed a powerful engine for growth.","Mosaic is in a great position. We believe we have the strongest combination of talent, assets, financial strength, and global reach in our industry. We intend to use that strength to our advantage, now, and as business and economic conditions improve. We intend to maintain our discipline, build on our leadership and continue to execute at the highest level possible.","In my three months as Mosaic's CEO, I've traveled to meet with a wide range of our stakeholders, customers, shareholders, employees and others in our industry. I've heard a lot of concern about the current markets and the short-term. But I'll say this, I've also seen and heard a lot of reasons to be optimistic, for the industry, and especially for Mosaic. The short-term situation is not as nearly as dire as market sentiment seems to expect and the long-term remains extremely compelling.","Demand for our product will continue to grow and we're managing this company to meet that demand efficiently. And don't forget, Mosaic has many advantages, from our industry-leading premium products portfolio to the earnings leverage our recent strategic moves will provide in better markets, the CF and ADM acquisitions, the Ma'aden joint venture, the decisions we made to exit higher cost businesses and the capital we've returned to shareholders, all provide real opportunities to grow our bottom line. From my perspective we're executing very well and our future looks great.","Now we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","On your production curtailments, could this have an impact on your market share in other phosphates or potash markets, and \u2013 or do you expect similar production curtailments from other producers globally? And then, longer term, how do you think about the economics of curtailments, having lower volumes versus better pricing compared to like a volume over pricing kind of strategy? Thanks.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Andrew. I'm going to start by making a couple of comments, and then I'm going to hand it over to Rick McLellan to talk. But let me talk first about market share. I wouldn't say that Mosaic gets too focused on market share. What we focus on is serving our customers well and optimizing the value from the tonnes that we sell. So I don't like to be characterized as either pushing for market share or pushing for price. I think they're interchangeable in many respects, and you're really pushing for value.","What we have done, as you've seen, is we've looked at what the market needs from our perspective and we've aligned our production to that level. In the short term, that's things like the shutdown of Colonsay for a temporary shutdown. In the long term, it's the permanent moves we've made such as curtailing production of MOP at Carlsbad and selling our Hersey operations. So we've really positioned from a perspective of developing a long-term view of where the market is going to go and serving that market well.","In terms of where we sit next year, I'm just going to leave that for Rick for a second.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Okay. Thanks, Joc. As we look at our planning, we don't just look at the quarters. We look forward at least 18 months, and Joc's done a good job of describing what we do with our customer base, both globally and in North America, and we plan our production to meet their needs. And we do several things to make sure that \u2013 there's a lot of times where people try and shoot ducks when there's none flying or sell into a vacuum. We take the point of we'd rather match up when people are buying to when we're producing, and we've done that so far this year. And as we look forward for 2016, everything we're doing today is on a look of being sure that we can provide our customers the products when they need it and produce it to optimize our returns.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets","Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions on your North American Potash strategy. Joc, can you remind us of the advantages of the consignment strategy that you employ? And do others follow a similar strategy, or is there a potential competitive risk there? And then my second question is, is there a possibility to start securing long-term MOUs with U.S. customers, and if not, why not? Thank you.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So first of all, we do not use a consignment \u2013 sorry. Thanks, Ben. Good to hear you. We don't use a consignment process. What we use is what we call FPD, which is future price deferred. So what we're doing to allow for the efficient logistics, we use customer space for our best customers, we ship to them and then decide on price when the product is actually getting used.","Others may use other strategies, and I really wouldn't talk to their strategies. I believe our strategy is a good balance between making the product available in the market to give us the time-place utility that we need to be efficient while still giving us good economic results. I'll ask Rick to go further.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good morning, Ben. I think part of the question you asked was on MOUs with customers. And I just \u2013 I'll spend a couple of minutes there and then I'll go back and add a couple of points to where Joc \u2013 Joc's points. Right now, we have three-year planning agreements with our top customers. Those aren't contracts, but they are agreements and we build in incentives against those agreements, we build in the portfolio of products we offer. So rather than have formalized MOUs, we have three-year planning agreements with most of our main customers. We think that better reflects a way for us to go to market.","The second piece is \u2013 and Joc talked about, you asked whether it put us at a competitive disadvantage versus other programs like price protection that are being offered out there. Frankly, with the customers we work with, what we recognize in a quarter is what we've revenue recognized, not what we've shipped and billed at provisional prices. And we think that's a much better way for us to operate a business and our customers to make sure they take advantage of the use of their space.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Good morning, guys. I want to stay in North America so, looking at your guidance for 2016, your numbers for 2015, potash demand will be down 3 million tonnes this year and you've lost about 1 million tonnes of share, all in North America, your Canpotex partner, PotashCorp is about flat. So my question is who else lost market share in 2015? You guys took a big hit of it. Why was that the right strategy? And looking to 2016, do you see gaining 3 million tonnes back in the global market. Do you think you'll be able to gain back that 1 million tonnes and where will those 3 million tonnes come from? Thanks.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Again, this will be another one I'm going to put over to \u2013 sorry, hi, Joel, good to hear you. I'll put this back to Rick as well. I think there's a couple things I want to point out before I give it to Rick though, and the first is we saw this in the first half of the year where in the slower part, first quarter it appeared that our market share was behind. And I think that's got something to do with how we revenue rec as opposed to our competitors. And then, in the second quarter what we found is that that was basically made up. We expect we'll see similar things in this year, so in the second half of the year.","So ultimately, I don't think it's quite legitimate to look at quarter-by-quarter market shares. I think they vary, and again, we've got long term plans with our customers. And as long we're meeting those long-term plans with our customers, we expect that we'll do fine.","And I guess the other aspect is where are those imports would be the other aspect of market that we have to look at. And frankly, the imports are playing a bit of a disruptive role, and we'll have to look at how we manage that in the next year. We'll be pushing that out.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","And Joel, I think Joc's done a good job of it. You need to separate revenue recognized sales from shipments. And that's where things will get corrected in the fourth quarter.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","And can I ask Mike Rahm just to give us a view on where the 2016 mark is going for potash? I think that's also important here.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Sure. Yeah. We're projecting a point estimate of about 62 million tonnes, and that's up roughly 3 million tonnes from our 59.1 million point estimate. And I guess I would characterize the growth as not getting a grand slam from anyone, but just very consistent singles from all of the major buyers.","I think we've laid out in terms of the big five importers, China, India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brazil, we expect moderate increases in all of those. And I think that really has tied into our view of Ag commodity prices. We see a very balanced global agricultural outlook. We think acreage and the technology applied to crops will need to continue to increase and underpin decent demand prospects.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jacob Bout from CIBC. Your line is open.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Had a question here on Esterhazy, and maybe talk a bit about some of the operational issues you have there. It sounds like you have some problems with the skip there. And maybe you can talk also as well a bit on K3, how that is working, what do you have left to spend, and does it make sense at this point to either speed that up or, the development of that, or to slow it down?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jacob. Okay. I'm going to hand over the details of the Esterhazy skip to Walt Precourt, who's on the call here today. But before I do, again, I'll say, as Rich said in his comments, this is a \u2013 we had a failure of a skip in \u2013 a mechanical failure of the skip at Esterhazy's K1. We have accelerated some maintenance work, and we were looking at lower production rates to make sure our inventories were in line anyway. So we don't see any impact to speak of either in this quarter or in the first quarter of next year. So that's the first point.","In terms of K3 spend, I just want to say today we are pushing K3 at the reasonable safe rate we can. You have to realize, we're sinking shaft and you only have approximately 20 feet of working area, 20 feet of diameter, and we're sinking that shaft. So there's very little opportunity to accelerate at this stage beyond that. But once we get into K3, we'll certainly be accelerating the development. So with that, I'm going to ask Walt to just talk a little bit more about the skip mechanical failure.","Walter F. Precourt - Senior Vice President-Potash Operations","Hi, Jacob. So as you pointed out, we did have a mechanical issue with one of the Esterhazy K1 skips last week. And although the skip itself was damaged, there was minimal infrastructure damage, so we're very confident that we'll resume full K1 production later this month. And we do expect that the repair cost will really be de minimis.","In terms of your question with respect to K3, we have about US$1.7 billion left to spend on that entire project.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Sorry. So I guess my question on Phosphates, and hoping to get a little bit of color on some of the uncertainty you have about the North American market in the fourth quarter, and generally as you think about 2016, provide some high level comments on different demand outlooks, India in particular, an area that seems to be a bit of a wild card today. Thank you.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'm just going to hand that straight to Mike Rahm to talk about the markets, and then Rick to add color.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","In terms of fourth quarter shipments in North America, I think we've been pleasantly surprised and pleased with the anecdotal reports that we're getting in from the field that the fall application season has met or exceeded expectations. And obviously, that's not a shocker in the sense that we've had a great crop come off, so lots of nutrients have been removed. We've had a fairly long open application window to get fertilizer down. So we think a fair number of tonnes of P and K are going down this fall. Then I guess while you're talking about phosphate, I think what's really important on the potash side of things, we think we're working down the increase in channel inventories that we saw last year.","Shifting to 2016, you've seen our projections. For phosphate, we expect that shipments will increase from about 65.5 million tonnes this year to a range of 66 million tonnes to 68 million tonnes and our point estimate is right smack dab in the middle of that at 66.9 million tonnes.","And in terms of some of the markets, yeah, we do expect a decent rebound, particularly in those markets that saw a little bit of a channel build last year, Brazil. We see continued growth in India. We think over the past several years, their channel has been pulled down to very low levels, and we're talking about the channel primarily at the small retail shop, the tens of thousands of shops across India that have 30, 40 bags in the back storage room. So we think that has been drawn down, and they're going to buy the amount that they actually use as opposed to rely on inventory.","And I guess similar to the comment we made earlier, I think we see lots of singles in 2016 as opposed to a grand slam or strikeouts in some of these markets. And as a consequence, the growth that we're projecting is made up of moderate increases in most of the main markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sandy Klugman from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.","Sandy Klugman - Vertical Research Partners","Good morning. A question on industry supply discipline. We've definitely been seeing signs of it in the potash industry, but what are your expectations for how competitors in the phosphate industry will manage production? In particular, I'm thinking about levels out of China and how you expect OCP to manage supply given the increases to their granulation capacity?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, I'm going to start off. Thank you, Sandy. I'm going to start off just a couple of comments, and then again hand it to Mike to give a bit of a world S and D discussion. But what I would say on phosphates though, certainly, China has continued to increase their exports, probably beyond what either we or some of the major analysis firms like CRU would have expected. But having said that, the demand has required it.","I believe China has increased their exports by about 1.6 million tonnes, and India has taken up all that as excess for there. So that's the first step of it. If I look forward going in P, we don't see a huge amount of new production coming on for the next year or two, and yet the market continues to grow at 1.5 million or so tonnes per year. So we continue to see that market as very constructive and a very good market to be in.","Mike, can you give more color?","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","Sure. Just \u2013 let me just start by talking about China. Joc mentioned those numbers, and I think those are from July or August. I took a look at numbers this morning. When you look at year-to-date exports from China, they're up 3.3 million tonnes, and we think for the year, China will probably export somewhere in that 9.5 million to 10 million tonne mark.","And while that's a big increase, as Joc mentioned, the market really is requiring that. And in particular, if you look at India and their increase in DAP imports, those have increased 3.1 million tonnes during the same period, so \u2013 and particularly, if you look at China's phosphate exports and look at just the DAP component, DAP exports have increased 2.7 million tonnes, Indian DAP imports have increased 3.1 million tonnes. So there is a draw coming from India that China is meeting.","The other thing I think that we've said before is that on the demand side, we see very steady growth in phosphate demand. And on the supply side, there are really some very interesting dynamics taking place. While China has increased their exports, if you look at other major producers, there have been some real significant declines in supply.","So, in North America, we've had two facilities close down, so we've had the full impact of the closure of Mississippi Phosphates this year, so another 700,000 tonnes lost there. We've had the \u2013 a full-year impact of the White Springs plant closing. And then if you look around the world, there have been outages or hiccups in many different countries, whether it's Tunisia with some of the political unrest there that has disrupted production, whether it's in \u2013 just some hiccups in places like Jordan, South Africa, Senegal, Mexico, you name it. There have been supply disruptions. And then, in terms of the bigger players like Ma'aden, Ma'aden I, continues to ramp up. It still hasn't reached full capacity. So it's sort of leveled off at two-thirds of capacity, if you will. And the Moroccans are bringing on capacity but at a much slower rate than expected. Whether that's planned or unplanned, who knows. But the bottom line is, their first hub just started up a few months ago. And as we understand, the granulation plant is not running there yet.","And secondly, if you look at some of the other hubs, they're not scheduled to come on for several months or even years. And I think all of that is evident when you look at margins. In this business, we're focused on what we call the stripping margin.","And the difference between the price of DAP and the price of sulfur and ammonia in a tonne of DAP \u2013 and if you look at that, margins in the fourth quarter, and if you calculate them based on current spot prices that are published, they're up about $40 from a year ago. And if you look at margins throughout calendar year 2015, they have been incredibly constant at between about $265 and $275 per tonne. So I think the best proof in terms of the positive or constructive phosphate fundamentals is in what stripping margins have done and they've reflected the stronger fundamentals in phosphate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Byrne from BoA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. When you look at heterogeneity of P and K nutrient levels within North American cultivated fields. How do you look at the potential impact of variable rate fertilizer applications of P and K on demand? Do you think that there could be a net increase in demand or net reduction in demand as growers focus more on that heterogeneity?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to hand that over to Mike right away, but I'm going to first just say that, look, we see technical advances like variable rate application and precision agriculture as ultimately a very good thing. We believe the demand for our fertilizer in the plant is all about \u2013 if you get too technical, about the sociometric needs of the plant and the fertility of the soil. So if we can have that fertility of the soil be more exact, then we believe overall, it will neither hurt nor help our overall consumption but will ensure the best productivity for the farmer.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","And I think that's the only comment I would have, if you look at the numbers, shipments in North America of both the main phosphate and potash products have really been pretty consistent over time in big round numbers. About 9 million metric tonnes of MOP and about 9 million metric tonnes of the main solid phosphate fertilizers get shipped every year. And there might be some swings from year-to-year in the pipeline and so forth, but on average, that's more or less what goes down.","So, I think that the widespread use of variable rate technologies, which have been around now for 10 years, 15 years, I think have been to optimize that on farm fields. So, I think more of it gets spread on the better land that has upside in terms of yield potential, less probably gets spread on the sandy hillsides. But the bottom-line is net-net, shipments have remained about the same.","Rick, do you have any comments?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","The only thing I would add is that this technology, the variable rate technology has been around for a while. And frankly, it has been helpful to getting the right nutrients in the right place for the growing crop. And we see, as the adoption rates get higher going forward, that being very positive for both P and K application rates overall across North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes, I want to go to your slide 12 where you talk about your potash shipment outlook. You've got an increase in 2016 to 61 million to 63 million tonnes from 59 million this year. What's your price assumption there? Are we finally seeing some price elasticity benefit from lower potash prices, I mean, you're down about $100 domestically and presumably you're forecasting lower offshore pricing next year as well. So I'm just wondering if you can comment on the price elasticity dynamic and the impact on demand?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","So I'm going to hand it to Mike in a second, but on the price elasticity, I think we've probably been a bit surprised that there is more elasticity than we might have expected. And in terms of price, I think it's a little early to come up with an exact price for next year. But I would say, first of all, the potash oversupply concerns, I believe are a bit overblown. I mean, this year, we started with high inventory. As the shipments go up next year, we start with a little lower inventory. I believe that market is going to be a lot better balanced and I don't believe the downward pressure people are talking about will really be there.","So I'm going to let Mike give a little more of the detail of that and how we came up with our forecast. But I think it is a good story.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","And in terms of the underlying price assumptions there, Don, I think we're beginning to see some stabilization in potash prices. They have come down a great deal, and our expectation is that they will stabilize. And I guess how they play out in 2016 will depend on a lot of factors, I think the most important of which is agricultural commodity prices.","And I guess the reason why we see prices stabilizing here is that we are working through those large channel inventories from last year. As you see in the numbers, gosh, we had a 9 million tonne increase in shipments. And I think, you're probably familiar with all the reasons for that, but when you go back and take a look at what was happening in 2014, we ended 2013 with virtually an empty pipeline, given the announcement on July 30, 2013. Everyone was waiting for prices to move where advertised. And eventually, people stopped buying, and the pipeline was pulled down.","Then we got into 2014 with all of the weather and shipment concerns in North America. Prices began to increase, and everyone jumped back into the market. Net result, big increase in channel inventories, especially in North America, Brazil, and even Indonesia and Malaysia. We're working through those right now. So, I think we'll start 2016 with the pipeline in much better shape than certainly a year ago.","And then in addition to that, I think \u2013 we've been saying what has really pressured potash prices this year are two factors: one, being the channel inventories; the second, being the collapse of key potash currencies. And hopefully in 2016, we'll see a little bit greater stability on the macroeconomic front, and we think that will be constructive. And then, if these forecasts are on target, we should see about a 3 million tonne rebound, we think, in shipments. Put that all together, and I think it points to a situation where prices begin to stabilize a bit and we see a very balanced situation between what's required to ship and the actual demand out there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. I think I have a question for Rich Mack. The operating cash flow through the nine months has been $1.5 billion this year versus $1.8 billion last year, and the cash flow from operating activities this quarter was only $184 million, even though D&A plus net income is about $340 million. What's going on with your working capital that's leading to such a large cash drain? And how do you see your operating cash flow for the year versus last year or your free cash flow for the year versus last year, this year?","Richard L. Mack - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Jeff. Well, for the year, we don't expect any difference really between our performance in operating cash flow this year compared to last. For the quarter, we had some just movement in working capital when you compare it to last year. We had some strong trends in working capital movements when you compare it to this year.","But in the end, our operating cash flow performance for the nine months is very strong for Mosaic, and we continue to be a cash generator in both of our businesses. And I think that's going to be part of our story going forward in terms of continuing strong operating cash flow, a reduction in our capital expenditure profile over time, and an increasing free cash flow story.","Operator","Your next question comes from Yonah Weisz from HSBC. Your line is open.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)","Yes. Hello. Good morning. A question for Joc. In your comments at the start of this call, you talked about Mosaic's balance sheet and ability to use the balance sheet, thinking about new opportunities at the low point in the cycle. Earlier on this year at Mosaic's Investor Day, your predecessor, Jim, was asked I think a similar question about use of balance sheet and perhaps M&A, and he implied that really no chance for M&A in potash and maybe here or there a few bolt-on acquisitions in phosphates.","On other hand, if you're talking about use of balance sheet, I'm wondering is there a change in philosophy at Mosaic with regards to M&A? And if so, could you talk a bit about what you'd be interested in? Thank you very much.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Look, our capital philosophy, Yonah, has not changed in the last year. We're certainly looking first at making sure we maintain a reasonable liquidity buffer, that we keep our credit rating in really good shape, that we meet our debt ratios that we have set, the 1.5 times to 2 times EBITDA to debt. So none of that has changed. And as we've probably said, at the bottom of cycles, that really opens up, let's say, more opportunities. There's more things out there that look like they might be well-priced for the people who have the balance sheet to take advantage of it.","But as Rich said in his comments, I would emphasize that when we trade \u2013 when our stock is trading low like this, our bar becomes even higher because we have to measure any expenditure against the benefit of buying back our own shares. So we've been very disciplined about that, and we will continue to be very disciplined about it.","But if there is a great opportunity for our shareholders, we're going to explore it carefully. And if it makes sense and adds value long term, we will certainly be looking at that. In terms of specifics, we don't like to talk about specifics. But be known that the general philosophy has not changed, the discipline has not changed, but our opportunities may be higher.","Operator","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","It's Dan Jester on for P.J. If you look at realized prices for potash over time, it seems like the premium in the North America market maybe has come in (50:20) a bit compared to the rest of the world. So I'm just wondering if structurally the North American market is going to get more competitive from here?","And if I can sneak a second one in, maybe, Mike, can you just comment about the longer-term ability of Chinese phosphate exports to be maintained at this high level? Thanks.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Dan. I'm going to hand this over to Mike pretty quick. But I'll say, look, we live in a competitive market. And from time to time, if the competition is higher, those \u2013 if you call it a premium, they're all about, again, time-place, utility, cost to serve that market. And so, from time-to- time, that premium, as you call it, will change based on free market dynamics.","I think the structural reasons for a higher price in North America, being it's a granular market, being that there is some logistics challenges to get into the mid-U.S., justify the difference in price. But that won't always be there day-to-day. And so with that, I'm going to hand it to Mike to give some...","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Sure.","Michael Rahm - VP-Market Analysis & Strategic Planning","And I think \u2013 Hi, P.J. or P.J.'s substitute here. I think we've said in the past, I mean, the fair comparison is looking at the blend grade price delivered to the U.S. Gulf as well as Brazil. And if you look at current spot prices, you're exactly right that that differential has more or less dissipated. In particular, if you look at a NOLA barge price of $270 per short tonne versus a Brazil C&F price of roughly $290. For the Russian or Belarusian supplier, Brazil actually gives them a little bit better netback.","So, I would say that, yes, we've seen some adjustments in that \u2013 in prices to sort of turn off the beacon in terms of attracting tonnes to North America. And I think that's certainly evident in terms of our price \u2013 our import forecast. If you look at the 2014-2015 fertilizer year, the U.S. imported about 1.7 million metric tonnes of MOP from offshore sources. And not only Russians, but every potash producer around the globe seemed to place a few tonnes in the U.S. We think that's going to drop about 600,000 tonnes to 1.1 million, 1.0 million tonnes this year.","And one of the main reasons for that is the dissipation of that differential. And if you look at the numbers for the first three months of our fertilizer year, namely the third calendar quarter, imports are down about 150,000 tonnes from last year. So we're on a pace to reduce imports from offshore sources by the amount that we have. And then, again, if global shipments increase 3 million tonnes, there's going to be kind of a natural pull of some of these tonnes that have come into North America into other markets that are better markets for them.","And then your second question in terms of long-term Chinese exports: obviously, we've seen a big surge this year, driven largely by the rebound in Indian demand as well as the supply problems that we talked about earlier. I think longer term, we expect that those are not going to be in that 10 million tonne range, but probably something closer to 6 million, 7 million tonnes.","We think there will be structural adjustments that take place in the Chinese phosphate industry. Chinese producers are very heterogeneous in the sense that there are some very efficient low-cost players, there are some medium-cost players, and there are some high-cost players. So we think that they will see some restructuring, and that longer term 10 million tonnes is not the number.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Neel Kumar - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. This is Neel Kumar calling in for Vincent. I just wanted to talk a little bit about what's going on in India and China on potash. We've been reading about Indian buyers looking for a contract discount. Do you see that as a possibility? And in regards to China, how has the reimplementation of VAT affected domestic consumption?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sorry, Neel. I missed the second part of your question. It broke up a little bit. Oh, the VAT. Okay. I think I got it. It sounds like somebody's got that. Okay. Well, I'm going to hand that straight over to Rick to answer. I think that's probably right up his alley. So Rick, why don't you just take that?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good morning, Neel. If you are asking about the Indian and Chinese contracts, frankly it's a bit too early to talk about those, but we do see good demand. If you look overall, we've seen increased demand or solid demand, 14 million tonnes in China for product. So the product that is being shipped is going to the ground.","And indications on the impact of VAT have been frankly de minimis from what we've been able to pick up. They have to work through inventory. There was a transitional VAT cost for inventory. And so, overall, we think it'll take a little bit of time to work through. But where potash is priced versus other nutrients, there's high inclusion rates on \u2013 in NPKs for potash.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","And, Rick, can I just add one thing? If you look at grain prices in China, I mean, the government supports them at extraordinarily high levels. There had been a lot of, I think, focus on their September 18 announcement that they were going to reduce the corn support price by 10%. They've reduced it to RMB 2,000 per metric tonne. That's the equivalent of about $8.70 per bushel.","So their support price is still more than double what current prices are. So in terms of a 13% VAT, while it certainly increases the pain for the Chinese farmers to buy phosphate and other fertilizers, the farm economics there are very good, and we really don't see that denting demand all that much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. And congratulations on starting out on such a nice note. Good first quarter, say, for a new CEO.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jonas.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Pleasure. Question, I think it's been asked but I want to phrase a little bit differently, when you're thinking about Colonsay what would the world look like for you to restart it, when will you restart it?","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. So, thank you, Jonas, and again, thank you for the comment. But just before I do this, I think this will be probably our \u2013 either our last or second to last question as we get to the end of the hour but \u2013 so Colonsay, look, what we will be looking at is I have to take a step back. We have a very comprehensive process for doing what we call integrated business planning. And that integrated business planning looks at our production capabilities, it looks at where we make the product, what product we're making, so it's done on a site-by-site basis for production. It's done on a product-by-product basis for production. We also look at the markets that we're serving and how those look on the quarter all the way out to multi-year.","So with both of those \u2013 and then you have the logistics in between but that very comprehensive process we take a look at how we're going to add the next \u2013 the most value over the next period of time. Now clearly, if the market requires it and we see it as adding real value to our shareholders, we will add production. But as Rick said earlier today on one of the earlier questions, there is very little value in selling into a market when there's no demand. And in the third quarter, it's just refilling, it's just getting ready for the fall application season. So what we find in general is if you try and stuff product into that market, all you do is destroy price and value. So we would rather wait until there really is the demand out there.","James O'Rourke - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, I think it's probably \u2013 as we are at the hour, it's time for a wrap up. And all I'm going to say in the wrap up is, look, we see the future long-term as extremely bright. We do believe in the food story. We believe in the secular long-term trend of higher population, greater wealth around the world leading to higher demand for food which leads to higher demand for our product.","And with that, I think Mosaic is extremely well-positioned to take advantage of that, and we will continue to focus on operational excellence, on delivering to our customers, and making sure we execute against our strategy.","So thank you very much for listening, and we'll hear from you again in a quarter.

Second, positive fundamentals should take root this year and overtake cautious sentiment. We expect to see volumes increase, followed by stronger pricing. And third, our exceptionally strong balance sheet gives us important flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. All these factors, combined with the ever-growing global demand for food, give us great confidence in Mosaic's future.","First, I'll quickly review the numbers. We reported operating earnings of $560 million on revenue of $2.5 billion for the quarter. Potash business unit contributed $316 million in operating earnings, and the Phosphates business generated $245 million in operating earnings. In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.47, which includes the tax items we reported in November. Assuming a normalized tax rate of 23.3%, our earnings per share were $0.99. Finally, we generated $322 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and we continue to maintain a very strong cash position with $3.4 billion of cash on hand.","Beyond the quarter's numbers, agricultural fundamentals are exceptionally strong around the globe, and that bodes well for Mosaic over the long term. Despite the severe drought in the U.S. and weather problems in other parts of the world, this year's global harvest was the second-largest ever. Even so, the world will consume more grains and oilseeds than it harvests this year. Food supply is precarious, and farmers are well aware of this fact. So it should come as no surprise that futures markets are signaling farmers to expand planted area and increase fertilizer applications to boost yield in 2013.","In fact, 2013 new crop prices for corn, soybeans and hard red winter wheat have traded at the highest prices ever for the last several months. These record new crop prices support our forecast that U.S. farmers could plant 96 million acres of corn next spring, and the Brazilian farmers could apply a record 31 million tonnes of plant nutrients this year.","Just as important, farmers have the cash they need to invest in their businesses. The USDA estimates that U.S. net farm cash income surged to a record high in 2012 and forecast similar levels this year. Put succinctly, farmers do not want to get caught with a short crop in the current macro environment, so they're going to do everything they can to bring maximum yield out of every acre of land.","We've seen evidence of this imperative this fall in North America as the nutrient application season brought the highest levels of demand for our products since Mosaic was formed. Farmers are undeterred by the challenging 2012 harvest. They have those high grain and oilseed prices clearly in focus. Though the outlook remains strongly positive, but the short term continues to present some uncertainties for our business. I'd like to enumerate those and give you our perspective on how we expect them to resolve and how we're managing through them. In essence, we view all these issues primarily as timing challenges.","Let's start with China, which delayed signing a new contract for Canadian potash until this week. In the meantime, China met some of its farmers' demand with domestic production in rail shipments from Eastern Europe. But a diversity of suppliers is necessary to meet all Chinese potash demand as the newly-signed Canpotex contract makes clear.","While we obviously would have liked the higher price, the 1 million tonnes to be shipped to China in the first half of this year indicates very strong demand. And just as important, the contract provides a base load to get the global potash market functioning smoothly again. Customers around the globe waited to learn the price at which the China contract settled before committing to major purchases. Now that the price is known, we expect pent-up demand from other nations to emerge. I'll comment further on the potash market shortly.","Second, the story is quite different in India, which continues to struggle with its subsidy policies and currency valuations. Here too we believe the issue was one of timing. India cannot continue to sacrifice food security and its environment by continuing its market-distorting subsidies, which lead to imbalances in crop nutrition. As such, we believe India will return to the potash market this year.","Finally, Mississippi River. No doubt you've heard and have seen the media's increasing attention to the river, and that attention is well justified. The water level in St. Louis has dropped below 9 feet for the first time since the Army Corps of Engineers began keeping records. That's 20 feet below normal. If river levels do not rise, we and the rest of the industries that rely on America's most important passage for commerce will face challenges.","Based on our estimates, 2\/3 of the urea, 1\/2 of the Phosphates and 1\/4 of the Potash that reach North American farms travel on the Mississippi. So the possibility of a closed or severely-restricted river could mean that farms will not be able to get all the nutrients they need for timely spring application.","The river issue could begin impacting our results in the fourth fiscal quarter. Customers could begin buying sooner with the intention of filling their sheds in advance of a major shipping slowdown, and importers would struggle to get their products into the U.S. In response, phosphate prices could rise and benefit producers who have been able to move that product to warehouses in advance of spring. We have been working to do just that.","To summarize these challenges, in countries where markets are working freely, agricultural fundamentals and demand for our products are extremely strong. With the China potash contract now resolved, we believe demand will accelerate to reflect the strong agricultural fundamentals.","On the next slide, you'll see some evidence to support our optimistic outlook. In 2006, global potash demand declined by 3.3 million tonnes and pricing softened. In the following year, potash demand came back with such force, increasing over 7 million tonnes, that producers struggled to keep up. While our expectations are for a similar rebound in demand, our current forecasts are much more modest than in 2006, 2007.","Now I would like to dig a little deeper into our Potash operations. We slowed production toward the end of calendar 2012 to better align with supply-demand dynamics. While our operating rates remain relatively high in the second quarter to meet strong North American demand for granular potash, we extended our holiday shutdowns, and our operating rate for the third quarter will remain below optimal levels.","Even as Chinese demand returns, India remains on the sidelines. So we have revisited our forecast for global potash shipments in 2013. We expect producers to ship 55 million to 57 million tonnes, which will be close to the record levels of 2011. Our view is long term, and the horizon looks bright for potash. Even though the new capacity coming online from Mosaic and others could cause a dip in short-term operating rates, we expect average operating rates in our mines to remain high over the coming years.","We are continuing with our expansion projects in Saskatchewan because the world's farmers are going to need more potash in the decades ahead. Keep in mind that our 3 million tonnes of approved expansions are all brownfields, which are currently the only kind of expansions that make economic sense with potash prices where they are today. Our remaining 2 million tonnes of proposed projects will be evaluated over the next year.","One final note on potash. Demand for our premium products, Pegasus and K-Mag, is exceeding our production capacity, and we are earning premium prices for those products. Farmers are realizing the value these and other innovative Mosaic products provide.","By contrast, phosphate market seems to have found a balance after a volatile beginning in December. The market is really a tale of 2 hemispheres. We're experiencing record shipments to the Western Hemisphere and significantly softer conditions in the East. We continue to expect phosphate shipments to reach another record and to extend their steady growth trend. However, we have lowered our estimates for 2012 and our forecast for 2013 due mainly to larger-than-expected declines in India.","We continue to make progress towards a potential new ammonia plant. Last month, we were with the governor of Louisiana to announce that the state has granted us significant incentives that will weigh in to our final decision, and we are now focused on front-end engineering and design work at our Faustina, Louisiana location. That work will take about 8 months, and we expect to make a final decision on the full capital commitment this summer.","MicroEssentials, our premium micronutrient phosphate fertilizer, continues to deliver excellent performance. Farmers, particularly in North America, are rapidly learning that the minor additional premium product cost leads to significant gains in yield. In fact, MicroEssentials now represents more than 10% of all phosphates applied to North American fields and almost 6% of Brazilian phosphate applications.","Overall, even as we enter the seasonally slowest period of our year, we feel good about the performance of our 2 business units in the face of some difficult challenges, and we feel very good about the longer-term prospects for both Potash and Phosphates.","Before I leave this discussion of our operations, I'd like to highlight our safety performance. The relentless pursuit of an injury-free workplace is our first priority, as well as an indicator of our operational excellence, and we are making good progress. Through the first half of fiscal 2013, our safety performance continued to track better than last year's record-setting performance with a 13% reduction in our recordable injury rate and a 29% decline in lost-time accidents compared with the first half of 2012.","With that, I'll ask Larry to talk through our thoughts on capital allocation and provide our guidance. After that, I'll conclude with some further thoughts on our outlook. Larry?","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As Jim noted, this quarter's results are in line with our expectations. So rather than spending your time rehashing our numbers, I'd like to address a couple of topics that I know are on your minds.","First, our capital allocation philosophy. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and that, combined with our expectation of strong future operating cash flows, gives us significant flexibility. We have the cash and the debt capacity necessary to pursue all 3 of our capital management priorities, which are to invest for organic business growth, to act on appropriate strategic investment opportunities and to return capital to shareholders.","We are constantly evaluating investment opportunities, and we're maintaining our discipline as we do so. We will only commit capital when it makes strategic and financial sense for Mosaic and our shareholders.","Regarding shareholder distributions, you all know that there are outstanding shares that could begin coming to market this summer, and we are committed to managing these lock-up expirations in an orderly fashion. Our financial flexibility gives us the ability to consider a wide range of options, including the possible repurchase of some or all of those shares. We look forward to initiating discussions at the end of May when we're allowed to do so.","Now I'll turn to our guidance. Our third fiscal quarter is usually our seasonally slowest with periods of limited transactions and price transparency. We expect third quarter Potash volumes to be in the range of 1.5 million to 1.8 million tonnes, which is substantially higher than last year's third quarter.","We expect average Potash pricing to be in the range of $370 to $400 per tonne, which is down for 3 primary reasons: generally lower market prices; our seasonal shift to greater shipments of standard potash, which is more prevalent outside North America; and our increasing Canpotex share, which means even more of our product is expected to be delivered to international markets.","Potash operating rates are expected to remain suboptimal, including the extended holiday shutdowns we've already taken. Lower operating rates and expected lower prices will continue to pressure the Potash gross margin rate in the third quarter.","In Phosphates, fiscal third quarter sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 2.5 million to 2.8 million tonnes. The balanced current market conditions are likely to continue, and so we expect prices to be in the range of $485 to $515 per tonne.","Operating rates and our gross margin rate should be essentially flat with those in the second quarter. Finally, our cost for brine management at Esterhazy were down slightly during the second quarter, but our run rate remains above our previous guidance. We now expect our full year brine management cost to be in the range of $245 million to $275 million.","One final note. In case you missed our news release a couple of weeks ago, we are going to transition from our current fiscal year to calendar year reporting. We will complete fiscal 2013 in May, and then we'll enter a 7-month stub period through December 31. The first full calendar reporting year will be 2014. In September of this year, we plan to provide you with new historical financials for calendar quarters back to January 1, 2012. We are making this change to better align our business seasonality with our reporting and to align our reporting with that of our peers.","Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James T. Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. Global agriculture experienced quite a rollercoaster ride in 2012. Spring planting in North America created expectations of a record crop and low grain and oilseed prices. Then our planet dried out -- from the U.S. breadbasket to South America and the Black Sea. Those once promising crops wilted and shrunk. Grain and oilseed prices rallied and then rallied further. The economics of farming rallied right along with them, and farmers across the globe are enjoying nearly unprecedented prosperity.","But the same cannot be said of the world's food security. I know you've heard me talk about food many times before, and I'm sure some of you are quite tired of hearing of it. But I'll keep talking about it. All of us at Mosaic, all committed to our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs. We'll keep talking about it because food is the Mosaic story, and because the global food story is why investors should see great opportunity in Mosaic.","Farm land is barely increasing. But even if farm land could increase at the same rate as the world's population, demand for food would still surpass agricultural production. Growing human prosperity brings with it demand for higher-quality foods, most notably proteins, which, in turn, require more grain.","So over the next 4 decades, with no appreciable increase in farm land, the world will have 2 billion more mouths to feed, 1\/2 of whom will live in Africa, the only continent that is not yet self-sufficient in food production. And more of our planet's 9 billion residents will demand more protein. It's a daunting, literally life and death challenge. With farm prosperity running high, there is hope that enough capital will find its way to agriculture to nurture the innovative thinking necessary to meet mushrooming demand.","Whether that investment materializes or not, the fact remains that farmers will have strong incentive to coax maximum yield from their land, and they simply cannot do that without good crop nutrition. That is Mosaic's promise. We're the crop nutrition experts, and we have the global reach to make an important contribution to global food security, which is one of the defining challenges of our time. That, in turn, bodes very well for our shareholders. So I will continue to revisit this topic frequently. It's why we're here, and it's why we're so bullish on Mosaic's future.","Now we'd be happy to take your questions. Over to you, operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can I just ask -- Larry, you laid out the capital priorities, and I think sort of the -- what I get when I'm out talking to investors now, is the ones that know your story well I think understand how to sort of divide up your liquidity around those 3 priorities. But maybe for the third person that's newer to the story, if you have $3.5 billion of cash more or less, and I think the number is about $6.5 billion of debt capacity to stay investment grade, which you listed as a priority, how much organic growth in dollars do you already have laid out to spend? If you went ahead with the ammonia plant, we know roughly what that would cost, but when would you spend that -- the bulk of that money? Would it be next year? Would it be 3 years from now? And then on strategic investment, they haven't really done much other than -- you've made some divestments and so forth, but how much is there really out there to do because I think, ultimately, it nets down to what should investors expect you to be capable of doing from a return to shareholders perspective, both as it relates to potential dividend increases and ultimately, how much stock you could buy back both from the charitable trust and the family members who've you've, of course, can't talk to you right now and then ultimately from the open market?","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Vincent, thank you for the question. That's -- there's a lot to respond to there. I'll repeat what we said in our comments. We have a lot of financial flexibility, and we have very deliberately built up this financial flexibility to deal with the expiration of our tax restrictions and the coming lockup expirations. We want to be able to deal with that situation in whatever way makes sense at the time. It's a little bit situational, it's a little bit hypothetical. We don't know what we're going to be dealing with next summer when those lockup expirations expire. We don't know what those shareholders are going to be thinking with respect to what they want to do with their shares. And so it's difficult for us to be as precise as you all would like us to be. Suffice it to say that we expect to be able to continue to fund our organic growth initiatives through operating cash flow and beyond that, we believe we've got extensive capability to pursue strategic alternatives if and when they arise. And as you point out, we have not seen anything yet that we've seen fit to invest in other than the Miski Mayo Mine. So we continue to exercise great discipline and to return cash to shareholders. I would note that when we've had the opportunity to buy back shares, we have done so. You'll recall that when we did that early last year, we said at the time that was the single best investment opportunity we could find. We would continue to view share repurchase in that light comparing it to other investment alternatives when that time comes. So we're asking for continued patience. We don't have full flexibility yet. We understand that come May, come this summer, that investors are going to be looking for more detail about how we intend to deploy our capital. But accept the fact that until we get to May, until we can start engaging with these shareholders whose lockup -- where the lockups will expire, we can't be more definitive than that at this point in time.","James T. Prokopanko","Vincent, it's Jim Prokopanko. I'll just add an element to Larry's comments in regards to your question about strategic that -- how much is there, you really haven't seen anything. And one, I think that's a testament to Mosaic's discipline about how we look at investments. We're not impatient to make a move. We do have a lot of dry powder, but we're not going to blow a hole on our foot just because we have that. There aren't -- we are a natural party to be involved in any kind of acquisitions. There's not many that would do anything without talking to Mosaic first. So I don't feel at all that there's -- that we're going to miss anything here. So just stay tuned. We're being disciplined. We're being very prudent and stay tuned.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Christopher Perrella","It's Chris Perrella on for Kevin. Could you just elaborate, with the India contract timing, would that be held up by the need to -- for more clarity on their subsidy regime for next year? And what's your thoughts, Jim, on going to more of a spot market for China and India?","James T. Prokopanko","Going to have Rick and possibly Mike Rahm, Dr. Mike Rahm respond to the India, and then I'll add some comments about spot pricing.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, on India, the contract timing is going to be driven by primarily one thing, and that is inventories have been drawn down in-country to some very low levels. And so we expect something to get done in the first quarter for Potash. The one thing that is really concerning to us in India is just this subsidy that is distorting the applications of both Phosphates and Potash. Potash, for instance, in 1996, the Indian government set out a plan to get to balanced P & K applications. And they set targets of 4 units of nitrogen to 1 unit of Potash at that time. And between then and 2009, they drove that value down to -- on Potash where they were at the target of 4:1. With the changes to the subsidy system and the focus on nitrogen, it is now back up to almost 8:1. So 15 years of very good work thrown out the window. And frankly, that's equivalent to almost 3.5 tonnes of -- 3.5 million tonnes of needed extra Potash in India. Phosphates, very similar. They set a target of 2:1 in that same period and, over the next 15 years, got it down from almost 4:1 to 2:1. Today -- and that was again in 2009 -- today, they're back close to 3:1. So 15 years of very positive impact on getting their nutrition programs balanced, have been lost with this subsidy program, and we think it will be -- it needs to be changed. In-country, people understand that it needs to be changed and when it does, it'll have a significant impact on nutrient markets.","James T. Prokopanko","Chris, I'll just -- you asked about the spot pricing. Understand, in China right now, we still have one more year left to our MOU that we have with Sinofert. That will end in 12\/31\/13, and it's a matter that is -- gets continual discussion at our Canpotex meetings. Board members have -- shareholders have a point of view, and the -- what drives that is what we'll do whatever we think is in the best interest of the member producers of potash companies. We've gone from 12-month contracts in China now to 6-month contracts. So I think you can see the direction we're headed.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank Global Banking and Markets, Research Division","I have a 2-part question on the recent potash agreement between Canpotex and Sinofert. Some believe that the terms of the contract show a departure by Canpotex of a price over volume strategy with the 1 million tonnes exceeding expectations and the magnitude of the price decline coming in a little larger that many thought. Can you provide some color as to whether you see a need for producers such as yourselves to adapt to a more competitive strategy? And then the second part of that question is back to the MOU. You signed for -- or Canpotex signed 1 million tonnes for 1H '13. Based on the October 2010 MOU, I believe it was signed for about 3.15 million tonnes. We shouldn't be using this 1 million tonnes as a run rate for the second half of the year as well, is that correct? I only see a few hundred thousand tonnes being left to complete that MOU.","James T. Prokopanko","Okay. Two questions. You asked about changing competitive landscape and perhaps just about what's happening in the industry structure is what's behind that. Let's put it in context for the kind of year we're in. We've seen this year, Potash sales down about 4 million tonnes. Potash purchases by buyers down 4 million tonnes. I think that drop in the market caused some players to be more aggressive than what I think was necessary, and they were just very aggressive. They didn't want -- they saw sales down and they wanted to maintain share and that's the behavior we saw. With a return to normalized and continuing growing Potash demand, I think that will be a passing thing, steady 55 million to 57 million tonnes I think we're seeing for this -- the coming year. That will cure the pricing, and we do see strengthening pricing going forward as products -- as we now see 1 million tonnes moving, I expect more will be bought in China and India's, I just anticipate, is just around the corner. Now the second question I'll turn it over to Rick.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, the agreement has several points to it, more based upon seaborne imports. So I wouldn't forecast that this means 2 million tonnes that Canpotex will do with Sinofert. It is a very good start to the year in the remaining portion of the MOU.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial Group.","Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","A question, I want to follow-up on Potash and your outlook for both 2013 and beyond. You've cut your shipment forecast from 58 million to 60 million tonnes to 55 million to 57 million tonnes, but I note that you've also got lower operating rates in 2013 and beyond, you used to assume a return to 90% plus. Now you've got below 90%. So the specific question would be in 2013, what's your new forecast for Indian imports? And as we get beyond 2013, are you less optimistic on operating rates because of more capacity coming online or just a lower rate of demand growth?","James T. Prokopanko","I'm going to ask Dr. Rahm to address that question.","Michael Rahm","Yes, and in terms of our revisions, we've taken down our 2013 estimates to 55 million to 57 million tonnes from our previous 58 million to 60 million tonnes. Most of that is due to a downward revision in India, a little bit less also projected for Indonesia and Malaysia. Going forward, we would expect that in 2014, that probably rebounds to the 59 million tonne range and then increases by 2.5% to 3% for the next 3 to 4 years. So in 2017, we're projecting demand of -- in the 63 million, 64 million tonne range. And if you compare that to capacity at that time, we're probably in the mid-70s in terms of effective capacity. So what that means in terms of operating rates is that we think operating rates will range in between about 85% and 90% of capacity, which we think is still a very positive story for the Potash market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A question on India and actually on the Phosphates side. In your prepared remarks, you talked about India returning to the Potash market this year, and I wanted to get more of your thoughts on Phosphates. You've had issues with the DAP imports coming down, lower 1Q finished product operating rates in-country, the rupee remains an issue and then you have the subsidy. And so I was hoping to reconcile that -- all of those issues with your outlook for global phosphate trade in 2013 and how you think about the Indian phosphate market.","James T. Prokopanko","Adam, we're going to have Mike continue with that answer.","Michael Rahm","All right. Yes, we've taken our phosphate imports or phosphate shipment estimate down to 63 million to 65 million tonnes, and we had been guiding 64 million to 66 million tonnes earlier, and again much of that is due to the decline in India. In the case of India, we saw fairly steady imports through about the middle to third quarter of the year and that obviously has come to an end. And we think that DAP inventories in India probably rose to 3.1 million tonnes at the start of the rabi season. With the shut off of imports and with domestic fabrication industry running at lower rates, we think those inventories are going to get drawn down to kind of that 1.4 million tonne range by the end of this fiscal year. So I think Rick can comment, but our assessment is that they will need to begin to line up shipments for their 2013, '14 fiscal year, late first quarter or first part of the second calendar quarter.","Richard N. McLellan","I think you've nailed it, Mike. I think it will be the beginning of the second quarter that we'll see the discussions and the arrangements for shipments of phosphate into India.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi.","P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","BPC was sending more Potash over rails to China last year. And this year, the fact that Canpotex jumped ahead of BPC in China negotiations, is there anything to read into that?","James T. Prokopanko","P.J., no, I don't think there's much to report -- read into it. As I had said earlier, world demand was down about 4 million tonnes. In China, they were quite aggressive with rail shipments into Northern China and was simple as that, interestingly, and Mike might add some color. But Chinese consumption has been -- is steady year-over-year. They haven't reduced conception of Potash. Our MOU calls for a certain fixed amount of seaborne shipments, and I guess we did have our -- agreed-to share of seaborne shipments, but seaborne shipments were down. So 30% of a lower number isn't what we like to see and we weren't happy with that and negotiations proceeded. And the Chinese need and they recognize, and I do believe the Indians, you can't put all your eggs in one basket. That is a high-risk game in a very, very important industry. So you're going to see the Chinese, the Indians balance out their imports and they -- it is crucial for both of them to have Canadian producers as part of it. Do you have anything add to that, Mike?","Michael Rahm","I can add just a little bit of color commentary. We think the Potash inventory situation in China prior to the start of their fall application season was on the high side, probably in that 4 million tonne range. We think by the end of the calendar year, with the drop off in imports that, that's dropped back down to about 3.2 million tonnes. They have imported -- they will import 6.3 million tonnes this year. We think they'll import 6.5 million tonnes or more next year. And certainly, I think we're getting off to a very good start there. In fact, there could be I think some upside to Potash import demand in China in 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Olga Guteneva - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Olga Guteneva sitting in for Jeff. Quickly on phosphate, just to follow-up on the previous question, so are you done with your shipments to India by now?","James T. Prokopanko","Rick McLellan, our commercial leader, will address that.","Richard N. McLellan","Yes, we -- on our Indian shipments that PhosChem has, we have 2 shipments left that will happen in the first quarter and have been arranged for that. And that ends the existing MOU that we had. India still will be a very important market to us, and we are in negotiation with those customers about where we go from here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carroll from UBS Securities.","Bill Carroll - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","It looks like the new ammonia plant being contemplated would add about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes, which would be less than the 1 million tonnes or so that you're short. So I'm just wondering if you're also going to do -- be doing some debottlenecking to kind of make up for that difference?","James T. Prokopanko","Yes, good question, Bill, and I'm going to ask Joc O'Rourke, our COO, to address that. It's his project and he could add some details.","James C. O'Rourke","Yes. Bill, Joc O'Rourke here. As you mentioned, the announcement set a 700,000-tonne ammonia plant, and you're absolutely right. We have stated we are going to build about 1 million tonnes of capacity, of which 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes will come from a new ammonia plant and the other 200,000 to 300,000 tonnes will come from debottlenecking and expansion of our existing plant. As such, we are still on track to complete our front-end engineering, as Jim said, by middle of the year and make a final decision on 1 million tonnes of increased capacity by midyear.","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","And Joc, it's Larry. Just to add -- to respond further to an earlier question. With respect to the funding of that project, if we proceed with it, it would likely entail capital expenditures in the $300 million to $350 million range for several years beginning late next -- or late this year. And again, we would expect to be able to fund that through operating cash flow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets Canada","I had a couple of questions. Following up on some of Rick's comments about India and some of the N to K and N to P ratios that you spoke of, maybe you could speak about whether there's maybe some doubt among some of the Indian co-ops, buyers, farming associations, farmers, what have you about whether those improved scientifically-recommended application rates have actually led to better yields. And the second question I want to ask was on Esterhazy. Now that you've got the Esterhazy tonnes back, with the tolling agreement done and you have a greater share, of course, of Canpotex allocation, what is your sense here? Is there a sense that he could lose some share in North America as one of your -- as Potash Corporation maybe tries to put more product in North America from some of its lost offshore volumes?","James T. Prokopanko","I'll have Rick continue with that line of question.","Richard N. McLellan","I think in India, the major buyers that -- of potash and phosphate are very concerned about what's happened with these ratios, and they got a lot of talk at the recent FAI. There's really 2 major concerns. One is the amount of nitrogen that's being applied is not ending up in the crop. And in fact, it's ending up giving some environmental issues and getting into watersheds. It's a significant issue that they're concerned about. And the second is they haven't -- unlike other parts of the world, they don't have a soil mine of phosphate and potash they can draw from, and they're very worried that this will cause problems in future yields. And looking back, I don't think there's a point where they would say it's impacted yields so far. But I would say the whole industry is very concerned about what the impact is in the future and hoping to get some change in place.","James T. Prokopanko","I'll just add one thing to that, and then you'll have the Esterhazy question. This is agronomy. This isn't alchemy. This is pure outright science. Using the periodic table in biology, the FAI, the Federation of -- Fertiliser Association of India, has written a letter to the Ministry asking that subsidies be reduced for nitrogen. They know, they see. You compare wheat yields in India versus Pakistan -- their similar growing conditions, farming conditions -- wheat yields continue to grow in Pakistan; they've got balanced nutrition. They're leveling out in India. So this is just a matter of time before it gets addressed. There's political issues, coalition governments. It's a complex matter, the whole fertilizer subsidy industry, but there is no doubt by anybody in India in the industry that you have to have balanced crop nutrition. With that, the Esterhazy question, about losing share. Rick, do you want to talk about that, how you see that playing out in the North American market?","Richard N. McLellan","Yes. It's a very, very good question. Our share will go up with the reversion of the Esterhazy. Our share of Canpotex shipments will go up with the share of the Esterhazy reverting to us. And part of the programs we put in place that allowed us to improve on our second quarter results with warehouse agreements in North America were part of the plan so that we could place those tonnes. So no, we don't see an impact in North America, and we -- it puts us in a position to also help Canpotex grow.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-up on that. The changes you put in place include what some people call consignment and some people think that's a dirty word. So I wonder if you can elaborate a little bit on whether you are continuing to expand that process. But my second question was with respect to the comment about the 2 million tonnes to be evaluated in 2013. Those projects are now finished. So is it the ramp that you're evaluating or is it something else?","James T. Prokopanko","I'm going to have Rick talk about consignment and exclusive phase contracts. It's not a dirty word. It's a real value creator both for us and for our customers. So Rick?","Richard N. McLellan","I think I'll deal with that. Frankly, one of the things that we heard loud and clear from customers was they were avert -- they had some aversion to risk. And so the concerns that we hear from people is this is consignment. Sorry, it's not. It's an exclusive space agreement. It's an agreement between customer and supplier to take a certain amount of tonnes during certain periods over the year. We get asked questions like the customer can always buy it below of the markets. That's not taking place. We're getting value for having the product in place when the customer needs to use it. And frankly, the biggest concern -- the biggest positive that I see coming out of that helped us in this fall in North America, where we had product in place with customers per agreements. They were able to grow their business, and we were able to capture the value of the product in-country, in North America while markets were softening at the Gulf.","James T. Prokopanko","Yes, I'll take the second question, the second question with respect to proposed versus approved Potash expansion projects. Recall that we outlined several years ago a 5 million tonne expansion program consisting of a number of projects. We are executing on 3 million tonnes of those projects, which are going very well on time, on budget, on scope. We have decisions to make as to whether we will proceed with the remaining 2 million tonnes of expansion projects, and we'll begin making those decisions this calendar year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC World Markets.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets Inc., Research Division","A few questions. First, on the Canpotex deal, do you expect that BPC will settle at a similar price? And if they do settle at a different price, would there be any type of retroactive adjustment to the Canpotex deal? And then the second part would be just on the final approval of the Faustina ammonia plant. What is that contingent on? Would that be a gas contract or -- maybe you can elaborate.","James T. Prokopanko","First question, BPC, don't know what they're going to do. I would -- I'd really be perplexed to understand that they'd -- if they'd weaken after what -- after Canpotex, but just don't know what their plans are. As I said, the key point is China, and we believe it has we think low Potash inventories and has to restock, and they don't have a lot of time at this point to restock. So I'm anticipating there will be something shortly coming out of BPC, and just to reiterate, why would you go below what Canpotex sold at? The next is on what some of the contingencies are around the ammonia plant, and I'm going to have Joc speak to that.","James C. O'Rourke","Your question, I believe, was is there-- does there need to be an ammonia -- a natural gas contract to drive the ammonia project? I guess the way I would answer that is we are studying the economics of the ammonia project. We will pursue some long-term natural gas contracts. But we would not say that the project is contingent on that. We will be looking at the economics to Mosaic and the strategic value of that project either on a spot basis or contract-based depending on how we ultimately structure our natural gas contracts.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Charles Neivert from Dahlman Rose.","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of quick questions, just more on the technical side. When you're looking at the ratios in India and China that have been trying to improve, has the ratio deteriorated because they've used less Potash or because they're using a lot more nitrogen? I mean, meaning Potash being sort of flat and maybe even slightly up, but nitrogen just overwhelms the growth or has it been something where Potash is actually being pushed out in favor of more nitrogen? And then a follow-up on Ma'aden.","James T. Prokopanko","Sorry, the question on Ma'aden?","Charles N. Neivert - Dahlman Rose & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, and then the follow-up question just is where does Ma'aden stand right now? Of the 3 million tonnes that they're supposedly going to have at full rates, where do you guys see them sort of now, and when might they get up to their -- when do you think they might get up to their full rates?","James T. Prokopanko","Okay, I'm going to -- okay, Charles, I'm going to have Rick or Mike address the question on India nutrient to ratios, and then I'll just answer your Ma'aden question.","Richard N. McLellan","Charles, I can address the ratios. I think it's really a combination of both. We've seen very good increases in nitrogen consumption in India. But the rate of increase in P & K has not kept pace with that, and here recently has actually declined significantly, causing those ratios to drop. And as Rick pointed out, if you go back and take a look at history, the P -- or the N to P -- N to K ratio was as high as 10% back in the mid-1990s. They steadily pulled that down to their target in about 2009, 2010, and that -- all of that progress has quickly evaporated in the last couple of years. As Rick pointed out, if assuming you think nitrogen use is kind of at an optimal level or appropriate level in India, if you were to get those ratios back to the FAI targets, it would imply 3.5 million additional tonnes of MOP consumption and about 4 million tonnes of additional DAP consumption.","James T. Prokopanko","Charles, on your question about Ma'aden, we don't know with a lot of certainty. We, in our grid, supply-demand grid, we put them in this past year, producing about 1.2 million tonnes for the year. We think they've had some struggles getting it started and that's no surprise. This is a mega project and a lot of complexity. We anticipate they will get to their full nameplate capacity of about 3 million tonnes by the end of 2013; early 2014, they'll be at full capacity. And we just don't know. If you or any of your colleagues are up at the northern Saudi Arabia, at the border of Jordan and Iraq where the mine is and you see something, let us know. But we think they're going to get there in just a matter of time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.","David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Jim, can you just discuss again convergence of offshore and onshore prices, specifically right now, the impact of the China settlement on Brazil in the short term, and even on U.S., the farmer behavior on pricing in the long term.","James T. Prokopanko","David, I'll give you a brief answer, then I'm going to just turn it over to Rick and Mike. Rick's got some first-hand experience, insights into what's happening in Brazil recently. But we're seeing North America market moving nicely. Our products starting to -- moving at the recent posted prices, and that was prices before the China contract was announced and we don't see that slowing down. Rick, what do you see happening in Brazil?","Richard N. McLellan","I think the prices that are in Brazil right now have reflected some changes over the last 2 to 3 months. But I think the key takeaway is the value for the farmer, whether it be in Brazil or whether it be in North America, or the amount of dollars spent to put crop nutrients into their crop for this next year has probably never been lower and is a great value at where it's at. I think the other piece that you have to understand is the market is 2 markets. The Brazil, North American market is a granular market. The Chinese market and the Indian market and the Malaysia, Indonesia market is standard. And inventory levels for granular product or blend grade product were low and we saw a build of standard product. So Mike, back to you.","Michael Rahm","Yes, the only thing I would add there is Jim mentioned the tale of 2 hemispheres. It's really a tale of 2 hemispheres and a tale of 2 grades of potash. And in the Western Hemisphere, we have seen record shipments of P & K during the fall season, which we define as June through November. If you look at shipments in Brazil P & K, they also are at record levels, up I believe 6% this year on the tail of 11% increase the year before. So P & K demand in the Western Hemisphere, frankly, is booming. And as Rick said, it's a granular market, and the markets in Asia are on their tail to some extent, and that largely is a standard market.","James T. Prokopanko","David, understand -- it's important that these farm economics and the relative price of fertilizer -- the price of fertilizer relative to grain prices -- haven't been better in the last 10 or 15 years. Just a terrific situation for the farmer customers. They are going to be applying fertilizer in good volumes, and they don't want to miss the opportunity to produce maximum yields given these near-historic high grain prices. And it's a different game in North America and the Southern Hemisphere. Larger farms, larger commercial farms, larger application equipment and I think bigger potential to impact yields than they do in some of the Eastern markets. So the fertilizer prices as a percentage of the total farm income statement is -- the cost side, it's pretty small.","James T. Prokopanko","And I just want to conclude and say that -- and reiterate our 3 key messages. First, ag economics are extremely strong around the world. Second, we're dealing with some short-term challenges that have begun to resolve themselves. And third, our balance sheet strength uniquely positions us to take advantage of opportunities. And finally, our confidence in Mosaic's future has never been stronger. Our critical mission of helping the world grow the food it needs holds great promise for our customers, our employees, our communities and for you, our shareholders. Thanks for joining us. Have a great day, and have a great year.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

(Operator Instructions) Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, please go ahead.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions, after our prepared remarks.","After my introductory comments, Jim will review Mosaic's accomplishments for the quarter and our views on current and future market conditions. Larry will provide an update on our capital management and share insights into our future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date, May 06, 2014, and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jim.","James Prokopanko","Good morning. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings discussion. I would like to start by expressing my gratitude to all of you, who have wished me well. I have been overwhelmed by the outpouring supports, and I can tell you that the encouragement I received from so many people in and around this industry has lifted my spirits, as I undergo treatment. I continue to feel fit and well and have no other updates on my health today. We will be sure to keep you apprised if anything changes.","Now, let's get to our results. Here is what I'd like you take away from today's call. First, the business environment remains challenging. Second, we, at Mosaic, are focused on what we can control and we continue to make great progress both strategic and financial. Finally, our future remains extremely bright.","The combination of increased crop nutrient affordability and weather-driven supply uncertainty significantly increased distributed willingness to take price risk. This demand strength combined with previously positioned product resulted in strong North American sales volumes, in spite of the well-known weather-related logistical challenges.","In Canada, the extremely cold and stormy winter delayed many rail shipments. A condition exacerbated by shortage of locomotives and a congested system due to increasing grain and commodity volumes. As a result, our international volumes were low and we faced short-term containment issues in Canada.","We continue to see diversion trends at our two nutrients. In phosphates, the price rally that began in earnest late last year continued into the first quarter, with average selling prices in the quarter reaching $414 per ton. Producer margins expanded from unsustainable lower levels.","Logistics challenges faced by some of our global competitors and strong demand fueled the increases. We are beginning to see prices leveling off. A seasonal impact, as we move through the North American spring, with the second half outlook expected to be a function of several factors, notable a rebound in Indian demand and the impact of Chinese exports.","In this environment, we are very well-positioned in the best cortile of the cost curve with a distinctive large and growing premium product offering.","In potash, shipment volumes remain behind plan. With one month behind us in the second quarter, we're continuing to ship at maximum current logistical capacity. Potash prices remain near the floor, established at the end of 2013, as supply and demand remain relatively balanced.","We see upside potential, as these relatively low prices could drive even higher demand in the second half of 2014. Our product and geographic diversification is benefiting us, as we adapt and manage through these challenges.","A quick note on economics. I keep insisting that fundamental economics will prevail. As I said, there are many factors influencing the price of potash and phosphates, from weather to politics, to fluctuating currencies and other events. In the end, the market set the price.","And in the commodity business, like the fertilizer industry, temporary strategies to pursue higher volumes at the expense of profit maximization may indeed change market shares in the short-term, but a little to alter the long-term economics of the business. We're seeing that truth born out yet again in 2014.","Despite the challenges and opportunities created by the external conditions, Mosaic delivered another solid quarter with prices and volumes for both phosphate and potash coming comfortably close to our expectations.","For the quarter, we generated operating earnings of $267 million on revenues of $2 billion. We generated $627 million in cash flows during the quarter, as a result of earnings and lower working capital, driven by converting product positioned in North American warehouses to revenue and cash.","At Mosaic, we continue to monitor and adapt to the environment, but we are focused on the things we can control. We continue to make excellent progress, delivering on the commitments we've made to you and our other stakeholders. We closed our phosphate acquisition in Florida and integration is moving along well. Larry, will provide more detail on this shortly.","We announced an agreement to acquire ADM's Brazil fertilizer distribution business for $350 million, including $150 million of working capital. The acquisition, which complements approximately $100 million in expansion projects, already underway, would increase our distribution capacity in Brazil from 4 million tons to 6 million tons. The majority of which are potash and phosphate.","Growing our Brazilian distribution business is one of our key strategic initiatives for a good reason. Plant nutrient use in Brazil has increased nearly 7% per year during the last five years and shipments are off to another fast start this year. Year-over-year total shipments were up 11% and phosphate and potash imports were up 77% and 48% respectively in the first quarter.","Our previously announced projects are proceeding as planned. The Esterhazy K3 mines shafts are both more than a 1,000 feet below surface and they are successfully making their way through a major water formation. And construction is underway on the phosphate join venture in Saudi Arabia.","We made still more progress towards achieving our balance sheet targets by repurchasing $1.7 billion of stock in the quarter. In the four months, after we were first able to repurchase shares, beginning last November, we've repurchased or committed to repurchase 52 million shares. That's over 12% of our shares outstanding. We have transformed our balance sheet and put billions of dollars of capital to work. This is another topic Larry will cover.","We reached the decision to expand our MicroEssentials capacity to 3.5 million tons annually. We will convert part of our New Wales Plant to MicroEssentials production over the next year, adding 1.2 million tons of capacity.","We have maintained a strong safety record and environmental performance, with a record low reportable injury rate during the quarter. Our performance reflects our continuous improvement approach to operational excellence and the well-being of our people, and we're implementing concrete plans to save costs.","While many of the decisions we've made have been difficult, we're making the right moves to increase the efficiency of our operations, at the same time that we are taking substantial costs out of our corporate support functions. Obviously, our acquisitions bring with them additional people and expenses, and we continue to see inflationary pressures.","That said, we are in the process of taking out $0.5 billion of cost across Mosaic over the next five years, with a focus of maintaining our best cortile cost position in phosphates and improving our cost group position in potash. These cost saving initiatives will result in elimination of more than 500 positions in the next 12 months.","We will rely on attrition, elimination of contractors and early retirements, and regrettably there will also be impacts to our employees in the form of targeted layoffs in 2014. We achieved many strategic accomplishments in 2013, and we are not done yet. Our vision is for Mosaic to be the world's leading crop nutrition company, and I believe we are positioned to be just that.","Now, I'll ask Larry to address financial topics and provide our guidance. Before we take your questions, I'll give you some thoughts on the markets and quarters ahead. Larry?","Lawrence Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim, and good morning, all. This morning, I would like to cover four topics: first, our capital and balance sheet; second, the CF integration and our expectations for the acquisition; third, our financial results; and fourth, our guidance.","Let's start with the balance sheet. As Jim said, we have made great progress. As recently as last fall, investors were clamoring for us, to put our cash to use and eagerly awaiting the exploration of restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares.","As of today, through several transactions, we have repurchased 42.4 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion, and have agreements to repurchase an additional 9.3 million shares by the end of July of this year. It's worth repeating, in just four months, from the end of November 2013 to the end of March, we committed to repurchase 12% of the company's outstanding shares, and we've maintained our $1 per year dividend.","All the while, we have funded $1.4 billion to purchase CF Industries' phosphate business, we have begun funding our joint venture with Ma'aden, we committed $350 million to purchase ADM's Brazilian and Paraguay fertilizer business, we plan to spend over $1 billion for sustaining capital and opportunity investments in 2014, and we have set aside funds over $600 million to fulfill our asset retirement obligations.","In addition, we're crafting a much better capital structure. We have issued $2 billion in low interest long-term debt and plan to drawdown $800 million in term loans. My message is this, we told you, we would put our cash to use and create an efficient balance sheet, and we have done so, by both growing the business and returning capital to investors.","Let me remind you, our capital priorities are to maintain our ratings and financial flexibility, sustain our assets and our dividend, invest for organic growth, pursue external growth opportunities, and finally, return surplus capital to our shareholders.","We told you, we would hit our stated balance sheet and liquidity targets by mid 2014 and we believe we will. We expect our leverage ratio, adjusted debt to EBITDA to be well within the range we communicated to you last May, in the range of 1.5 to 2 to 1. Beyond 2014, subsequent capital returns will be a function of cash flow generation and available investment opportunities.","Now, I'll move on to the CF Industries' phosphate business integration, which as Jim said is proceeding according to plan. We welcomed about 700 new employees to Mosaic, and we are finding the cultural fit to be excellent. We share values and steadfast commitments to safety and environmental stewardship.","Jack and I just spent two days visiting our new operations and we're most impressed with the quality of the facilities and especially the quality and high engagement levels of our new employees. Going forward, of course, our phosphate guidance will include CF results. It's important to note that for the second quarter, our margin on tons from the former CF facilities is expected to be close to zero.","This is the result of acquisition accounting requirements mandating that inventory we purchased from CF is mark-to-market. This accounting rule has no impact on cash flows. We are on track to achieve or exceed the targets we have previously set for the acquisition and of course the EPS accretion is even greater, given we have repurchased shares since these targets were set.","Now, I'll move on to our financial results for the quarter. The year-over-year decline in market prices and the beginning resurgence of demand are reflected in our results. And since Jim already covered market prices and volume drivers, I will focus on expenses.","Comparisons to last year's first calendar quarter for both operating segments and the corporate segment were impacted by the change in our fiscal year, as our annual equity performance award expenses were recorded in the quarter ended March 31.","In addition, as Jim mentioned, we have programs in place to remove approximately $0.50 billion in costs across Mosaic over the next fiver years, and we plan to achieve that goal through operating efficiencies and labor savings.","To emphasize the importance of this, we have implemented a special equity incentive tied to achievement of aggressive goals. This non-cash expense related to this award was also recorded in the quarter.","Finally, we also recorded higher other operating expenses related to these cost initiatives. Specifically, we recorded $6 million in the first quarter in our potash segment for early retirement and severance cost.","In phosphates, we experienced strong demand and good price momentum. The year-over-year decline in gross margin dollars reflects lower finished product prices, partially offset by lower raw material cost. Our gross margin rate in the segment was lower than expected, primarily due to a longer than anticipated lag time between pricing and delivery of our premium products.","In potash, within our price and volume guidance ranges, despite the logistical challenges that impacted volumes, operating rate and gross margin rate, on a year-over-year basis, operating earnings declined to $166 million, down from $306 million. As you can clearly see from this slide, the lower sales prices had a significant effect on our earnings, only partially offset by higher sales volumes.","Finally, I'll cover our near-term outlook and guidance for the second quarter of 2014. Our outlook is positive. In the near-term, we expect modest margin expansion in phosphates and stable operating rates in potash.","In the latter half of the year, we expect continuing improvements in business conditions. Of course, many unknowns will influence the environment, including U.S. crop plantings and progress as well as demand from India and exports from China.","Global demand prospects continue to look positive, bolstered by strong rallies in a wide array of agricultural and livestock prices during the first quarter. We project that shipments of the main solid phosphate products will increase nearly 4% to a record 65.5 million tons this year. We have narrowed our forecast range from 64 million to 66 million tons, to 65 million to 66 million tons.","In the case of potash, we projected MLP shipments will rebound more than 7% to a record 57.4 million tons in 2014. We have also narrowed our forecast range from 57 million to 59 million tons to 57 million to 58 million tons. The slides in the appendix highlight the changes by region from our last forecast in February.","In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 3.1 million to 3.4 million tons for the second quarter compared to 2.9 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $460 per ton. Mosaic's phosphates' operating rate is expected to be in the mid-80% range during the second quarter.","The phosphate segment gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be in the high-teens. The impact of the accounting requirement resulting in purchased finished goods inventory having no margin is expected to negatively impact gross margin by 3 percentage points.","In the second quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.2 million to 2.5 million tons compared with actual volumes at 2.4 million tons in the same period of last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $250 to $275 per ton, including a higher proportion of exports than reflected in the first quarter.","The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the high 20% range. Our operating rate in potash during the second quarter is expected to improve to the mid-80% range. We expect to continue to ship as fast as logistically feasible.","Our 2014, Canadian resource taxes and royalties expectations remain in the range of $120 million to $180 million. Expectations for full year brine management expenses to continue to be around $200 million. Also for full year 2014, we estimate SG&A expenses to be approximately $400 million to $425 million, including cost savings initiatives and the impact of the CF phosphates business acquisition.","Other expenses, for which we don't historically provide guidance, will include severance and early retirement-related charges. As we did in the first quarter, we will include these as notable items as they occur.","For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, continuing in the mid-to-high 20% range and capital expenditures and equity investments in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments in our Saudi joint venture.","With that, I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James Prokopanko","Thank you, Larry. We've seen a number of recent reports expressing weariness with the long-term fertilizer story. I think I get it. We talk in grandiose terms about the need for global food security, the ever-growing global population, the slow increase in new land dedicated to agriculture, and we talk about it all the time.","The reports I've seen, seem to imply we want to minimize the short-term challenges by diverting attention to long-term need. And I will concede, I think I've made the statement that we manage Mosaic for the long-term on just about every quarterly earnings call over the past few years. But the skeptic will say that the long term is like tomorrow, it never arrives.","I'd like to address the skeptics with a few thoughts. First, as we've said many times, this is a cyclical business with higher highs and higher lows, as we move through time. That presents opportunity for all of us. Opportunity for strong companies to invest in the troughs, as Mosaic has done through this period and opportunities for investors as the cycle turns.","The tendency we all have is to project current conditions on the long-term. To think that the present trends in global agriculture with commodity prices down will continue in perpetuity. History is not your friend, if you hold this view. Yes, agriculture is volatile, but its long trend is upward.","Second, the short-term past and future has been and will be far less dire than has been portrayed for global agriculture and for the fertilizer industry, specifically. We remain solidly profitable at the lower end of the cycle.","At Mosaic, we've generated consistently strong cash flows. We've used our balance sheet strength to make highly promising investments for the bright future ahead and we've returned significant capital to shareholders, all while generating good profits in tough times.","And a further note on the short term. Farm economics, which lie at the heart of our business proposition, remain compelling today, particularly with corn prices back around $5 a bushel. The drop in commodity prices has been much discussed and it has decreased farmers' revenues, but at least as it relates to our business, the affordability of crop nutrients remains very compelling for farmers.","That brings me back to the long-term. Listen, we tell the food story all the time, because we believe in it. Around, the world more people need to eat, more of them have the means to buy and consume protein and little additional land is being devoted to production agriculture.","And therein is the sweet spot for crop nutrition. Sustainable intensification is essential to feed the world, and fertilizer used correctly is the most important means to that end. So what we have here around the bottom of the cycle is Mosaic generating solid profits and making big investments to achieve the tremendous promises of future. That's our story. It's true and it's compelling.","One note, before we take your questions. I've been deeply touched and humbled by the outpouring of good wishes for my health, from those of you on this call and elsewhere. If people argue that the financial markets' crowd does not have a heart, I have proof to the contrary.","I would now appreciate, if we can get straight to business with your questions. Thanks in advance for that. Operator, over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi.","PJ Juvekar - Citi","A question on potash. If you look at Russian rail shipments of potash to China, I think they are down more than 40%. What impact do you think this has on the global supply demand and pricing?","James Prokopanko","Astute observation, something we've recognized ourselves, although just to make a comment on that, and then turn it over to Rick McLellan, leader of our Commercial group. We've seen that, I think we are now approaching one year since there has been some aggressive actions by the Eastern Europeans to build share in the marketplace.","I think one year since they've made that decision, they're finding that -- and I made it in my comments, market shares may have increased, but when they look at their last restatements, I don't think anything is getting to the bottomline as a result of that.","And in fact, I think it's been negative to that. So I think people are starting to recognize that they got to be more thoughtful about not just how much they sell, but what they earn in selling it and that's impacted some of our competitors willingness to-go-market.","Richard McLellan","PJ, we just got back from a trip with Canpotex to China and the rail shipments did come up when we were there. They are down year-over-year 46%. And whether that's a function of weather related, we're not really sure. But the one thing we do know is that the shipments by vessel are up, which frankly for us being a vessel shipper makes great sense, and we're pleased about that.","We think that over the year, we're going to see real shipments start to ramp back up into the northern part of China, but it bodes well for more tons being needed to be shipped-in in the second quarter or in the second half. And I think that's the piece with China change in rail that will be helpful to the market or constructive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess two-part question. Can you speak to how you see the $500 million in cost savings flowing through over the next five years, and then a similar question for the CF synergies of $40 million to $50 million? And perhaps you could touch on the second quarter impact for each of those that you anticipate?","James Prokopanko","Good morning. Kevin, welcome to the call. I'm going to ask Larry to help me out with detailing the timing of the $500 million. But this is something that the $500 million, as we previously announced at our New York Investor Day in October. The point I want to make is this has been a well thought-out plan, well detailed and considered.","And in that context, at Mosaic, we pride ourselves in achieving what we say we're going to achieve, whether it's in strategy or operating performance. And I just want to stress that we are confident. We are going to achieve those $500 million of savings. We're really putting our shoulder to it, look to achieve much of those savings earlier rather than later. And I'll have Larry speak to the timing of that as well as what we are looking with the CF integration.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Kevin, as Jim said, this is part of our program we laid out at our Analyst Day meeting. We're targeting $200 million-plus in each of the operating units over the next five years. We're targeting $50 million-plus from corporate over the next five years. As Jim noted, we'd hope to get, and expect to get, the bulk of that over the first two to three years.","Note that, much of this program is intended to offset the effects of inflation. Particularly, in phosphates, we're already at the very low-end of the cost curve. And so the program there is intended to allow us to fully offset the effects of inflation and remain at the very low-end of the cost curve.","In potash, we're currently on the wrong side of median on the cost curve. We intend to get to the left side of median on the cost curve. And so the desired effect is to offset the effects of inflation and then some. And in incorporate as we've discussed with you in the past, we've recognized for some time, we have an opportunity to do things more efficiently and more effectively, and we've gone about a program that's just being implemented, as we speak, to get the kinds of savings that we've outlined.","On top of that, as you've noted, there will be significant synergy savings with the CF. We're delighted by what we've seen so far with CF and the opportunities that we have there. We expect to begin achieving meaningful synergy savings in calendar 2015, so some of those will extend into 2016 and beyond.","Note that, as a result of this, this is a multiyear program. One should not expect to see substantial savings in the current year, certainly not in the second quarter. But you will see these savings over time, it will allow us to remain a very cost competitive player in this industry and that's our primary intention.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Korn from Barclays.","Matthew Korn - Barclays","I was looking at the progress of your potash shipment forecast. It is very interesting to see that Europe looks like it's been a little bit lighter than expected, maybe that makes Brazil a little bit better. Could you discuss a little bit the reasons that those respective markets have been unfolding the way they have? And then, looking into the next year, if we've got conviction, and we've got to believe to rank it above say 60 million in tons total shipments. Are the hopes really pinned on Brazil kind of continuing the growth pace they've been on?","James Prokopanko","Brazil is really a shining star, not just in potash, but phosphate as well. Both our nutrients are really firing on all cylinders, going into Brazil. I'm going to ask Mike to add his insights on, how the world is rebouncing in terms of potash demand? Mike?","Michael Rahm","Let's start with Brazil, first. We're projecting that imports in 2014 will be about 8.4 million tons, so up from about 7.6 million. So Brazil, certainly, is the engine pulling this train. First quarter was fantastic. Imports were up 48%, 1.8 million tons versus 1.2 million tons a year ago. So Brazil continues to be a shining star. And we expect that, as we move into peak shipment months this summer, as they position product for their planting season, we'll see an uptick in those shipments.","In terms of Europe and the FSU, we're not as close to that market. We tend to rely more on consultants for that. And just to give you some perspective, FERTECON is projecting that shipments in the European theatre, defined as Former Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and Western Europe, they are projecting 1 million ton increase in shipments from 10.2 million to 11.2 million.","We've tapered that down a little bit and expect shipments to increase from 10.2 million to about 10.8 million, about a 600,000 ton increase. I think some of the same fundamental drivers in terms of decent commodity prices very low pipeline, all come into play in that theatre as well. And as you say, and as we look ahead to 2015, our preliminary numbers begin with a six.","So we expect that the same fundamentals that are in play today continue in terms of very good farm economics, not only for the corn, soybeans and wheat. But if you look at things like palm oil, coffee, what not, you're looking at double-digit increases in those commodities as well as commodities like fruits and vegetables that are very heavy potash user. So I think there is unappreciated demand story out there developing, and we expect trends we're seeing now to continue into 2015.","James Prokopanko","Matthew, I'm just going to add to that the principal hole in the potash demand story is, comes down to two countries, India and China. And that's where we've seen a lot, but we haven't seen the demand growth. In fact, we've seen retrenchment in demand.","In the case of India -- in both India and China, it's not a matter of, if the demands are going to come back, it's going to be when. Messages coming out of India, post this national election, is that there will be material reform to the subsidy program. We think that's going to get corrected.","The industry leaders in India believe that, the distributors believe it and most of the senior government people, I'd say, all the senior government people we talk to, they understand it. They get that they have to reform the subsidy system. So with the subsidy reform, we'll see demand come back.","And in China, we're optimistic about the second half. We see a decent demand in this first half and with virtually all their contracts they have optional purchase agreements for the second half. But it's our view that they are going to exercise. So we're going to see, unlike we saw last year, only half-a-year demand from China. We expect full 12 months of good demand from China and see that market recovering.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital","If I look at some of your guidance for Q2, it seems that you're suggesting that North American potash volumes might be flat in Q2 year-over-year, and then phosphate volumes in North America might be up significantly year-over-year. Maybe you talk about some of the drivers for both of that? And also, if you see some residual pricing for potash reducing?","James Prokopanko","I'm going to just turn that right over to Rick McLellan, Leader of our Commercial Group. Rick?","Richard McLellan","As we look at the potash market and we look at our capability is to deliver, we're shipping into North America at frankly the maximum capacity we possibly can. We saw really good growth in the first quarter, 58% year-over-year growth in the first quarter into North America for shipments, and so some of that has to taper off.","In phosphates, it was direct opposite. We saw about 17% increase. So we had more phosphates to deliver to the market in the second quarter. So we think overall phosphates or potash will be relatively flat. And phosphates are going to grow frankly because we're going to have the CF tons that weren't included in our forecast previously.","As far as field potash programs, the price increase that we've got in place is holding. And frankly, I think with the issues that North American dealers have seen with rail performance, they're not going to wait to depend on the rail lines to improve. They're going to get product into place in the summer. And frankly, it looks that if at worst we see the price staying stable, than frankly, there is opportunities for it to move higher.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs","Maybe some questions on potash utilization and gross margins. I think in 2Q you're expecting gross margins to be basically flat quarter-on-quarter, despite utilization moving up to 85% from 70% in 1Q. Maybe help explain that? And on the same line, if you take the guidance for 1Q's utilization in the mid-80s and you on the came in at 70%, so can you just explain what happened on the production side, was that logistics and weather or anything else?","James Prokopanko","We're going to have Joc O'Rourke address what's happening with those shipment numbers that you're asking about.","James O'Rourke","So, Adam, let me start with the first quarter. We were in fact operating at rate of around 70% compared to a guidance of 80% that was almost completely logistics related. Our inability to move product out to the market, because of rail and the cold weather was just about the whole cause of that. And of course, what results from that is, a lower operating rate and of course a higher absorption of costs per ton. So that pretty much covers what happened to us in the first quarter.","In the second quarter, we certainly expect that rate to come up, as we now here Chicago is clear from a rail perspective. So we expect that rate to go up to pretty much fall rates. And as Rick's saying, we'll fill the pipeline for those sales that will come through the summer and what not.","Lawrence Stranghoener","Joc, I would just to add on the margin in the second quarter. I think it's probably a product mix issue, as we'll ship more internationally, where netbacks are lower. And so while operations will be performing at a higher level, I think we'll have some wins in our sales, because of the product mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotiabank","Jim, when I look at what you've done strategically over the past few years in phosphate, which is I guess increased asset exposure offshore, move towards value-added phosphate products like MES and tightened up your Florida margins via the CF acquisition. And when I compare that to falling U.S. phosphate exports, are you preparing for a tougher U.S. export of phosphate market over the next decade, is it possible for the U.S. to get shutout by 2020? How do you see that developing?","James Prokopanko","Those are rapid fire questions, and I'm glad you're asking about the phosphate business that we're quite excited about, very astute. Yes, we are building our phosphate muscles on the belief that we have a strong position in phosphate production, low end of the cost curve, and great assets in terms of 35 to 40 years of proven probable reserves ahead of us and a great location. No one better placed to serve the North American market than Mosaic.","And for that matter, the South American market. We've looked at the world. We do see new production coming on stream. China has been a real dynamo over the last decade, increasing production of phosphates, not of the quality of phosphates that distinguishes Mosaic, but they've grown and going into some of the lower cost markets. And we've see the Middle East grow their phosphate business, and we've chosen to be part of that with our modern investment.","So as we look with at the phosphate growth, we see supply growing at about the same rate that we see demand growing at. We think our home court advantage is principally the western hemisphere and we are extremely well-equipped with the assets we own and operate today to serve both Latin America and North America. Our investment in the Ma'aden project is going to give us the capacity to better serve the Asian markets.","And finally seeing that the commodity phosphate market has become somewhat some competitive, we have turned much more of our attention to our specialty products, MicroEssentials, that we have just announced an expansion that will take us to nearly 4 million tons of production capacity.","That will be up and operating, I think is within 18 or 24 months, Joc O'Rourke can correct me that if I'm wrong, but MicroEssentials has been a homerun for us, both in North America and international market. So yes, it's more competitive, but Mosaic has become more of a competitive company, both with the specialty products and the geographic dispersion of our production capacity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley","Could you talk a little bit about the Southeast Asian market? It seems like prices just aren't finding footing there and they seem to be stuck in sort of a low-300 range whereas the other stock markets have been reverted nicely, following the Chinese settlement. What do you particularly think is going on there? And how do you see that playing out over the balance of the year?","James Prokopanko","The Southeast Asian market since six months ago was probably ground zero where we saw prices come down or weaken. And since that time of about six months ago, and I would say, probably Malaysia was the epicenter of where we saw some low pricing, I think we've seen some recovery -- not think, we have seen recovery as markets have tightened up. Rick McLellan just came back from trip to both India and China and he can give you some first-hand commentary on what we're seeing, as recently as two weeks ago.","Richard McLellan","If you look at the Southeast Asian market, we think that prices are being floated in that 340 to 350 range right now. And there is getting some legs underneath those. It still has to play out about how well they're accepted. The key piece to understand is this is a true standard market.","There is no granular heads to there. And so if you look in the granular side on the markets, getting the improvement in Brazil and probably in our North American markets is going to come because of overall tightness of granular, coarse product. And there is an issue with finding homes for all the standard product. So that's what created a portion of the impact in Malaysia.","And the other piece though that's quite positive is the changes for Southeast Asia, which is really a major palm market, just the increase in palm pricing year-over-year, it's going to lead to demand. And China and India continue to be the other main markets for standard potash. And those markets are starting to move much better than they did last year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","How would you compare global utilization rates in potash and phosphate now and over the next two to three years?","Lawrence Stranghoener","The question was how do we compare phosphate utilization rates between now and the next five years?","Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan","On an industry-wide basis, which is tighter and how might that tightness change over the next two to three years?","Lawrence Stranghoener","The potash market, right now we're seeing over the next two to three years is a -- seeing the results of multiyear potash expansion program by most of the principal producer, so we see the next three years, absent any external force, something happening to a mine of somebody, possible plant mine closures, we see there being more supply than there is demand.","It's growing modestly in the 2% and 2.5% range and it's going to take a while for that to tighten up. So it could be just purely supply and demand, some tough sledding. However, I think people are really getting a dose of some healthy medicine in terms of the kind of returns you get with efforts to try to build market share. There just isn't a return in doing it. So I think we have to just watch what sellers behaviors will be over the next six months and 12 months.","In the case of phosphate, we see a tighter supply and demand balance. We haven't seen the expansions that we've seen in potash. We've had some Middle Eastern expansions. And they are working hard to bring those on line, but it's difficult, bringing a new phosphate plant on line and we just don't see material new tonnage coming out of the Middle East.","And in China, we think the expansion run that they've had over the last decade, seven years on phosphate has pretty much come to an end and they pulled in their horns on that. I'm going to just ask if Mike Rahm has anything to add to that. Mike?","Michael Rahm","No, I think that's a good description, Jim. Just if you want to put some numbers to it, our 57.4 million tons of shipments this year compares to our capacity estimate in that 69 million ton to 70 million ton range. So we're looking at utilization rates for potash in the low-80% range. We think they're going to stay in that range over the next several years.","And I think the key question there is if you compare those rates to the really tight period when we think the industry is running at 95, how do you optimize production at those rates. And I think most of the potash players are working hard to try to optimize operating rates when you need to run at 82% to 85% rather than 95%.","And as Jim said, in phosphate, we see a fairly stable situation at moderately higher rates over the next two to three years, as the demand outlook there continues to look very good. Our shipment forecast for this year is up about 2.3 million tons. And every year we get 2 million tons of additional demand. That is going to stop up some of the additional capacity that comes on.","And as Jim said, the key feature of long-term phosphate outlook is the fact that we think the massive expansion program in China has come to an end and as demand continues to grow that growth is going to be met by new capacity coming from places like Saudi Arabia and Morocco.","Lawrence Stranghoener","And I'll just add to that, Jeff. If you look at the history, and I think we've had seven consecutive years of continued phosphate growth in world demand and this is one that just keeps in the background, just keeps growing year-over-year. And that again just underpins our belief that the phosphate market is a very good market to have a position in.","And I think going back to the previous question about the U.S. industry. We see the U.S. industry continuing to be a very large stable industry, playing a very steady role in the global market where growth and demand will be met by some of the new entrance or new capacity coming from the Mid-East and North Africa.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Couple of things. Jim, with respect to distribution in Brazil, I think it was around the time of the Cargill split. You said that you weren't sure that distribution was necessarily at the top of your core competency list, which is why you were moving carefully. So as you ramp up in Brazil, do you now have the expertise you need or do you still need to add people to take that business where you want to bring it? And then a second question, can you talk about how this new cost reduction program differs from the old operational excellence initiatives?","James Prokopanko","Couple of good questions. Distribution, I'm glad you bring that up. We're quite proud of what has been accomplished in the last 12 months. Two things, we had program that I think we identified is about a $300 million green brownfield expansion of our distribution into Brazil.","And that's been somewhat moderated or has been moderated with the ADM expansion or the ADM acquisition. Why Brazil, why are we so determined to expand our distribution. Well, you've seen what the history of increased imports into Brazil are. Ag continues to grow in Brazil at probably one of the fastest growing rates in the world. We think that's going to continue for some while.","Brazil is a very challenging country to get product from an offshore position into the farmer's hands. They've got challenging -- they have issues with logistics, they don't have a great rail system, they don't have a Mississippi flowing through the country, and having access into the direct farm markets or into the farming region is an important part of getting our product to the marketplace.","Having port access, which is just terribly congested in Brazil, having our own facilities, having control of our own facilities is important and the expansions that we've put in place, both our internal expansions in the ADM acquisition will allow us to get product and be assured of getting our product to the market. That's number one.","Number two. It is a hand in glove with our CF acquisition. We will be able to meet the increased demand that we're forecasting with CF tons. And to the third point, that we have the talent in management to execute on that. The expansion and addition of ADM is going to challenge us. We've got a leadership team that's been effective in the business that we have been operating at present. We know that we have some holes that we'll have to fill and augment and some new talent we have to bring in.","We've got this deal with ADM closing in the end of this 2014 calendar year and that gives us good time to plan for integration and ensuring that we have the right leadership team. I have got a background as Rick McLellan does in distribution and retail operations and we understand that the task at hand and we'll execute on that.","The other question is the operational excellence program, how is that different than our current cost reduction program that we have in place. We've been continually focusing on the cost side of our business. This one is a right-sizing effort that has a different approach than we've had in the past. We are looking at the next three and five-year forecast. We are right-sizing our business to what we think will be a stable operating rate both potash and phosphate.","And its 10-year since Mosaic was formed, it has allowed us to just better understand the business that goes without saying, but also we've established some tremendous functional support systems in place. We've put a newer ERP customer relationship management program, new HR systems. We didn't have these six and seven years ago. We've got them in place. We got them debug. We've got them operating.","So we're just much more effective at running our business and not spending as much time as putting new systems in and new processes in place. So I think we know where we can become more efficient. I think we've always been very effective, but now it's all about efficiency gains and harvesting all the investments we've made in better operating systems and better IT systems.","And third, we have some far better talent running the business, virtually every mine and chemical plant has a new leader in place over the last five years and some real talent has risen to the top. So we will see these improvements hit the bottomline.","And another difference is we've been very specific about and very detailed about where the savings are going to come from. The business unit leaders have each, potash, phosphate functional leadership and they're all committed to very specific savings and a time line to achieve that we might not have been so detailed and specific in the past. Good questions, Mark. We've got time for two more questions. Operator?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC.","Jacob Bout - CIBC","My question is on your U.S. potash strategy. And if I remember, if we go back to your last Analyst Day, you talked about increasing market share there and talked about the strength of distribution. Just wondering what your thoughts are currently and especially if you think about the ramp up of [indiscernible] here that's going to happen over the next 12 to 18 months? And then maybe your thoughts on the sustainability of premium potash pricing in the U.S. going forward?","James Prokopanko","Good to here from you, Jacob. It seems like it's been a while since we've chatted. The two questions you're asking about what we see or you asked about market share that we had a plan to increase share in North America. I'm not so sure that it was a plan to increase share as to increase our returns and our profitability in North America and that's what drives us. Market share, yes, it's an important, but it doesn't add to EPS by just having more market share if you can't do that with the greater gross margin.","And I'm going to have Rick talk to that. We've had a good quarter. Our program of exclusive space and supply contracts and early placement of potash, the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter served us well this year. We've seen a nice increase in our uptick in sales of potash. I'm going to ask now to turn it over to Rick to talk about just that market shares and then let him address the premium pricing in North America over international pricing.","Richard McLellan","As we think about our programs into the North American market, our warehousing agreements are working just fine. And they've allowed us to position product as we saw in the first quarter ahead of demand, which is exactly the way we described it as we rolled it out. And that's worked for both phosphates and potash.","So we're really quite comfortable with those agreements as they go forward and it helps us make sure that our customers are properly served. I think the surprise that everyone had in distribution is the fact of how serious this winters impact was on the rail systems and that's yet to play itself out, but we feel very good about those warehousing agreements.","The second question is one that we look at. And on the premium for prices versus international, I think that as you think about it, North America was always the highest price market in the world, Europe has passed that now, and both have something in common. They are granular markets that have distribution businesses that don't buy in vessel quantities. They buy in railcar and train quantities, some times truck.","And so the issue that we see there is there should a premium in North America from a logistic standpoint. And because there is imports coming to the center Gulf, the price reflected in North America when you back away the freight, net backs to those international producers at a price that's very much equal to delivered Brazil. And we've talked about that before and we just have to remind ourselves that the North American and European markets are true granular markets.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse.","Tom Ackerman - Credit Suisse","This is actually Tom filling in for Chris. So looking at the phosphate market based on what you see in the preliminary basis, would you have expected India to have been a little bit more active thus far? I understand they've picked up, but are you seeing any sort of acceleration?","Richard McLellan","Just coming back from India about two weeks ago, I got a flavor for what was happening there. Right now we're seeing them stepping in to buy tons. And so the things that are driving that are, first, the government have put out and published the subsidy rules and pricing for P&K and nitrogen. So that led to them stepping in.","And secondly, is that India will get served by tons coming from China and from the Middle East first. And those contracts are going into place now. We expect India to import through the year between 5 million tons and 5.1 million tons of DAP. And we expect in this period from arrivals from July through November, which means shipments from June through October that they will purchase 4 million tons. They've yet to step in to buy that amount of tons and it's because they're becoming a spot market.","The one real positive is that last year when we were in this period, we saw a weakening trend in the rupee and ahead of this year's election, you've got a rupee that's at 60 to the U.S. dollar, which is much stronger than it was last year, which frankly is going to be one of the drivers that leads to increased demand in India.","James Prokopanko","Rick, I'm just going to add one other item. And that's what we've seen developed recently is the Indians differentiating pricing based on quality. China has been growing, we've said a couple of times have grown their phosphate market and it's a real grab bag of quality. There is some very good quality and there is a lot of very poor quality, low nutrient content, lower than normal nutrient contents and a poor granularity in the product. The Indians now are differentiating and they're calling out various tonnages that they are looking for by quality. So Mosaic being a high quality phosphate supplier, I think is leaving us in a good position and giving us a competitive advantage.","And with that that's going to conclude our call. I'd like to reiterate our key themes for this morning. First, despite the external challenges, Mosaic continues to deliver solid results. And I'd just like to call out, here we are at a cyclical trough we believe and we are posting very strong operating cash flows of $627 million this quarter. And I think that's up over last year and has been about close to eight quarters since we posted that kind of a number.","Second, we've taken advantage of the downward part of the cycle to make great investments and financial progress in our strategy and in our balance sheet. From joint venture in Saudi Arabia, and acquisitions we've made in the Florida and in Brazil, to major share repurchases and our significant effort that's now being applied to reducing cost, Mosaic really is making some strong moves and delivering on what we have said that we would do in the past.","And finally, our strategic and financial strength of Mosaic, positioned to accelerate as the cycle turns upward. We're achieving our vision to become the world's leading crop nutrition company. And I'll just make out a strong point that we have our assets in some of the most stable, politically stable, economically stable markets in the world, countries in the world, Canada and the U.S., rule of law assured, reliable operations that our customers are coming to appreciate in this day and age more and more.","With that, I'm going to thank you all for joining us this morning. And please, have a great and safe day. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Our first quarter press release, performance data, and earnings slides available on our website contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","Joc O'Rourke","Thank you, Laura, and good morning to you all.","Mosaic delivered another strong quarter to wrap up a year of good results and accelerating momentum. We accomplished a great deal in 2018. We transformed the business in Brazil, improved our cost base in Phosphates, made major strides toward completing our Esterhazy K3 potash mine, delivered record potash production, and reached a new milestone in premium product sales.","All these accomplishments allowed us to capture the full benefit of improving market conditions. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made and we're optimistic regarding 2019. Our announcement today that we will double our annual dividend target reflects our first step toward increasing capital returns to shareholders.","For the fourth quarter, Mosaic reported earnings of $0.29 per share and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 per share, which represents over a 100% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.","Adjusted earnings for the quarter include a $21 million benefit, approximately $0.05 per share from the reduction of the full year estimated tax rate for 2018. Net sales increased by $429 million to $2.5 billion over a year ago.","Our full-year 2018 results reflect positive market dynamics and solid execution across the business. For the year, revenues increased by 29% to $9.6 billion. We reported net earnings of $470 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, a 68% increase over a year ago.","Net earnings per share were $1.22 compared to a loss in 2017. And adjusted earnings per share increased over 90% to $2.12 per share.","I would like to provide some detail on our 2018 accomplishments. We successfully integrated and substantially transformed the Vale Fertilizantes business. in fact Mosaic Fertilizantes delivered $227 million in operating earnings and $410 million in adjusted EBITDA in the year, compared with pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $81 million in 2017.","One of the primary factors driving this turnaround is the pace at which the team in Brazil is realizing synergies. We realized $158 million of net synergies in 2018, with a run-rate exceeding $280 million at year-end. We now expect to reach our net synergy target in 2019, a full year ahead of schedule.","The Potash team delivered record production for both the quarter and the full year. We made major progress on the new Esterhazy K3 project, including the recent commissioning of the first production hoist and conveyor to the K2 mill. Our engineers have developed a path to accelerate development at K3 by a full year and now we expect to be able to eliminate brine management costs entirely by 2024.","In Phosphates, the transformation of the business is delivering meaningful financial and operational benefits as well as creating significant savings and deferral of capital spending, without sacrificing safety, mechanical integrity or reserve life.","We shipped a record 3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials including over 1 million tonnes to Brazil. Our sales of MicroEssentials continues to grow. In fact, companywide, our sales have grown at a compound rate of 18% over the past 10 years and Brazil sales have grown even faster with a compound annual rate of 41% albeit from a smaller base. We expect to add capacity through debottlenecking and potential additional facility conversions as demand continues to grow.","We announced another important milestone during the fourth quarter. We received the final permit for our Ona mine site. The mine gives us access to a large reserve and helps to extend Florida Phosphate mining for decades to come. We plan to mine these reserves with existing assets, including the South Pasture facility, minimizing the need for new capital spending and highlighting one of the primary benefits of our acquisition of CF Industries' phosphate business.","Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we generated another year of record safety performance. Even as we push to reduce cost and integrate our largest acquisition ever, all of us at Mosaic are proud of the trajectory of our safety performance, steady improvement year-by-year for the past eight years.","Overall, 2018 was a year of remarkable progress and strong results and we expect to realize further benefit from our strategic successes and good markets in 2019. We expect global supply and demand to remain balanced for both phosphates and potash in the year ahead. While the channel appears to be well stocked around the world, in part due to a weak fall application season in North America, we expect inventories to be draw down quickly and strong demand to emerge as we move through North American spring and as the season picks up in Brazil. New supply in both phosphates and potash has been slow to come to market and that trend is continuing in 2019.","This slow global supply ramp-up has allowed demand to catch up and keep potash and phosphate markets balanced. We continue to watch political and trade developments around the world as well as Chinese phosphate exports, which we believe will continue to follow the economics.","Now I will turn the call over to Clint to discuss our segments, capital, and our guidance for the first quarter and for the year.","Clint Freeland","Thank you. Joc. Good morning, everyone.","As noted earlier, Mosaic finished the year with a strong fourth quarter generating $590 million in adjusted EBITDA and $0.77 a share in adjusted earnings per share, bringing full-year adjusted EBITDA to $2.029 billion and adjusted earnings per share to $2.12, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. All three business units performed well and contributed to this outcome.","And Mosaic Fertilizantes' adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $133 million compared to pro forma fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $13 million as the business continued to benefit from strong selling prices, synergy realizations, wider distribution margins and favorable foreign exchange rates.","Gross margin per tonne for the business during the quarter was $56, well above the top end of our expected range of $35 to $45 as the distribution business not only exceeded sales expectations, but delivered a higher margin mix of sales during the quarter, in part due to high MicroEssentials sales volumes.","As demonstrated in the results, the team in Brazil has made great progress and its synergy capture program. In addition to the $158 million in net realized synergies noted earlier, Mosaic Fertilizantes realized an additional $21 million in benefits from executing its business-to-business marketing strategy, which allowed us to keep our selling prices at or above replacement costs.","As revenue synergies were not included when we set our original synergy targets and ranges, we wanted to remain consistent in our reporting and note them separately. But make no mistake, these benefits are real and they are contributing to the financial results of the business.","Similar to Mosaic Fertilizantes, the Phosphates segment delivered a very strong fourth quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $219 million versus $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. While sale volumes were down compared to last year as a result of the Plant City idling, results improved as higher average stripping margins offset the sales decline.","Gross margin per tonne for the Phosphates segment totaled $81, comfortably exceeding our guidance. These higher margins were driven primarily by product mix. We sold more product to higher netback regions and a higher proportion of premium MicroEssentials products than we originally forecasted. Margins also benefited from several relatively small normal course but infrequent items that together added approximately $5 a tonne during the quarter.","The Potash segment also generated strong results for the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $256 million compared to $155 million in the same quarter last year as higher market prices and continued cost management efforts led to the improvement. Of note, during the quarter was the extraordinary operational performance of the potash fleet, which recorded a 99% operating rate during the period.","The Company continues to focus on managing costs and has made tremendous progress when measured by SG&A per tonne. To further enhance our focus in this area and better align reporting cost with accountability and decision-making, we've determined that certain corporate costs that are not controllable by the business should no longer be allocated to the operating segments and should instead be reported in the Corporate segment.","Not only should this increase visibility and improve accountability for managing these costs, but it should also give investors a clearer view of true segment level cost and margins. We will make this reporting change beginning in the first quarter and we'll recast prior quarters and updated performance data that we'll post to our website before our next earnings.","Before moving on to our expectations for 2019, there is one more financial reporting topic, I would like to comment on. As noted in our press release, we completed our year-end close process which went relatively smoothly.","However, because of the size and complexities of the purchase accounting related to our acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes, which included 54,000 assets, we are continuing to work on the allocation of value, the documentation related to that allocation process, and our evaluation of internal control effectiveness.","Since we need additional time to complete this work, we will file a Form 12 b-25, which would allow us an additional 15 days to file our 2018 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon filing within the prescribed deadline, the Company's Form 10-K will be deemed to be timely filed. We do not expect that the results reported to you today will differ in any material respect from those presented in our 2018 Form 10-K.","Our outlook for full-year 2019 reflects our expectation for continued strength in our core markets and progress on the various transformation efforts around the Company. As reflected on Slide 11 of the presentation, we are initiating our full-year 2019 guidance with an adjusted EBITDA range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, and an adjusted earnings per share range of $2.10 to $2.50.","There are many assumptions that have gone into our estimates, some of which we've outlined on Slide 14 in the appendix of this presentation. There are a few others that I would note. First, finished product and raw material product pricing expectations are based on visible and anticipated prices as of mid-February.","Second, as Joc noted earlier, we expect to achieve our full synergy target in 2019. So we have included $275 million in net synergies in our guidance. Turning to K3, the commissioning of the first hoist and conveyor at the site means that the mine is now being accounted for as a production facility.","As a result, some costs of underground development are no longer capitalized but are being added to operating cost. These costs total $25 million to $30 million in 2019. Given the relatively modest incremental tonnage being produced in this development phase, we expect our production cost per tonne for the business segment to be approximately $3 per tonne higher than it otherwise would be. This is transient however, and is expected to be de minimis by 2021.","Next, based on a comprehensive peer review comparing our definition of adjusted EBITDA to those used by both competitors and others more broadly, we have decided to update our definition to exclude both non-cash ARO accretion expense and equity settled incentive compensation beginning January 1st 2019.","Our guidance for 2019 includes an estimated $60 million benefit from this change. For comparative purposes, the historical performance data will be republished to reflect this change as well as the SG&A allocation change I mentioned earlier.","And finally, as is normal in our business, we expect to see a degree of seasonality in our business this year with more modest earnings in the first quarter and more robust earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters. With the weak fall application season and the impact that has had on phosphate inventory channels and finished product prices, we expect a more pronounced seasonal effect on earnings in this first quarter than in prior years.","While we've also seen a reduction in raw material prices, which should provide an offsetting benefit, this is expected to take one to two quarters to be realized through our cost of goods sold, ultimately benefiting results in future quarters.","With adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, the Company expects to generate significant cash flow in 2019. Cash interest expense is estimated at approximately $160 million, and we anticipate paying roughly $60 million in cash taxes, primarily in Brazil and Canada. Sustaining CapEx is targeted at $720 million and is in line with historic guidance of $500 million to $600 million per year for the phosphate and potash businesses and approximately $150 million for Mosaic Fertilizantes. Longer term, we would expect consolidated sustaining capital to remain consistent with these historic ranges at around $650 million to $750 million annually.","Assuming that working capital nets out over the course of the year, the Company should have $1.26 billion to $1.46 billion in allocable cash during 2019. Current capital allocation commitments to-date include, first, the stock common stock dividend, which we are targeting at $0.20 a share, up from $0.10 per share.","Second, K3 Mine development and acceleration. It's important to note here that the capital budget for the mine remains unchanged, but that annual spend has increased due to the accelerated schedule. In addition, these numbers include increasing compaction capacity to allow us to achieve higher margins from our production.","Third, Florida mine life extension projects that will not only extend the resource life for our phosphate business, but will also allow us to avoid over $1 billion in future capital spend previously thought necessary.","Fourth, approximately $50 million in low-risk, high-return organic investments, 70% of which pay for themselves within two years. In total, $560 million in capital has been allocated to these items, leaving $700 million to $900 million in cash available to be allocated this year.","With that said, it's important to note that the vast majority of this cash will be generated in the second half of this year given the seasonality of the business and that we would anticipate being somewhat measured in our capital deployment in the near term as we monitor developments in Brazil with respect to the recently passed new rules and regulations and assess how they may affect us.","And as we've said in the past, our objective is to execute a balanced capital allocation program that promotes the growth and resiliency of the business through continued strengthening of the balance sheet, investments in projects that generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns and provides a regular return of capital to shareholders.","With that, I'll ask Joc for his closing comments.","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks Clint.","I will close by reiterating our premise for today. Mosaic delivered strong results in the fourth quarter and for the full year because markets improved and most importantly because the actions we have taken to create a resilient and efficient franchise that has built substantial earnings leverage.","We are proud of our progress and we will not stop pushing for further strategic improvements. I would like to note that we will host our Analyst Day in Tampa on March 28. We plan to provide you with more detail on our strategy and outlook as well as more specifics on Esterhazy K3, Mosaic Fertilizantes and our domestic phosphate rock strategy.","Now, before we open it up to Q&A, I would like to address a question that maybe on many of your minds. What are we doing in Brazil and what are the implications to our business following the Vale's Feijao iron ore mine disaster?","First of all, I'd like to share our deepest sympathy with those impacted by this catastrophe. Our immediate reaction upon hearing of the dam failure was to offer medical teams and other assistance to Vale. We have a close relationship with Vale. Many of our Brazilian employees are former Vale employees, and Vale is one of our largest shareholders. Our thoughts are with them as they deal with this very difficult situation.","Now, I will briefly discuss Mosaic's efforts following the dam collapse. On Monday, February the 18th, new regulations went into effect in Brazil to address the safety of tailings dams and other mining and processing waste storage structure.","Mosaic has 22 such structures in Brazil, 11 of which are tailings dams. In light of the new regulations and after conferring with independent experts, we believe that 21 of our 22 structures are compliant with the new safety regulations, although, two of these dams have upstream lifts that require remediation plans.","One tailings dam at our Araxa facility does not appear to meet the new safety standard for undrained resistance. While the dam was in compliance under the old criteria, we had already been making improvements to the dam to increase our margin of safety.","We proactively reported the potential issue to the ANM, the agency that regulates dams in Brazil, and after consultation with the ANM, we've agreed to keep the line out of operation until we can improve the dam's undrained safety factor.","All of our other 21 structures have current certificates of stability issued by external consultants. In addition, the Company has arranged for an independent third-party assessment of all of our dams, which is expected to be complete in approximately 90 days.","I would also note that none of our tailings dams utilize the upstream method of construction that was apparently used in the construction of dams that failed in the Samarco and Feijao incidents. We have two dams at our center line construction, but have small final upstream lifts. We are assessing remediation requirements for those dams.","While there is uncertainty about the future requirements that the Brazilian Government may impose on miners and on tailings dams, we believe change is necessary and will only make mining in Brazil safer and more sustainable for the future. At Mosaic, we have made the safety of our employees, our communities and the environment, a very high priority and we will continue to do so, no matter where we operate.","Now, let's turn the line over to take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","Just wanted to drill a little bit more into the Fertilizantes business. Your near-term gross margin per tonne expectations are roughly the same for your phosphate business and the Fertilizantes business in this $40 to $50 a tonne range. Is it fair to assume that the legacy distribution business that you have that's in that Fertilizantes business is kind of in that range of $20 to $30 a tonne margins that you had historically and therefore is your - the domestic phosphate operation down there is now significantly more profitable, maybe closer to $80 a tonne margins?","Joc O'Rourke","Certainly, the legacy distribution business had the margins in the range of $20 to $30 per tonne. And so, yes, the production business would be expected and certainly does have higher margins. We're not separating those out per se anymore, but what I can tell you is the synergy capture not only involved improving the production business or the B2B business, but there was also a great deal of synergy between those two, which we wouldn't be able to attribute specifically to either one of them. But what we have seen is improvements in gross margin for that distribution business because of the synergies and the go-to-market strategy that we've undertaken.","Steve Byrne","Does that combination of synergies benefiting both sides of that business warrant further expansion in capacity in either the domestic production or in distribution given the increased profitability?","Joc O'Rourke","Certainly, we will look at that very carefully as one of our opportunities for growth. We believe, we've built a platform there, but it does have long-term growth potential. As you are all aware, the Brazil growth in agriculture has been one of the best in the world and it continues to be one of the most attractive areas and so we believe we can grow with that market.","Steve Byrne","And then just lastly on that is this the key driver to those synergies, just simply headcount reduction or is it really more process-related where you can modify the operations down there based on partnering your knowledge from your North American operations?","Joc O'Rourke","The synergies come from a number of areas. Certainly headcount is one of them, but the use of - more effective use of contractors, supply chain and logistics, procurement, and as I say, just the taking advantage of Mosaic's market strategy has improved the ability of both to capture new margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jeremy on for Vincent. I just want to dig a bit deeper in the first quarter guidance. Seems just a bit light at first glance. Are you expecting to gain back any of those applications lost in the fall in the first quarter? Are you kind of expecting some of that back in the second quarter? And just maybe as a follow-up to that, is that kind of leading to the discussion in the press release about the need to sort of export more product to kind of move away from that North American market? I'm - just more color there would be helpful. Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Look, I'm going to tag team this with Karen. But the Q1 guidance - look, I think there's a couple of things that are at the top of my mind. The first is, we had a great sales season or a good sales season in the fall from the Mosaic perspective in that we sold the volume we expected to sell.","However, we do not think there was a great application season in North America because of the weather and the product that we - that is likely in customer warehouses today.","So what that means is that at least our winter-fill will likely be weaker than usual. The other thing that happened to us in the fourth quarter I think is prices held better through the fourth quarter than probably our original guidance would have expected. So now that that prices decreased, we expect we will see the next wave of selling at a lower - a slightly lower price, which is why that first quarter is slightly weaker.","We fully expect that the spring season will make up some of the fourth quarter application loss, and so by the end of the first half, we feel we will largely be whole. Karen, do you want to add anything to that?","Karen Swager","Jeremy, see, it looks like the prices take a negative turn almost every winter season, as we've noted before. This year's price declines occurred a little bit later than usual, as Joc said, but they were more significant for a couple of reasons. We had that disappointing fall application season in North America due to weather although we had shipped a normal amount of product into the system and that resulted in the North American distribution channel, that is really quite full.","On top of that, we received an excessive level of imports into the U.S. River System and so there's quite a bit of product available for spring. We do think that you'll see this normalize through first half of '19, but potentially not in the first quarter. Demand is strong and we think that at least 80% of what was not applied in the fall will get applied in the spring.","So we're anticipating really strong shipments for spring season. And as long as we get normal weather and can avoid any logistics hang-ups with that big of a season, we believe we should see a recovery by the end of the second quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Karen, I think the other thing is the cost of goods sold and the raw materials movement. Can you may give us some color on how the raw materials, particularly sulfur and ammonia, are moving through our products right now?","Karen Swager","Yes, absolutely. I think that's another good point for first quarter. So we have seen our industry benchmark stripping margin, which you've heard us talk about before, is down. Our actual margins that are anticipated in the first quarter that we've guided to are a little bit more negatively impacted and that's due to the raw materials. Given the level of inventories in the system, it will take a little bit longer for these raw material price decreases to work through the system and impact overall margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard","I was curious about your capital allocation. It looks like you're projecting a pretty sizable pile of cash burning out a hole in your balance sheet there. How are you thinking about deploying that? And can you talk a little bit about the trade-offs between buybacks, more dividends and M&A?","Joc O'Rourke","Thank you, Jonas, and yes, I'm going to hand this over to Clint in a second here, but what I would like to start by saying is our approach to capital allocation is unchanged. We will continue to have a disciplined and balanced approach to allocating capital in a way that helps grow our Company and invest in high-return investment opportunities, both internal and external, balanced with strengthening the resiliency of our balance sheet, and of course, returning money to shareholders, our doubling of our dividend is actually a very good example of that this year. Client, you want to talk a little about that?","Clint Freeland","You know, first, as you noted, I think we expect to generate a significant amount of cash this year based on our guidance, we pegged that at $1.26 billion to $1.46 billion of allocable cash - excuse me, and based on kind of what we've outlined between the dividend in K3 and other things, we've allocated about 40% of that leaving about 60% of that cash available for allocation later in the year. I would note though that given the seasonality of our business and how we expect things to play out that the vast majority of that cash would be generated in the second half of this year.","So I think we certainly want to be measured in the timing of decisions, but - of actually deploying that cash. But as we've talked about in the past, I think what we want to do is to execute a balanced capital allocation program, very similar to what Joc just said, where we continue to put downward pressure on our debt levels over time.","We invest in high risk-adjusted return opportunities as they present themselves. But then also continue to return capital to shareholders and the dividend increase this morning is again just the first step in that.","As we think about dividend share buybacks and M&A, you know one of the things that I think we always need to keep top of mind is particularly around M&A versus share buybacks is that we need to be sure that any type of M&A investment beats the share buyback, and we need to be sure that we always have that tension in that analytical approach.","So I would say, as we think about returning capital to shareholders, there are obviously different options that are available, we'll continue to evaluate that, and then again as we look at any type of M&A, we also want to be sure that that's a better alternative for us than buying back shares.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","I have two questions. China exports of phosphate were 11 million tonnes in 2018. What do you think they'll be in 2019? And in your potash slide, you have Other Asia going from 5.2 million tonnes of demand 5.5 million tonnes to 5.8 million tonnes. Which countries are you thinking of to encompass that increase in demand?","Joc O'Rourke","I'm going to hand this straight over to Mike, but before I do, I just would like to acknowledge, Mike, this will be his last Mosaic's earnings call. He will - he has announced his retirement and will retire in April of this year. As many of you know, Mike has served Mosaic and its predecessors for over 33 years and I think it's fair to say that he is a real industry icon. He has been an invaluable resource for many of you, and of course, a very invaluable resource to all of us here at Mosaic. So, Mike, I want to thank you and wish you all the best for the future and retirement. And this is also the first Mosaic's earnings call for Andy Jung.","Andy came to Mosaic in 2013 to bolster our Market & Strategic Analysis function and he is an accomplished agricultural economist and he has a long history of analyzing this industry. Prior to Mosaic, he spent a decade at a leading industry analysis firm. So you can look forward to his insights on the market and the industry in the years ahead. So Mike and Andy, can you talk about this question?","Michael Rahm","One comment I would make before answering the infamous China export question is that I'm very pleased with our succession plan. I think all of you know, Andy, you know that he's a lot taller, a lot thinner and a lot smarter than I am. So I'm very pleased that the Market & Strategic Analysis function at Mosaic is going to be in very good hands. And the other thing I would say about retirement is it's a bit bittersweet in the sense that I think Mosaic's future is extremely bright and I guess bright for three reasons, one, I think we've made some great strategic moves over the last five or six years.","Secondly, the transformation or optimization initiatives are really taking hold and delivering results to the bottom line. And I think there are a lot more results to come. And then finally, when we look at the market outlook, I'm still very constructive on the medium, and long-term outlook for this industry. So I won't be in the game, but I'll be on the sidelines cheering all of you on.","So let's get to the China question. As Jeff indicated, the numbers you know the numbers that China exports of DAP, MAP and TSP were up about 900,000 tonnes last year. MAP was up 1.1 million tonnes - or DAP was up 1.1 million tonnes, MAP was down a couple of hundred thousand tons. If you look at the trade flows, Indian DAP imports were up 2 million tonnes.","So the increase in China's DAP exports directly related to the big increase in Indian imports. And then secondly, despite the fact that exports were up, we do think there are some real significant transitions taking place in the Chinese industry. We know that new taxes and regulations took hold last year, we think that has increased production cost $10 to $15 per tonne. So it's lifted the entire industry cost curve.","Secondly, we know rock production this year is down 25% to 30%. As a consequence, a lot of the formerly integrated producers are now non-integrated producers, so you've really had a big increase in the upper end of the cost curve. So there are a lot of changes taking place, and we do think current prices in China are close to marginal cost.","So with all that said, I'll get to your question, how much do we think they will export? We think it will be less in 2019 than 2018. I think I'm going to dish off the second question to Andy, in terms of the increase in Other Asian imports.","Andy Jung","Thank you, Mike. So it's fairly broad-based across Asia, there are a few pockets of weather concern, but by and large expectations are for a fairly normal monsoon season throughout Australasia. So you - looking across or going down the list, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, especially with the recent - rebound in palm oil pricing, so we are fairly confident that Other Asia, which has really shown, albeit from a relatively smaller base than some of the big countries in Asia, has shown very strong growth over the last several years and that growth will continue into '20 - or through 2019, also assisted by a relatively low carrying inventory levels in that region.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.","Duffy Fischer","I was wondering if you could give a little bit more - I think it was Clint talked about the $5 a ton in phosphate, was that truly a one-time fourth quarter only issue and so kind of it stops Jan 1 or does some of that bleed through into the first half of this year?","Clint Freeland","I think as we look at it, that $5 a tonne, we're not forecasting any of that to come into first quarter. Just to give you a flavor for kind of what makes that up. We look at - we have kind of this category that we call other sales, but it's a little bit of sulfuric acid, a little bit of extra ammonia, and some scrap, kind of things that are kind of in the ordinary course relatively small, but we saw that in the fourth quarter, we also had some insurance proceeds that came back to us for the sulfur enterprise work, we had previously had some, some expense associated with some fire damage that did run through gross margin per tonne in the previous quarter, we got a little bit of insurance proceeds back in the fourth quarter.","So again, that wouldn't reoccur. And so there are a couple of - just a handful of kind of small things that happened in the ordinary course of business, but we really would not expect them to flow through to Q1.","Joc O'Rourke","And I just emphasize that normally in the fourth quarter, you see these same small items tend to be negative. And this year, surprisingly they were positive.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens.","Mark Connelly","You talked about Miski Mayo rock driving your costs up a little bit. Can you give us a sense of what the opportunity looks like to get those costs down and what needs to happen or what targets you have there? And maybe related to that, you signed an MOU with a Chinese buyer, and it's not clear whether that's going to be geared toward rock or finished goods. Can you give us any sort of sense of how meaningful you think that's going to be in 2019 or going forward?","Joc O'Rourke","Mark, let me start by saying, I think you're referring to the increase in cost because the proportion of Miski Mayo rock was higher in our COGS this quarter. And you have to understand that when we bring Miski Mayo rock and we have not only the operating cost but the added cost of transport from through into our existing business, but if I look at Miski Mayo itself, I think there is a really great story there in terms of the integration as we take over the joint venture. This year, we had record low costs at Miski Mayo, record volumes at Miski Mayo, and a record safety performance at that operation.","So over time, we believe that we can make material improvements to how that Miski Mayo works. In terms of our China MOU, I'm going to hand that over to Karen to give a couple of comments about our ongoing relationship there.","Karen Swager","Yes, we signed an MOU with Sinochem organization this fall. And there are no specific volumes stated, we do believe that there will be future opportunities for rock imports into China given the rationalization of the rock mining that is starting to occur as we said about 25% to 30% rock production has decreased in China and over time, some of that rock maybe replaced at plants that are not relocated or closed in the future. So that's the intent of that agreement, but there are no specific volumes listed for 2019.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Alex Falcao with HSBC.","Alex Falcao","Just going back to Brazil, if you may. So we saw that there is this deadline for August 15th for - for other dams to be adopted to the new regulation. It seems like the industry is fighting back a little bit that be it all those - those data points or at least that date. Can you - what happens - first, can you - can you have a plan in place and have all your dams adopted to that point? First question.","Second question is, what happens if - there is - if some of the players are not able to do that and what do you expect in terms of shutting down some of these upstream dams and what is the impact of those closures if they were to happen? Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Alex, look, I'm going to hand this over to Rick. Rick is on the phone from Brazil right now, Rick McLellan, our business leader in Brazil. But before I do that, just I think the first clarification is by August 15th, the new legislation requirement, if I understand it correctly, and I will get Rick to clarify further, is that we need to have a plan in place or that anybody who has an upstream dam needs to have a plan in place. I do not believe that's the adoption date.","I believe the adoption date is a couple of years later, but I will allow clarification from Rick and I will get him to give you the - what he would expect to be the impact if they can't comply. Rick, can I ask you guys to look at this?","Richard McLellan","Yes Joc, well, first things first. You're right that the plan has to be in place and presented in August and then there's a time schedule for it to take place. I think from an industry standpoint, people believe this needs to take place, this - these type of changes need to take place. I think there will be a question about the time allowed to make it happen. But to be honest, the new legislation came into place last Monday, and yesterday, there was a new set of state legislations for the state of Minas Gerais.","And so, the industry is trying to work its way through it as are we. And it - and if - my sense is, if you don't meet the agreed upon criteria, those dams are - have to be decommissioned and taken out of - taken out of operation. I'm not sure I fully answered, but that's - that's about what everybody knows today.","Joc O'Rourke","Rick, I'm just going to highlight again all that, because of the recentness of this event, I think the legislative impacts will be in somewhat flux for a period of time, Alex. I don't think we're going to have final answers for a period of time, and look, when we do understand what the legislation is, we will make sure that as a Company, we fully comply and that we follow whatever the highest standard to protect the employees, the communities, and the environment around and where we work.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.","Andrew Wong","So I just want to go back to phos rock costs. Earlier in 2018, they were down to about $35 per tonne, but looks like they're back up a little bit to around like to $40 per tonne range. So how much of that is Miski Mayo versus like other operating items and what can we expect going forward for overall phos rock costs?","Joc O'Rourke","Okay, Andrew. Thank you. The $35 a tonne rock cost you referred to is the - I believe you're referring to the cash cost of Florida mined rock. That varies and I think it is up this quarter because we're in areas that maybe have a little lower grade, a little further to pump, and that's normal variance, which we expect to see in our business as we move from deposit to deposit, mine to mine and in different areas. The overall rock cost then would include the Miski Mayo cost.","But what I can say is, overall and allowing for that variance, our transformation efforts have given us great success. I think those rock costs have been held relatively flat for eight years now. And so I think that is a great testament to the amount of work that's done. Now I think as we go forward, we expect to see some increases at least with inflation and longer pumping distances, but we are looking at how we mitigate those costs every year. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.","Don Carson","I just wanted to take advantage of Mike's last call just to get his views on potash supply outlook. I know on Slide 16 you've given your demand view. But how do you see some of these ramps of new capacity affecting the supply demand balances and prices in as we get into the second half of 2019?","Joc O'Rourke","And certainly in respect to you and both Mike, I will definitely allow that to go to Mike, although, I'm sure Andy could give an equally eloquent answer.","Michael Rahm","We haven't changed our view a whole lot. Obviously, there are a few puts and takes on the supply side. And before addressing those, I think you have to acknowledge the tremendous growth that has taken place on the demand side. And potash demand has been a great story. If you look at shipments in 2017, up almost 5 million tonnes, 2018, we followed that big step-up with another 1 million tonne increase. So we're talking about a very robust demand environment.","Flipping to the supply side, as we said, puts and takes. If you look at some of the takes, the Boulby mine closed mid-year. In Chile, SQM is focusing very hard on maximizing lithium production at the expense of KCl. K plus S had a few problems in the Werra region. China production has flattened after tremendous growth over the past 10 years.","So that - in that context, we - and going ahead this year, we'll see another mine closure at Saskatchewan and in the context of good demand growth, some few hiccups on the supply side, and the expectation of a normal ramp-up of new capacity, certainly, the situation for 2019 looks very well balanced to actually a bit of a deficit. When we look at the changes in our S&D, we're showing a small deficit, which again, we don't think the world's going to run out of potash, but all it indicates is that we think producers are going have to run at high rates.","And if you look at what's happened this past year, record production at Mosaic, record production Belaruskali, record production coming from some of the facilities at ICL. The supply side needs to respond to the robust demand environment, coupled with a few other changes on the supply side with other producers. No, no change in our view, I think the potash outlook looks - continues to look very positive. Andy, any concluding comments?","Andy Jung","No, I think you summed it up well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Chris Parkinson","So, you touched on your view that new supply will come online at a moderated pace, enabling demand to keep up, but can you just further hit on your view of global trade flow evolution, just given the vast majority of the new suppliers from the Middle East and North Africa. Is it safe to presume that you'll be selling even less into Central Asia and more into Latin America over the intermediate to long-term? Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks, Chris. I'm going to hand this back to Andy and Mike again to just discuss that.","Michael Rahm","Maybe Andy, why don't you give a first shot and I'll add any color.","Andy Jung","Well, we've stated before that we are certainly more Americas focused with our asset base that's located in the Americas and we took the decision several years ago to move away from supplying our Indian distribution business out of Florida and primarily serving it with MWSPC tonnes out of Saudi Arabia and we would expect that that pattern will persist.","In terms of new production capability in the phosphate space, one would expect that OCP and Ma'aden or derivation of joint ventures in Saudi Arabia will meet much of future demand growth and you won't see new capacity out of North America in particular. So servicing global demand in the Asian region is most definitely going to be serviced from North Africa and the Middle East.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi.","Dan Jester","It's Dan Jester on for PJ. So, in North America, today, where are inventories more challenged given - compared to a normal year? Is it in potash or in phosphate? And then secondly, in your demand forecast for North America I think you have potash shipments falling for a second consecutive year. Any comments on that would be helpful too. Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Sorry, I missed the second half of your question, Dan. I got the inventory challenge in P and K but I missed --","Dan Jester","North America potash shipments, you have been down for the second consecutive year in 2019. Can you just maybe talk about what's driving that? Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","I'm going to share this question with Karen, but let me say, if I look at North American inventory, both P and K were affected by the poor than average to the ground actual usage. But I think if you look at it, I think the potash impact was probably a little less than the phosphate. So there's a bigger buildup of phosphate inventory and with imports that's probably exacerbated a little bit. Karen, do you want to talk about that and the --","Karen Swager","I think the situation that Joc summarized is valid. There is a little bit more phosphate inventory potentially in the hands of distributors and a little bit more the potash inventory in hands of the producers. Both nutrients though suffered the same impact from the fall - disappointing fall application season. And so it's more of an issue of in whose hands that inventory is held.","Overall, globally, I think we have probably seen most of the price impact that we're going to see happen on the phosphate side because we're seeing some turnaround in some of the things such as production curtailments or shutdowns in Australia, Mexico, China helping phosphates and on the potash side, I think you've got less of a global buildup in inventories outside of North America.","On the second part of the question on North American K shipments, I'm going to turn it over to Andy.","Andy Jung","For North American potash shipments, frankly, we'd see the market as pretty flat, while we show a small decline, that's within the margin for error in our shipment forecast. We expect on-farm demand to remain robust, corn acres likely will be higher, 92 million acres is our current point estimate. So I would look at it more as a flat demand in North America.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Bria Murphy","This is Bria Murphy on for Joel Jackson. Thanks for taking my question. Just on MicroEssentials, it performed well over the last number of quarters, but you spoke in the past about production limitations there. I know you mentioned in your opening remarks that you're working on addressing these limitations. So if you could elaborate on that? And then how do you expect to continue to drive growth post the patent expiry there? Thanks.","Joc O'Rourke","Let me say, first of all, we produced over 3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials and sold almost 3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials last year, which means we are getting very close to the 3.5 million tonnes of overall capacity. The way we will address that is, we are now looking at debottlenecking opportunities.","And as you get close to 85%-90%, which is where we are of existing capacity, seasonality becomes more of an issue, so we are looking at how we can debottleneck and then we will after that look at what would be the next capital investment required to move MicroEssentials up. I'm going to let Karen talk a little bit about the patent and growth after that.","Karen Swager","Joc addressed the growth opportunities potentially debottlenecking to try and get that capacity expanded beyond the 3.5 million tonne capacity today. The other thing that we can do to get beyond the levels we're at is talk about impacting the seasonality for this product, and so we are working on a number of things, moving products into our distribution systems, into storage space to be able to spread out that production and help overcome that seasonality factor and potentially get that operating rate up all the way to its capacity, and then looking at the incremental debottlenecking opportunities.","Past the patent expiration, we're continuing to see strong demand and growth in these products and so while patent expiration might be coming up, we still see margins being maintained, price premium being maintained because of the long successful track record of this product. And so we haven't had any margin deterioration, for example.","Joc O'Rourke","Operator, we still have a couple of questions in the queue. And I would like to see us take both of them, if we can, please.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Piken","Congratulations, Mike, on your retirement. I just wanted to see your comments on Slide 17 with respect to Chinese phosphate demand and the declines that you've seen, is that something that you think is more structural and will continue to go down or they sort of level off from here? And what does that mean over time? Does that mean that China would just end up producing less. I know you talked about the reduction in exports, but just trying to figure out the whole balance of the Chinese market would be great.","And then the second thing is, is there a point in time that is two way for the spring demand to fully recover, in other words the weather forecast has been still pretty dismal here for the next few weeks, like how late can we go in the season before we might start to see some declines in applications? Thanks.","Joc O'Rourke","Mike, I'm going to answer the second one really quickly and hand the first over to Mike. But what I'd say on the first one is, yes, there is always going to be a point where logistics and supply chain may not be able to get enough product into the growing regions fast enough to meet a late spring. And so we could get squeezed a little bit there.","But I'm very careful of crying wolf on that one, because I think every year we say that's a possibility. And every year, we find a way to get that product to market. So Mike, Andy, do you want to talk a little bit about Chinese potash and phosphate demand?","Michael Rahm","Sure. Let me start and I'll let Andy opine as well. Yeah, if you look at Chinese phosphate shipments of the high analysis products that they peaked a few years ago at about 22 million tonnes, I believe. They are down closer to 16 million tonnes.","So we've had a real significant decline in Chinese phosphate shipments and I think the 22 million tonnes was inflated by the fact that there were concerns going back a few years about the security of supply and then whatnot and they did build some strategic reserves in their system and pipeline inventories or channel inventories were very high. They have worked those down.","In fact, we think - we think the channel in China is pretty much completely empty at this point given the deferral that has taken place and we think that 16 million tonne mark that we're forecasting this year is kind of the structural, you know, the correct level and while China is trying to reduce or keep flat their overall nutrient use, we do think there's some substitution of low analysis and the K products and single superphosphates, fused magnesium phosphate that are being produced by these very small plants where there, you know, phosphate mine has been shut down for environmental reasons and so forth.","So we do think that even though phosphate use may stabilize or even go down a little bit, we do think the high analysis products will continue to be shipped at a rate of about 16 million metric tonnes per year. Andy any other comments? Okay. Andy says, no.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","Hopefully a quick one for Clint. Clint, the tax rate guidance for 2019 of low to mid 20s looks OK, but you highlighted volatility and you certainly saw that in the fourth quarter. What would swing you to the low end and what would swing you to the high end of your tax rate range for 2019?","Clint Freeland","Well, John, I think, excuse me - I think the thing to keep an eye on is really the earnings mix in 2019. One of the things that drove the volatility in 2018 was not only the earnings mix between Brazil, Canada, and the U.S., but was also some of the adjustments around our valuation allowances, you know, as we became more profitable, particularly in North America, we were able to use more of the foreign tax credits than we expected and so we had to keep changing some of the valuation allowance levels.","The valuation allowance for the general basket of those foreign tax credits has now been fully reversed. So I wouldn't expect that to create any volatility in '19. So I think going forward, the thing to watch really is the mix of earnings between Brazil, U.S., and Canada.","Joc O'Rourke","With that, I think we've well and truly used up our hour. So I would like to conclude our call by reiterating a couple of key points. This has been a very strong quarter to cap off a year of accelerating momentum for Mosaic. We are demonstrating the earnings leverage that we've created through business transformation across the company and we are well positioned to create meaningful value in 2019 and beyond.","Thank you for joining the call and thank you for your continued interest in Mosaic. Have a great day.","Operator","This concludes The Mosaic Company's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. You may now disconnect."],"15112":["The Mosaic Co.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you. And welcome to our first quarter 2016 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Rich Mack, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","In addition, during the call, we will present both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures are included in the presentation slides and in today's press release.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning. Thank you for joining our call. Today, we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment. The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across the cycle.","I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we have been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time belaboring the business environment. Suffice it to say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business, and know, from prior history, that this cycle, too, will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well-positioned when this happens and to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present.","Grain and oilseed prices have stabilized, with the upward trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today than they were 12 months ago. El Ni\u00f1o-related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in soybean prices and firming corn prices.","These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year, yet fertilizer prices remain low with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $355 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago.","Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including: the strong U.S. dollar, especially against key currencies in potash producing countries; ample channel inventories; declining farm incomes; lower raw material costs; perception of oversupply in potash; and deferred purchasing behavior while the market awaits the bellwether potash contact with China.","Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in Corn Belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialized as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year, as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million, or $0.73 per share, on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14.","In the Potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our Phosphate operating earnings were $18 million, with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we expected and the timing of raw material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.","We continue to expect a strong second half, with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing, and we're seeing good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil, despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly, in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient subsidy resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices are driving strong khareef application.","Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes, as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior. The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current nutrient prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today than they have been during the last five years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.","Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic, today, is a low-cost producer and we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, we announced a plan to obtain $500 million in cost savings. We are on track to achieve that goal, and we are working now to cut costs further.","With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017. We are actively working on our plans in this area and intend to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call.","We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety or critical sustaining capital needs, but we are deferring or eliminating capital spending where we can.","In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years, including the sale of Hersey and the shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtained production when the markets softened.","We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail, along with cost saving and medium-term capital spending, later this year.","At the same time, we are not just battening down the hatches. We are also looking for opportunities to invest, and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic with continue to lead the industry across all cycles.","With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight into our results for the quarter, as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Joc. I'd like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business. We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets. And make no mistake. Better market will materialize at some point.","So, today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment. In Potash, our shipment volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America hampered by weather and cautious purchasing behavior by our customers.","Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally-slow demand, the lack of a China contract, and additional product available in North America. In light of the market dynamics, our Potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary, decisions to stop higher-cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.","Our operating rate in Potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand. With the spring planting season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge when producers reach contracts with Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably India.","As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be in the range of 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, with more of those sales occurring in the second half of the year. In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range-bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.","We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be in the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins. And our expectation for the second quarter is for the Potash gross margin rate to be in the mid-to-high teens, excluding resource taxes. A sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates, and a $50 reduction in average realized K-Mag prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability.","In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes. Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the magnitude of improvements we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.","Lower finished phosphate prices, as well as the timing of raw material pricing, caused our Phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in Phosphates, so I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now. There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes three to four months for raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials.","Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials, leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volumes are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians wait out the impact of the recently-strengthened real, while Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories. As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import sizable volumes later in the year and also anticipate Phosphate gross margins to return to the high teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur prices.","For the second quarter, we expect Phosphate volumes to be in a range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with a sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India and, to some extent, Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics. Our full-year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes, with the decline driven by a slower start to 2016.","In the International Distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher than expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil are continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.","We do not expect a meaningful improvement in International Distribution profitability in the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects a decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our Distribution business later in the year.","Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The three main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we've said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half. In fact, we continue to expect global shipments to be near all-time records. Two, as a result of these strong volumes, we expect to see higher operating rates driving lower costs in both our Potash and Phosphate businesses. And three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapers in value compared to other currencies.","For example, we've already seen the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators suggest that further strengthening of those key currencies is not out of the question. Of course, that also means higher dollar-denominated operating cost for us in Canada, but we believe we are well-hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment, Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers which we have a meaningful degree of control over. This includes: reducing, or altogether eliminating, capital spending; finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs; optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets; driving working capital efficiency; and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements, such as investments and our dividend.","So, let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by deferring, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the Ma'aden project, which is down significant from where we were projecting three months ago. On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years, this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less.","In addition to typical sustaining capital, today, we have three distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above. These projects include Esterhazy K3, the Ma'aden joint venture, and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida.","Our Ma'aden spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed; having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last two projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization.","To reiterate Joc's points regarding expenses, we are moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function costs. We are targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is, in part, driving a reduction in full-year SG&A expenses, now expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year. We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call.","Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exists for us to use when necessary for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment.","So, to summarize, we have built Mosaic, its operations, its talent base and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position, regardless of the market environment. We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt, as necessary, should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected.","Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Rich. At Mosaic, we are focused on what we can control. And we are executing during what we view to be the bottom of the cycle. We are reducing operating and capital spending, optimizing our portfolio, and using our balance sheet strength to ensure our resilience now and into the better price environment that we are sure will come.","We are not losing sight of the long term. We are executing all the good strategic moves we've made since 2013, driving innovation across the company and looking for opportunities to take advantage of our relative strength. The long term remains compelling for agriculture, crop nutrient and for Mosaic. Demand for our products continues to rise with the population and its never-ending demand for food. We intend to meet that demand by managing this company prudently, regardless of the market environment. Many of Mosaic's leadership team have lived through four or more agricultural commodity cycles, spanning back to the mid-1980s. We have the experience to manage through this cyclicality and to recognize the opportunities that it presents.","Now, we will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.","Andrew Wong - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","So, I just wanted to touch on the Phosphate margin guidance. It's a bit better quarter-over-quarter, which is good. I guess that's some of the input cost savings. But I think it's fair to say that it remains quite weak. So, in the presentation and in your prepared comments, you've mentioned that the Phosphate gross margin will go up to 15% to 20% in the second half of this year. Can you just talk about how much of that improvement will be driven by price versus benefit from lower input costs? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Andrew. Yeah. Let me start; Joc O'Rourke here. Let me start by saying, certainly, we do expect some price increases in the second half, as demand really takes off around the globe. And I think to really put the phosphate market into its best perspective, I'm going to let Mike just talk about what he expects for global demand towards the second half, which is really what's going to drive our second half results in Phosphate. Mike?","Mike Rahm - Vice President, Market & Strategic Analysis","All right, thanks, Joc, and good morning, Andrew. Yeah. We have not changed our view on phosphate demand. We actually nudged up our point estimate for global shipments to about 65.6 million tonnes, and we narrowed our range from 65 million to 67 million to 65 million to 66 million.","If you look around the globe at some of the key markets, several positive developments there. In the case of India, I think there's a growing optimism, as far as demand prospects due to a forecast for an above-normal monsoon. You've had some strengthening of the rupee. And we have a very workable subsidy scheme that was introduced at the beginning of their fiscal year.","When you look at a country like Brazil, local currency prices of key commodities like oils, like soybeans, sugar, coffee, are at near all-time highs. We think that underpins very good demand. You look at the fact that there's been an early release of more credit. So, farmers have greater flexibility. The product is moving to the farm, so a lot of positive developments that make us optimistic for second half demand.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, what that means, Andrew, in terms of margin, is, yes, we expect some price improvement. We certainly expect the raw material inputs will benefit from that as they fall through our products. And just as importantly, you've seen our operating costs that we've really have worked hard to reduce and as operating rates go back to more normal rates as this demand picks up, our costs will further decline. So, we expect to see, as we said earlier, pretty normal margin rates in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Joc, I'm wondering if you have a view on whether or not Canpotex should consider shipping into Europe at all, just given there's European assets starting up in Canada and there's been an increase of imports into the U.S. over the past couple of years.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I guess, at this stage, as you're aware, Canpotex \u2013 sorry, Vincent, welcome. At this stage, as you're aware, Canpotex doesn't ship a lot into Europe, although we do ship into Europe. I guess probably today, our disadvantage from a freight perspective probably makes Europe a less attractive market. And if you think about the markets as what goes to one place offsets somewhere else, we're focusing on the areas where we can compete the best.","I'm going to let Rick just give a little more color, if he likes, to that.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah, good morning, Vincent. Canpotex ships into Europe today mostly to industrial accounts that need white potash, and that ends up being a very good market. And I think Joc hit it. When we look at the freight grid, we're much better off going to other markets than we are going into Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jacob Bout with CIBC.","Jacob Bout - CIBC World Markets, Inc.","Good morning. So, I think in your preamble there, you were talking or hinting about further asset rationalization in the Potash division. And just wanted to get your thoughts on how you're thinking about K3. Is there a possibility that you ramp up the CapEx spend there and then have the ability to shut down K1, K2? You guys could lower your operating costs as well.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, good morning, Jacob. Welcome. Thank you for the question. Certainly, when we talk about asset rationalization, we're talking about across our global footprint. We've proven before that we can optimize our costs in some time.","In terms of K3, we continue to drive K3 at an accelerated rate. Although we've reduced capital this year, we have done nothing to impact the critical path of K3. And certainly in early next decade, we'll fully understand where the market is for that, and we'll be making decisions on K3 based on those market conditions at the time.","So, we continue to match our production and sales with global demand, and we'll rationalize our assets to satisfy that demand. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Hello. Two questions on potash, one, I noticed your pricing was boosted by the industrial and feed, and I wonder how long that premium will last. Is that just a lag that will soon go away?","And then, a broader question on Canpotex selling into Asia, you've got contract customers, yet we've seen cases, such as with India last year, where when the contract price is above the market price, they ask for an adjustment. And when you get into a delay in the negotiations over the new contract, it seems to paralyze the whole market. So, would Canpotex be better off moving to a spot basis with its Asian customers?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Don, I'm going to turn a lot of that over to Rick. I just start with your comment or question. Clearly, there are other ways we could be selling globally, including spot markets. And those discussions are, of course, being held in Canpotex, but I wouldn't want to discuss Canpotex's specific market strategies in this call for Mosaic. That would be something, I think, inappropriate for here, but, Rick, can you just talk about our pricing strategy in Canpotex in Asia?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah, good morning, Don. In Asia, the two big markets there, India and China, have been contract markets. And I think Joc did a good job of portraying it. There probably needs to be some changes, but right now, when we're in (28:27) the midst of a discussion about that contract for the remainder of the year, it doesn't do any of us any good to speculate on whether we go contract or spot.","Your second question on industrial and feed accounts -- those contracts have a lagging pricing formula. And those differences will become less as we get through into the second half of the year.","Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you just comment on your expectations for international phosphate prices, specifically in India and Southeast Asia, as recent tenders have been in the kind of 350-ish or even slightly lower range? You alluded to this in your prepared remarks, but, in general, how should we think about your intentions to participate at these levels or lack thereof, particularly if activity's already over-subscribed? And just any color on your expectations for netbacks would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thanks, Chris. In terms of-- generally, I think I'm going to first just highlight that where the market pricing and over-participation, as you say, has been high, Mosaic has taken the position of actually walking away from those markets where we're not getting what we consider to be acceptable returns. Now, having said that, we are price-takers in the end, and we have to meet market. So in terms of our expectation for phosphate pricing in India, I think the issue there is really about the subsidies and what the retail prices are in India and how that fits in. And for that, I'm going to ask Rick and Mike to just touch on that.","Mike Rahm - Vice President, Market & Strategic Analysis","Okay. Yeah, just a couple things in terms of possible second half pricing. One, I think we mentioned before that we think there could be a pretty strong bunching of demand. So we think Brazil will be in the market, India will be in the market, and North America in the fall fill will be all active at pretty much the same time. So, there's the potential for some strong seasonal pressures, we believe. I think the second point is that raw material costs have come down a lot. And then, that's been part of the reason for the drop in phosphate prices, and those costs are beginning to stabilize. So I don't think there's going to be quite as many tailwinds from lower raw material costs.","And then, a third point is some of the currency changes that have taken place is beginning to pinch margins for some of those producers, who've greatly benefited from a depreciated currency. And then, finally, as Joc mentioned, the subsidies that was announced in India is a very workable subsidy. And I think it remains to be seen how the market sort of sorts out the spoils of that subsidy. If there is a bunching and you get some price pressure, certainly, the Indians can afford to pay more. We've done some real simple analysis that shows if retail prices drop slightly in India, certainly the Indians can afford to pay prices up into the 380s. So I think there is the potential there for lots of things combining to provide some uplift in prices second half. Rick?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. I think, Mike, you've nailed it on the impact of India and Southeast Asia pricing. I think the good thing to look at is in the near-term, we've seen an uptick in prices into India and into Pakistan, which is a good first step at a time when Indians have deferred buying. So, when they come with full force, we think that creates a different pricing environment. And if I was an Indian buyer, I'd be stepping in and getting some cover at these levels.","And as we look at what the impact is on netbacks, Joc talked about it earlier, but we see slight improvement in prices. We see the impact of raw materials in the second half hitting us positively, and we see the fact that with the plants running at more normalized operational rate, we see all those three things positively impacting our margins.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein.","Jonas Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys; morning. Two questions, if you don't mind. The first one, I was trying to reconcile the potash prices you had on slide seven, I think, you said $207 realized. And then, you guide to $180 to $200. Am I comparing apples-to-apples when looking at those two numbers?","And the second question is completely different. You took down the CapEx both internally and for Ma'aden. Does that mean we're pushing out the start dates, particularly for Ma'aden, or how should I think about this?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Jonas. Good morning. Good to hear your voice. I'm going to hand both of those over to Rich Mack. I think the first question is really about the math and existing market rates. And then, the second question I think as a board member of Ma'aden, Rich can probably give you the most color.","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Thanks, Joc, and good morning, Jonas. With respect to your first question, yes, it is apples-to-apples. And it really goes to, I think it was Don's question earlier and that is, we benefited in the first quarter from some of the industrial and K-Mag sales that are at higher prices compared to where they will be in the second quarter. Recently, we've seen a precipitous decline, for example, in SOP and that results in some recalibrating for K-Mag prices, just to give one example.","And then on Ma'aden, what you should assume there is this is basically a timing issue with respect to capital. We would effectively guide exactly as we have in the past and that is ammonia production will start in the fourth quarter of this year. I think we are anticipating somewhere in the vicinity of 300,000 tonnes of ammonia that will be produced out of the Ma'aden joint venture in 2016.","Phosphate production will start sometime in the middle part of 2017. Both of those points in time are generally consistent with what we talked about previously. So, think of the deferral in capital in 2016 related to Ma'aden to be something that will be picked up in 2017.","Operator","Next question comes from Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning. Wondering if you could talk a little bit about the strategy in Brazil on potash, my understanding was the distribution arm, your distribution arm, bought tonnes from Eastern European suppliers this past few months to try to ease some of the burden in the country. And also, I know a few months ago when prices were as low $210 a tonne, your distribution arm was going in and trying to buy tonnes and couldn't. Can you talk about now if you're going in and trying to buy tonnes at $215 and $220, if you're finding volume from European competitors on potash? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi. Good morning, Joel. Thanks. I'm going to just hand this straight over to Rick. This question's come up before and I think we need to probably nip it.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good morning, Joel, and thanks for your question. As far as our Distribution business, we did step in and buy tonnes outside of \u2013 Canpotex is our primary supplier, in fact, our sole supplier, but we did step in during a period where they had less tonnes going to the market and bough some from third parties. That continues into the second quarter. It's not a huge amount of tonnes. And frankly, we've been able to manage through kind of a tightness in the marketplace, so that's first.","There was some question of us buying up some tonnes in North America and trying to move them into our own Distribution business taking an arbitrage on the price spreads from the center Gulf to move them into our Brazil business. That, we could not collect up enough to make a vessel truly work, but that arbitrage is there. And if prices remain lower in North America, that would sure lead the opportunity for somebody to play that game.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you. Just looking at Slide 23 on P&K shipments to China and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how influential China is on your Phosphate business, particularly with respect to do you see net capacity growing or shrinking over the next couple of years? Are the Chinese price-setters either all year or perhaps on a seasonal basis? And are the Chinese disciplined when it comes to phosphate production? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben. Most of this I'm just going to hand over to Mike, who really spends a lot of time analyzing this market very carefully. And I think, though, I will say in general our expectations. And I think if you read the major analyst companies, their expectation is Chinese capacity over time will remain flat and will possibly shrink. So, that's basically what's in our plan. But I think to give better detailing, I'm going to hand it straight to Mike.","Mike Rahm - Vice President, Market & Strategic Analysis","Sure. Good morning, Ben. I guess several components to that question. Let's talk about the export numbers first. According to Chinese Customs Statistics, first quarter exports were down about 560,000 tonnes from a year ago. We think that that will continue in the last three quarters of the year. And our last estimate from our Chinese team indicates that we believe that Chinese exports will be down about 2 million tonnes for the year, from the record 11.7 million last year to about 9.6 million tonnes this year.","As you know, the Chinese have stopped building phosphate plants after this dramatic expansion over the past 10 years. And, as Joc mentioned, we think that there will be some restructuring that takes place in what's a very heterogeneous industry there. And that over time, exports probably will stabilize somewhere in that 7 million to 8 million tonne range.","There is an analog, if you looked at what happened on the nitrogen side of the business. I think 2015 was the first year where closures of ammonia capacity exceeded increases in capacity. And so, capacity in China can decline. And we think that over the next five years, you will see a significant restructuring and China becomes certainly a large, but a more stable player in our market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. You talked about the cycle being cyclically weak at this juncture. Notwithstanding that, is it the case that you'd contemplate any meaningful acquisitions? And should you make them, how much are you willing to leverage your balance sheet?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Jeff, good morning. Thank you. So, if I understand, are we contemplating acquisitions and what would we be willing to lever? Let me start this off, and then I'm going to hand it to Rich, but yeah, we look at this part of the cycle, and we're actively looking for opportunities to grow our company over the long term. And we believe this part of the cycle may be opening up opportunities for value that might not exist in other parts of the cycle. That being said, our basic philosophy is any acquisition we make has to meet a return on capital requirement, that meets cost to capital, plus a risk premium, plus a return to shareholders. And then with the share price where it is today, we have the added need of it having to compete with the potential to just buy back our own shares.","In terms of leveraging up, yes, we would be able to lever up. And we have said before we would go beyond our normal 2-to-1 debt-to-EBITDA ratio for the right investment, but realize that we are very conscious of our credit rating, and we're committed to maintaining that. Now, having said that, we expect any acquisition would come with its own earnings, which would offset some of that.","Rich, do you want to add some color to that?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think you've covered it, Joc. I would just say, Jeff, Mosaic will be disciplined through any process that we undertake. And I think we've noted this before. Mosaic was essentially evolved through acquisitions during the down part of the cycle. And so there certainly are opportunities that come in front of us. I've mentioned before almost any phosphate or potash opportunity will come across our desk. And if the circumstances are right, we have the balance sheet capability to do it. And we definitely will stay disciplined, and we are committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And one other point, Jeff. I just want to make, this discipline means we're going to be just as happy to walk away from things if we can't get them at a price that we believe adds real value to our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Joc, you mentioned declining farm income in your opening comments, but how significant a role has that actually played with nutrient prices going down? And as I measure it, nutrients got cheaper and farm income didn't really go down that much in North America this year. So, I'm just curious. You listed it as one of several issues, but how big is it really?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Mark. And actually, it's a great point. Rick and I were with one of our major customers just last week, and they have a relatively detailed analysis of the different costs. And of all the costs, I think potash and phosphate amounted to $61 per acre on a farm in your Indiana-Illinois-type area. Interestingly enough, you're glyphosates and chemicals came to a higher number than that. Nitrogen came to over $100 and seed well over $100.","So, if you look at a farmer and affordability from just that analysis, it really says that if a farmer wants to maximize his revenue from every acre, the last thing you should be doing today is compromising the amount of fertilizer he puts down. Rick, did you want to add anything to that?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","No. And I think that the changes in commodity prices have truly been positive, given where crop nutrient prices are at. I think the issue is is that in a period with everyone, where farmers have lived with prices that are much higher than they are today, there is a percentage of farmers that, at today's prices and nutrient costs and all the inputs, aren't going to make money. And I think that's one thing. That's why we mentioned it is that we're going to go through a period where we just have to understand what real farm income is. And whether it's in Brazil or in North America, we see those things happening. Mike?","Mike Rahm - Vice President, Market & Strategic Analysis","The other thing -- if you just look at North American shipments of potash and phosphate, I mean, they have been remarkably constant for about the last five years or since the financial crisis, and both of them right in that 9 million metric tonnes. So, while there might be front page stories in The Wall Street Journal about the difficulty of Farmer Jones in Decatur, Illinois, the proof is in the pudding as far as the actual shipments, and they've been very, very constant.","Operator","Your next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. This is Dan Jester on for P.J. Just want to clarify one thing. The $500 million cost savings program you announced a few years back -- is that complete? And if not, how much do you have left to get on that?","And secondly, if I recall correctly, you were going to start a new sulfur melter this past quarter. Did that start up? And maybe talk about what the impact on your sulfur cost could be. Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, Dan. Thanks a lot. Let me start with the $500 million. The $500 million program was a five-year program to take out reoccurring costs over that timeframe. We announced that three years ago. And I would say we are certainly on track for it, and probably a little bit ahead of track. We still have some areas where we think we can get some further reductions in both G&A and operating costs, but you can see in our results that a good chunk of that is flowing through our results today, as you're well aware. I mean, our Potash costs are flat, despite a 16% reduction in our operating rates. Our Phosphate conversion costs are lower, despite a significantly lower operating rate. And we've held our phosphate raw costs flat for several years. And all this is part of that program.","You can see our SG&A costs this year down 10%. So, overall, you can see the results as they flow through, but we still have some cost left to come. But it's going very well.","In terms of the sulfur melter, that sulfur melter is now running. Where that will probably have the biggest impact, and you've seen the sulfur prices in the Gulf come down recently. I think what it's done is it's forced the trade flow to go to what makes the best sense. And so what we will see in terms of costs is probably not a significant decrease, but what we will see is the center Gulf liquid sulfur market going down to trading at a discount to solid sulfur again, as it has five, 10 years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Stephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Mike had a few remarks earlier about the outlook for India and Brazil. And I wanted to just drill into U.S. and China a bit here. And with respect to the U.S., given your view of fall applications of P&K and where the spring looks like it's trailing out here, would you say the P&K applications in this fertilizer year that we're in right now will fall short of historical levels or compared to, say, what was removed with last year's harvest? So, that's a U.S. question.","One over on China -- it appears to us that crop yields in that country could be constrained by under-application of potash, in spite of over-application of nitrogen. Would be interested in your view on that and what do you think is the mechanism for those proportions to change over time?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks. Lot of questions, I'm going to hand it straight to Mike to go through this. We want to get through everybody's questions.","Mike Rahm - Vice President, Market & Strategic Analysis","Okay. Yeah. Thanks, Steve, and good morning. And I'll make some comments and I think Rick probably has some comments as well. In the U.S., as far as the spring application season goes, I guess we would characterize it as a strong season. We're seeing good shipments, no indication of changes in application rates. And as we mentioned before, we believe that P&K shipments will continue to be in that 9 million metric tonne range. So that's the situation in the U.S.","And obviously, the spring season is pretty much complete and history. And now, we're beginning to look ahead for fall season. And certainly, when you look at futures prices, you have corn and soybeans still at relatively high levels. Assuming there's a decent crop and a good pull of nutrients, we have no reason to think that the fall application season is going to let up at all. And I guess a positive in North America -- we think the pipeline has been pulled down to much more normal levels or even lower levels after seeing some elevated stocks.","In China, yeah, I think your point is spot on. We expect that. As you know, China has announced zero growth policy after 2020. And they've also announced some changes in their crop support prices. And in terms of no growth, I think you'll see maybe a reallocation of nutrients from nitrogen into phosphate and especially potash.","And I think there's some evidence of that taking place already, because last year, China had record potash imports of over 9 million tonnes, domestic production was up, and their potash shipments are on the rise. And I think that, clearly, is evidence of acknowledging the problem you bring up. Rick, do you have anything?","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","No. I think you've got it covered, Mike.","Operator","Your next question is from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Morning. Can you hear me?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yep.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. If you don't get a Chinese potash agreement this quarter, I assume your full-year outlook would be worse because pent-up demand would continue to be deferred, but do you think that price would still be stable in that scenario? That is, do you think that price may have stabilized in part here because of expectations of a near-term agreement and things could get sloppy again if we don't get that?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to hand that straight to Rick just to answer that as a...","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Good morning, John. Our expectation is for the contract to get completed with the Chinese during the second quarter. So, if it didn't happen, I think that how we operate would be to match up our production to what we believe the market is going to be. And we'll continue to operate that way.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of quick questions, the first one being, in terms of your longer-term strategy, I mean, if the market on potash, in particular, appears to be over-supplied, what is the potential for Canpotex producers to continue to cut production if other producers are running at very high operating rates, particularly those that are higher on the cost curve than you guys?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Look, let me start by saying, and I'm reiterating a point I think we've made a number times, which is we don't see the market as really being all that out of balance. You have a weak market today because of cyclicality. You've also had the impact of seasonality. And the two have combined to create a situation that's pretty difficult for that market. That being said, we believe once the normal flow starts, i.e., once the Chinese contract is in place, once India starts buying and they get a contract in place, the demand gets sopped up pretty darn quickly, and that everybody goes back to more normal operating rates. So, when you ask the long-term, our expectations are Canpotex and Mosaic will continue to match global demand with our available production, as we have in the first quarter. And that we don't see any reason for that to change at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Sandy Klugman with Vertical Research Partners.","Sandy H. Klugman - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. A couple questions, one, how has the challenging backdrop for growers impacted demand for higher margin products, such as MicroEssentials? Second question is any thoughts on how India's pending phosphoric acid settlement will impact the region's desire to import that versus producing the product locally? And then finally, on the longer-term supply demand balance from the phosphate industry, what are your thoughts on how quickly OCP will bring on new granulation capacity?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. There's three there. Thanks, Sandy. There's three there. I'm going to try and get all three. First of all, MicroEssentials, our limit to selling MicroEssentials so far has been our production capacity. We have just completed a $225 million increase in capacity at our New Wales plant, which will give us the capacity to produce 3.5 million tonnes.","As per the earlier question about the economics of buying fertilizer, we believe the economics of using MicroEssentials is better than it's ever been because of the challenging market, not despite the challenging market. So, I would say, first of all, we expect the careful producer will be doing everything they can to increase yield per acre, which includes using the best quality premium products, which would be like our MicroEssentials product or our K-Mag or any of those products that tend to bring on better yield.","In terms of P2O5 to India, I'm going throw that straight over to Rick.","Richard N. McLellan - Senior Vice President-Commercial","Yeah. Good morning. With P2O5, with the acid contract into India, I think there's already been contracts closed into Europe that are at higher levels. I think how the Indian producers think about their phosphoric acid contract is they're producing more NPKs because that allows them to maximize their return from the subsidy. And if you look, in our forecasts, we show less DAP being produced in India, which in turn leads to more imports.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I'll just quickly touch on the OCP. Obviously, we don't have any information that you don't have that's been publicly stated, but OCP has publicly stated that they will contribute, I believe, half the world's growth by their granulation growth. So, I'm assuming that is exactly what they'll do.","We have time for one last question on the thing here. So, let's keep moving.","Operator","You're next question is from Yonah Weisz with HSBC Bank.","Yonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)","Hi there. Thanks for taking the question. A question actually is on your balance sheet, and on some ideas of capital allocation. In the past, you've talked about keeping a $1 billion cash buffer on your balance sheet. There's a chance, I guess, with lower profits and good amount of capital spending, that you may eat into that buffer and go lower than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So, I guess I'm curious to know how low can you go or do you want to go below that $1 billion mark for cash on the balance sheet before something critical happens, like you have to, for example, perhaps cut a dividend or take some serious cuts into your capital spending?","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, Yonah. Let me quickly touch on this, and then I'll hand it to Rich for a second. But the liquidity buffer we carry is $2.5 billion, and exactly what the name implies, it is a buffer for short-term liquidity. Today, we have announced significant cost reductions, further capital reductions, to minimize the impact on that liquidity buffer. But if our cash needs exceed our short-term generation, we will dip into that buffer.","Rich, do you want say anything on that?","Richard L. Mack - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Yonah, I would say that you should just think of what our end goal here is to have about $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, and that can be comprised of either cash on balance sheet or available revolver capacity. And so, at times, that will fluctuate up and down. Today, we still have a very strong cash balance on our balance sheet. And we certainly, we believe with the conservative way in which we have managed our balance sheet in the past, we've got the opportunity to weather any market challenges that might come our way.","James C. O'Rourke - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. With that, I'd like to close off. And let me just make a couple of closing comments. I know there's at least one other company reporting today, so we don't want to cut into their time. Look, we fully expect the markets to strengthen as the year progresses. With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand.","I want to highlight some positive steps, though, that we've taken to reduce our spending, so that Mosaic can weather this current environment and thrive across the cycle. We've held our production costs flat year-over-year in Potash, despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents good cost management, as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our brine inflow cost, while somewhat dependent on Mother Nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to good cost control, good technology application and some currency benefits.","In Phosphates, we've driven our conversion cost lower, despite a significant lower operating rate. And we've held the cash costs of our mining operations flat over several years. We attribute both of those to good cost management. We've reduced our annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million plus deferred almost $100 million in spending for Ma'aden. Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year, as lower incentives are driven by our performance. And our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full-year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates.","So, with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet we need to weather to current market environment. We fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year. And we understand and are prepared for the cyclical nature of this business. The long-term remains very promising, and we manage this company for long-term success.","Thank you for joining the call.

And welcome to The Mosaic Company\u2019s Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today\u2019s call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Mrs. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you. And welcome to our third quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O\u2019Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mossaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management\u2019s beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our third quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday\u2019s Form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Joc.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings discussion. Yesterday after the market closed we released third quarter results which continued to reflect known challenges, with fertilizer prices impacted by high channel inventories in North America and slowing potash shipments into Asia.","With that said, we are beginning to see developments in the market that are constructive on both these points. First, fertilizer is now being applied in North America. We expect a shortened but aggressive application season, which is needed to reduce channel inventories and set the stage for a strong spring season.","Second, India recently settled its potash agreements, which sets a benchmark price and opens the door for product shipments to start moving.","In the U.S. the late harvest and below trend crop yields have pushed corn and soybean prices higher, improving farmer economics for the next year and making fertilizer application more attractive.","In addition, soils are depleted as weather has prevented farmers from applying the appropriate amounts of fertilizer. This is a combination of factors that bodes very well for fertilizer demand heading into 2020.","Clint will provide details on our third quarter earnings, along with an explanation of some abnormal expenses running through the period, including a tax accrual, which by itself impacted adjusted earnings by $0.10 a share. I will focus on our outlook, as well as the actions we are taking to maximize our free cash flow.","One key trend to note as we look forward to prices recovering is it phosphate and potash prices behave very differently, with potash moving more slowly and phosphates correcting sharply. Price increases lag volume movements, especially when we are starting from high inventory positions.","In phosphates, we expect prices to rise as strong demand reduces North American inventories and we have position product strategically to capture time place premiums in key Midwest growing regions. We also expect phosphate demand to remain strong in other regions, including Brazil, where our production assets give us a meaningful advantage.","On the supply side, Chinese phosphate exports are slowing as environmental regulations and economic pressures take effect. At the same time, we have curtailed production and the ramp up of new supply from Saudi Arabia and Morocco is largely complete.","Potash demand was similarly impacted by high North American inventories and a delay in contract settlements, pressuring potash prices. Large potash producers have curtailed production to match supply to demand.","Throughout 2019, Mosaic has continued to focus on strengthening the business, creating additional leverage to market improvement and financial returns. We have managed cash and capital prudently, and have maintained our strong financial position. We have lowered sustaining CapEx for the year and have reaffirmed our commitment to shareholder returns by repurchasing $150 million in Mosaic shares year-to-date.","We have demonstrated our long held commitment to market discipline, curtailing both phosphate and potash production during periods of market weakness. We have retained our ability to resume production quickly as market strengthened.","In Brazil, our Mosaic Fertilizantes business has completed all the actions required to reach its $275 million synergy target in 2019, a year ahead of schedule and we believe we can achieve up to $50 million more in excess of what the target was this year.","We have also kicked off a new program to generate an additional $200 million of EBITDA contribution after 2019, through a mixture of operational improvements, further cost reductions and additional revenue.","Finally, our Esterhazy K3 project is ramping up well. At our Analyst Day this past March, we announced that we were accelerating development of the project by a full year and momentum towards that goal has been better than anticipated.","As a result, we see an opportunity to pull the project forward by an additional year, allowing us to end all brand management spending and realize the full benefits of significantly lower production costs by mid 2022. All this work clearly has strengthened our foundation and position Mosaic for success in a cyclical seasonal business.","Initially harvested yields in North America were coming in line with modest expectations. As more acres are harvested, we are seeing yields come in lower. There are a lot of acres yet to harvest but our expectation is that yields will continue to slip lower and commodity prices will continue to rise.","In the U.S. for 2020, we are forecasting 93 million acres of corn planting and 85 million acres of soybeans. The combination of nutrient depleted soils, more planted acres and excellent affordability of crop nutrients bodes well for fertilizer demand into 2020.","The risk in 2019 continues to be the length of the application window is possible like in 2017. That fall application extends past year end. We believe farmers will make every effort to apply fertilizer in the fall with memories of spring 2019 challenge is so fresh. What farmers can\u2019t apply this fall will be applied in the spring.","Our outlook remains bullish, as we expect strong demand to pull down access inventories and prices to improve as we move into 2020.","Now, I will ask Clint to provide more insight into our third quarter results and our outlook for fourth quarter and next year.","Clint Freeland","Thank you, Joc. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $366 million and adjusted earnings per share were $0.08. The company generated close to $500 million in cash from operations, with half of that cash being reinvested in our business and the majority of the balance being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cash balances end the quarter at $641 million.","On a segment basis, solid performance in potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes was offset by continued weakness in phosphates primarily due to downward pressure on market prices. The potash business unit performed well.","Volumes were at the midpoint of the range and adjusted gross margin per tonne came in strong as both prices and costs were better than expected. While we were pleased with third quarter results in potash, we do see challenges in the fourth quarter specifically around volumes as we await completion of the China contract.","In phosphates, while volumes were on the low end of our range adjusted gross margin per tonne remained at negative $6. As a $13 per tonne benefit from lower raw material costs was offset by declines in average sales prices.","Mosaic Fertilizantes continued its strong performance with adjusted gross margin per ton of $39 reflecting strong distribution margins and favorable product mix. Global phosphate price pressures did not impact Mosaic Fertilizantes as much as our phosphate segment. As the Brazilian product mix is more diversified and its distribution business generates more consistent margins.","Sales volume during the quarter were initially delayed due to dry weather, but are now progressing well and we expect to finish the year strong. We continue to expect Brazil to set another record for total fertilizer shipments this year.","And finally, there were a few items worth noting that impacted results beyond segment performance starting with our effective tax rates. As we have discussed in the past, earnings mix plays a large role in our tax rates and as phosphate results have continued to weaken, our expected tax rate for the year has risen, as a higher proportion of earnings are expected to come from Canada and Brazil, both of which are higher tax jurisdictions in the U.S. As a result, we now expect our effective tax rate for the ear to be in the mid-30% range compared to the mid-to-high 20% range we discussed last quarter.","Given this, we booked a catch up accrual during the third quarter, as well as a required interim period accrual that will reverse when we close the books at year end. These two third quarter accruals totaled $39 million impacting third quarter EPS by $0.010 per share.","In addition, we recorded $62 million of other operating expense, $48 million after notables, which is approximately twice what we would expect in the normal quarter. $23 million of the total adjusted expense is due to increases in legal reserves in Brazil and non-recurring re-class of prior operating costs.","The higher than normal legal reserves negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.02 per share at our estimated full year effective tax rate. These were not treated as notables to be consistent with past practice. Excluding these tax and other expense items, Mosaic\u2019s adjusted EPS for the quarter would have been $0.20.","The Mosaic Fertilizantes segment has realized $230 million of net synergies in its P&L through the third quarter of this year and we expect to finish the year strong. As many of the synergies flow through our cost of goods sold, ultimate realization depends on sales volumes.","Based on current sales forecast for the fourth quarter, we expect to exceed our $275 million target for this year by up to $50 million, demonstrating the continued acceleration of synergy recognition on a per tonne basis quarter-over-quarter.","Earlier this year, we announced the next phase of business improvement in Brazil, with a target of achieving an additional $200 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2022. This program is not simply an extension of our synergy program, but new initiatives that will build on our accomplished to-date","In addition to strong execution in Brazil, the company is executing very well on the K3 development in Canada, which we believe is one of the best performing potash projects in the world.","We announced a one year acceleration of the project at our Analyst Day earlier this year and now believe we can accelerate the project by an additional 12 months to 18 months, as minor assembly times have been reduced to three months compared to four months under the first acceleration, and six months in the original plan.","While this acceleration will pull CapEx forward, we expect to remain below budget for the total project. Faster project execution will allow us to increase total brine management cost savings to $225 million and accelerate $75 million in operating cost reductions by more quickly migrating production from K1 and K2 to K3.","This $300 million of cost savings is significant. It\u2019s roughly equivalent to 10% of gross capital spending on the K3 project and a third of net capital spending, and helps generate an unlimited after tax IRR in excess of 25% on all accelerated capital spend.","As we look to the balance of the year, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect results through the third quarter, as well as sales expectations and more recent pricing levels for both potash and phosphates. Based on these factors, we now see adjusted EBITDA at $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and adjusted EPS at $0.50 to $0.60.","Some of the key assumptions in our forecast include the following. First, over 50% of our phosphates and potash sales are priced, reducing our exposure to changes in market prices.","Second, we expect potash sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes and gross margin per tonne of $60 to $70.","Our previously announced 600,000 tonne curtailment was in response to changing near-term demand expectations and is now reflected in the sales volumes we expect for the quarter. This assumes no China and minimal India tonnes and market prices as of October 24th.","For the phosphate business unit, we expect sales volumes of 2 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes and adjusted gross margin per tonne from negative 10 to zero, which assumes market prices as of October 24th, approximately $15 lower than third quarter averages.","Mosaic Fertilizantes is expected to sell a total of 2.2 million tonnes to 2.4 million tonnes of finished product, most of which is already committed. Gross margin per tonne is expected to be in the range of $40 to $50 as we recognize the last of the higher costs related to the tailings dam [ph] regulatory changes.","Lastly, we expect corporate and other to deliver $10 million to $20 million of gross margin and our equity loss from the modern joint venture to be approximately $20 million.","As is our custom, we intend to initiate 2020 financial guidance on our yearend earnings call in February. As we prepare for that, we are mindful of the fact that over the past couple of years, we have adjusted guidance multiple times each year, primarily due to either strengthening or weakening market prices.","With that in mind, we are evaluating alternative approaches that focus more on cost, operating targets and sensitivities, so that investors can more easily forecast results as market prices change. You will hear more about this on our yearend earnings call.","But as you start to think about 2020 and what should be different compared to 2019, I would call your attention to four things which are expected to total $225 million in incremental earnings compared to 2019 before any changes in market prices.","First, Mosaic will incur approximately $80 million in costs this year to manage the Fertilizantes business during dam remediation efforts. We would obviously not expect that to reoccur next year.","Second $20 million in idle cost for Plant City in the first half of the year will not reoccur is that facility has now been closed and asset retirement work has begun.","Third our Esterhazy K3 facility is expected to produce 1 million tonnes of potash in 2020 600,000 tonnes higher than in 2019, leading to an additional $70 million to $80 million in adjusted EBITDA.","And finally, realizing a full year of run rate synergies in Brazil, together with new initiatives being executed, is expected to improve results by at least $50 million. So in total, we see a clear path to an additional $225 million in adjusted EBITDA next year before any changes in market prices.","With that, I will turn the call back over to Joc.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thank you, Clint. Clearly, 2019 has been a challenging year for fertilizer markets, which once again demonstrates that Mosaic is in a business that is both cyclical and subject to weather related and other short-term disruptions.","To succeed in this business for the long term we know that we need to be efficient, we need to adjust quickly and we need to preserve our ability to benefit from periods of strong demand and prices.","We are aggressively managing costs across the enterprise, we are managing capital effectively, we are maintaining our market discipline and we have taken necessary actions this year to adapt to the temporary challenges in the market environment.","Volume leads price and volume has started moving. Product is moving to the ground in North America. In fact, it\u2019s moving to the ground globally. We expect supply and demand will move into better balances as we move into 2020 and we expect strong fertilizer markets next year and beyond given appealing market fundamentals,","Mosaic is poised to take advantage of these improving opportunities. Before I open it up for questions, I would like to note that Rick Mclellan, who has led Mosaic Fertilizantes since we began integration efforts. We will return to the U.S. to lead the commercial organization.","Leadership of Mosaic Fertilizantes has been transferred to the very capable hands of Corrine Ricard. I would like to thank Rick for the remarkable work that he has led to remake the Brazil business and reach our synergy targets. Corrine has more to do and I have every confidence that she and our Brazilian team will have similar success.","Now, we will take your questions. Operator","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Lucas Beaumont","Good morning guys. This is Lucas Beaumont for Chris. Could you please walk us through your stripped margin outlook for \u201820 and \u201821 all of the moving parts and what\u2019s the best way to think about your margin outlook heading into next year, especially given the lower sulfur pricing.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Sorry. Good morning, Lucas, early mic problem. Welcome. I am going to hand this over to Corrine to give you some information on that, but our expectations is as the price -- as the market starts moving, that indeed prices will follow the volume. And as we move into the year, we are going to see the lag on our sulfur and ammonia plant prices catch up. And so we expect an inflection in our pricing, which really will move over better margins for next year. Let me give this to Corrine to answer.","Corrine Ricard","All right. Thanks Joc. I think it\u2019s important to note what we have a decrease in margins today, these are largely unpublished prices based on extremely low volumes. Literally one barge is effecting price trade. So don\u2019t really reflect the market.","That being said, I think, it\u2019s probably most productive for us to talk about what are the things that indicate an inflection in pricing that will cause a movement in the other direction and get prices moving again.","Historically, those inflection points have come when you see market prices that reach the marginal costs for producers or cash costs that\u2019s currently happening today. And you see idling as a result. We have certainly seen closures such as Mosaic plant city. But also you know, nutrient, the [inaudible] and others are taking a curtailments.","You see a second cause of a major inflection is a demand resurgence and given the weather results from last year and what we believe will be a high corn crop this next year, we expect to see strong demand. We are seeing that in other markets as well now India, China. China has stabilized than Brazil.","And then third, you will often see a market consolidation or a discipline in the industry, and we are seeing that with some curtailed production, as well as some consolidations that are happening in rationalization in China.","So, overall, the three things that primarily drive these inflection points are happening today. And so we really do believe the bottom is in and we should see resurgence to the normal seasonal pattern of upstream in margins as we get into the spring season and see volume moving.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone. So, question on the phosphate market and maybe it\u2019s keying off of something, Corrine, you just said in your response there about market structure and you have seen this big import flow into NOLA and you are seeing these indexing of OSP and Saudi tonnage to barge prices, which can be influenced by traders. And just from a market structure perspective, I mean, just can you talk about what Mosaic can do to combat this? And then on the marginal cost, I mean, Corrine, I just want to be clear. I mean, are you actually seeing capacity closures in China? Just from a marginal cost perspective, it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s actual supply rationalization happening amongst the major exploiters. Just a little bit more color that would be helpful. Thank you.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","I pass this to Corrine, but I will make a couple of comments. First of all, let me say, what\u2019s going on in the NOLA market is quite disconnected from either what\u2019s going on upcountry or what we are selling for. So it is a market manipulation play and I guess it takes two to tango, but the importers are allowing itself. That is that piece.","But in terms of the upcountry market, it really isn\u2019t what we are playing with it. A very low volume market that\u2019s being a single barge or a couple of barges being traded to set an index price. Once real volume starts moving, that goes away very quickly as it has in the past. Corrine, do you want to talk a little more on that.","Corrine Ricard","Sure. We have seen a lot of imports come in. There\u2019s no doubt about that and the index pricing, that Joc and all of the publications I have talked a lot about are a clear indication that there are a lot of games being played on pricing.","I think it\u2019s important to note, the only one who\u2019s selling a lot of tons at these kinds of prices are our international competitors. Our domestic customers at this point have their inventories full. They have got a regular supply of product and our sales largely are happening out of places like our Pine Bend warehouse, rail delivered into other markets. And so while these index prices do have an impact on sentiment overall and general market trend, they don\u2019t really reflect what we are selling at, but more what others are selling at.","In terms of your China question, I would say that we are seeing closures in China. But we have talked before about the depressed economic environment that they are facing, as well as the environmental and regulatory decisions that are having an impact on those Chinese producers.","We see rock production year-to-date is down 9.2% in China. Their costs are up on gypsum disposal. Their ammonia costs are up because of environmental air quality requirements. And with the currency corrections that you are seeing, their cost thresholds on average today are about $310 to $315 on an FOB basis for exports. So, we are trading today below those costs levels. And I think that, it\u2019s absolutely going have an impact.","We are seeing producers facing decisions about whether or not they will close and relocate those plants more than a couple of kilometers off the river in these economics, those are tough choices to make.","We just saw an announcement by SinaChem about the closure of the fooling plant, which is about a million and a half tons of capacity. And while they may decide to relocate or reconfigure that plant, you know, those plans are more than three years away and right now what\u2019s happening is a closure of that plant. So, yes, we are believing -- we do believe that economic factors, as well as these environmental pressures are pushing for rationalization in the phosphate industry in China.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas Oxgaard","Hi. Good morning.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Good morning, Jonas.","Jonas Oxgaard","Can you talk a little bit more about the expectation of volumes next year and how much pent up demand do we actually have in the soil at this point? What can we expect out of North America and China particularly?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Well, I think, in simple terms for North America, we are looking at a corn planting of 93 million acres next year. We are looking at soybean planting of 85 million acres, which should bode well to taking North American demand up to at least where it was in previous years and then beyond that to make up what might have been missed. And I think in both nutrients there\u2019s been up to a million tons of missed a product going on the ground. So I think in both those cases, we should see very good demand in North America.","In terms of China, we are seeing good internal demands starting and we see that sort of balancing off at 15 million tonnes of demand of phosphates internally in the domestic market. And the other one we expect is we expect good potash imports next year into China.","So overall, we are expecting a big jump or a good jump in overall potash around the world up to, let\u2019s say, an average of 67 million tonnes and probably around 69 million tonnes for phosphates around the world. So both of those are a big jump up and really should drive the inventory out of the system as it exists today. I am going to hand it over to Corrine for a few extra detailed comments.","Corrine Ricard","Sure. Thanks, Joc. Yeah. I would say that we have a real step up we expect in global shipments. Demand is solid in most all regions. We have seen a good recovery in Malaysia Indonesia with palm prices and expect to see good potash demand there.","Our single point estimate you can even see in the presentations on potash, our single point estimate is more like 68 million tonnes for global shipments. But that could be as high as 69 million tonnes. And then that is up about 3 million tonnes on potash shipments for the year.","And then on phosphates we have a single point estimate of about 70 million tonnes could be as high as 71 million tonnes up a couple million tonnes on phosphates as well. So good demand expectations from us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Your phosphate margins I have obviously been negative for the last few quarters. How long are you willing to let the business run kind of at that level before you want to take different actions here? It doesn\u2019t seem like a lot of your offshore competitors are taking the same kind of downtime and pain that you have been willing to do to try to balance inventory? Thanks.","Clint Freeland","Good morning, Joel, and thank you. Look, the way we are looking at this today is we have capacity for what we believe is the demand coming up in the next year. And so, we expect that capacity to be fairly well utilized.","So, we believe our Louisiana operations are basically essential to meet that new demand in 2020. And also worth noting that while our Louisiana operations, our highest cost is location on the Mississippi River is integrated ammonia operations and access to low cost high quality sulfur from the Gulf really make it pretty competitive on a delivered cost basis and make an integral part of our potash -- our phosphate portfolio.","So, the other thing is, Louisiana makes a lot of our micro essential. So as we look at this going forward, we think this is a temporary seasonal thing. And we expect we are going to need that production in the near-term.","In terms of how our competitors are responding I am not going to comment on their actions. I will say Mosaic though takes the approach that we always follow value rather than volume and we are matching what we think is our customers demand. And we don\u2019t intend to go below that, but we do intend to make sure that we don\u2019t oversupply a market that doesn\u2019t need it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Joc, early in the K3 project said that under certain conditions, it would continue to operate the old mine at reduced rates. Are you going to be keeping any of K1 and K2 on a maintenance schedule for potential use or is that going to be shut for good?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yeah. Thanks for that, Mark. Let me start off by saying the K3 project has been a real execution win for Mosaic. Our Canadian team has just found, incredible new ways to modularize the assembly of underground miners and other equipment and this is really what\u2019s allowed us to accelerate this project. As such, what we are looking at today is a very successful project that will reach its total capacity a couple of years ahead of our original schedule.","As such, we don\u2019t see a need for the K1 and K2 mines after 2022 and the reason for that is we have capacity for milling, but we will be constrained by that milling capacity with the capacity of K3. So, it really the acceleration has changed the need for any increase or lengthening of the K1 and K2 mines.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts","Thank you. On Slide 20 where you gave selected items to 2020. Do you have any early thoughts on modern for 2020?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Yeah. Yeah. So, thanks John. Yeah. Modern is a little more difficult to predict for 2020 the capacity will go up in 2020 driving their overall costs down. But really it depends on the phosphate market on how much the contribution is going to be on modern. We really don\u2019t expect a lot of equity earnings in 2020, if any, and that\u2019s because if you look at the sort of run rate this year, their loss will be probably in the $200 million range. So if even if you take that to a new capacity, they have got to improve their efficiencies before we are going to see any real equity earnings.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong","Hey. Good morning. So I am just going back to the phosphates. I am trying to understand how the phosphate cost curve looks today versus pricing and maybe just focusing on DAP. We have heard about phosphate rock price cuts in China. Obviously, sulfur and ammonia prices are lower and all those are pass-throughs, but that affects that pricing. Maybe -- if you could just help quantify where you see the marginal cost curve today because it obviously moves a lot?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Let me go back to Corrine. I mean, I think, Corrine said that the average cash cost in China today is about $315 a tonne and that\u2019s taking into account the RMB moves, the ammonia moves sulfur and rock costs.","What that means though, is that\u2019s an average that means 50% of all Chinese production is basically underwater at these prices. I just mentioned modern and while modern will be cash positive, with their high level of debt repayments that project is not making money, which would mean their overall breakeven is more in the range of $350 plus.","So if you look at it where is the marginal cost producer, I am saying the marginal cost producer is probably certainly above that $315 and $320 range and likely well up into the $400 range for a non-integrated Indian producer maybe the Mexican producers and some of the Chinese producers.","Operator","Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","PJ Juvekar","Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Joc, Miski Mayo is one of your high cost mines to some extent, as phosphate sales have of slowdown. Is that a mine that you could potentially slowdown. I know you have some contractual terms there, but what can you do there and was the opportunity to lower costs?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","PJ, let me say, Miski Mayo is probably disadvantaged on a delivered basis because of the transport obviously to Louisiana. But again, it tends to give us a good opportunity to keep Louisiana going preserve rock in Florida and if you work that out overall, it\u2019s a pretty good asset for us.","Now, what I will say there, though is, they are making, since we have taken over that joint venture, we have made great progress on reducing costs and I intend on the in the future to set some real targets there for reduce costs. So we would like to make Miski Mayo a real integral part of our overall production plans. And to do that, though, I -- we agree we need to really work hard on reducing the cost of that operation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotia Bank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson","Good morning. Thank you. I am trying to understand the difference between expected shipments and underlying demand. And I was hoping maybe Andy you can talk a little bit about in key markets where phosphate inventories or stocks are versus kind of where comfortable levels should be or have been historically?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","I will let Corrine answer a bit of that. But I would say look, we know that North American inventories are high. We believe that in country inventories for both potash and phosphate are reasonable in India. We believe both in country inventories for phosphate and potash are below normal in China right now.","So while the port inventories for potash are high in China. We believe in country inventories are actually quite low, which means that you will see the port inventories move into countries quite quickly. So, overall, across the globe, and I am sorry, in Brazil, we are seeing phosphate inventories are down a couple of percent by the year end and potash inventories up a little bit.","So, overall, we don\u2019t think the inventories are that out of whack. And what we will say here is, as well is, with low prices, people tend to deplete their inventories. And during rising prices, they tend to build up their inventories. So we believe the inventories are being depleted. So what\u2019s going on the ground is probably exceeding what is actually being delivered in these markets right now. Corrine, do you have anything to add to that?","Corrine Ricard","Not too much to add, Joc. I think it\u2019s a good point that there\u2019s a natural tendency to destock when prices are falling. Nobody wants to try to figure out what that bottom price level is. And so we are seeing some destocking in some markets.","Some got caught quite long with the weather changes and they are working off those inventories. And we have seen some channel stuffing by some of the -- our international competitors, putting it into traders and markets trying to position.","But in country, places like China, the in-country potash inventory levels out at the NPK plants et cetera, we believe are pretty low. And so there is some real movement for tonnage to go when we see that demand volume kick back in.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","And just let me reiterate there as well. We have people on the ground with our distribution businesses. And, clearly, in North America, Brazil, India and China, which are our major markets. So we have a pretty good handle on what\u2019s moving in country compared to maybe some of our competitors.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. So -- this is Matthew [ph] on for Steve by the way. But you talked a little bit about inventories. Clearly, North America, they are bloated. But if we are looking into 2020, really forecasting a pretty modest increase for shipments into country despite what\u2019s been a pretty poor year for applications. So, again, is this just elevated channel inventories or why don\u2019t you foresee a better rebound in North America applications next year?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","I think we do expect a big -- sorry, Matthew, welcome. We do expect a big rebound in North American application. But I think you hit it on the head there. There\u2019s a lot of channel inventory right now. Many of our customers are full. And it\u2019s not unusual to be full going into spring. But we are full for a couple of seasons now. So that is unusual. So we expect that that inventory has to move out of the system first and then the actual shipments from those producers can start.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken","Yeah. Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how we should be forecasting your ammonia costs for the coming quarters, given that Faustina [ph] is currently shut down and how we should be thinking about that going into 2020 as well?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thanks, Michael. I will touch this and maybe Corrine might touch it a little bit as well. But here\u2019s how our normal ammonia supply works. We buy about a third on the open market, we receive about a third with our CF contract and we make about a third with our own production.","Now, clearly, our -- in terms of cost right now, the lowest cost is our own production. And then our market cost is second, and CF is in today\u2019s market significantly higher than that. I think the CF market is in the $350 range today, with natural gas prices where they are.","So what you will see with the ammonia plant down is that we will have a higher waiting of the market price, which is in the mid-200s and a higher waiting of the CF price, which is in the 350 range, and a lower waiting of our own production. So that will increase our cost above market at this stage.","In 2020 -- at the start of 2020, we will have unloading or loading facilities at our dock in Louisiana, which will allow us to take the ammonia from Faustina and move it to our Florida operations, which will really give us a big cost advantage and allow us to utilize that ammonia much more effectively.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Andrews","I think what I heard earlier was your plan on starting the phosphate assets pretty much for the beginning of the year, given the demand that you are forecasting. When do you think you will bring the potash assets back online? Is there any risk to remain offline in the first quarter?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thanks. Thanks, Vincent. Yes. Our intentions are, at this stage, that Louisiana would probably come up year-end or early in the New Year, depending on how the fall season is going and what we see is a need there.","In terms of the Colonsay and the potash, the tradeoff there will be, both will be twofold. One will be how is the potash market developing? Do we have a Chinese contract? Has that shipment started? Have the -- we have seen good increases in pricing for palm oil, do we see higher shipments into Malaysia and Indonesia from Canpotex?","So if those Canpotex shipments start, that will lead us to favor bringing Colonsay up. At the same time, our K3, as we keep saying, is coming up faster than we expected. So if we can meet the need with the lower cost K3 product that will probably be where we would focus.","Operator","And the last question comes from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson","Yes. Thank you. Just a couple of questions on potash. One, can you talk a bit about potash pricing in the domestic market? I know you raise prices post the completion of summer. Are you actually seeing any of those higher prices being realized currently? And Joc, if you could just clarify what\u2019s the future of Colonsay once K3 is up and running, given its cost structure relative to K3 and even K1 and K2?","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Thanks, Don. Let me take the second question, first. Look, Colonsay is a good asset in the potash markets that we had, maybe even five years ago Colonsay was a very good profitable operation. Today, with the new structure and K3 coming up, Colonsay is going to definitely be our swing plant.","And as such, we wanted there to be available when we need it. But at the same time, if we can supply from Esterhazy and Del Plain [ph], we feel that\u2019s a more economic way to supply the market needs.","So it really is going to depend on how fast the market grows. I mean, current projections from CRU and stuff says that probably Colonsay will be running intermittently in the next little while rather than steadily. But more to come on that and final decisions will be made probably in the early next year. In terms of potash pricing, in the market, I think, maybe Corrine best answer that.","Corrine Ricard","Sure. We did get good participation in our summer fill program and got a lot of products sold for that time period. We even posted prices higher as we normally do after a fill program. I would say, it has been difficult to get those prices to stick.","We have seen a lot of pressure from our domestic competitors who seemed to have accepted much lower prices. And we have continued to make sales. Today, Corn Belt warehouse price is in that $270, $280-ish kind of range.","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay. Well, with that, I\u2019d like to conclude our call. I know you have a lot of other calls today and I\u2019d like to reiterate our key points. While 2019 has been a challenging year for North American agriculture, Mosaic has maintained its focus on the things we can really control.","We have made tremendous progress. We have accelerated K3 mine again, which will lead to significant savings and a highly efficient potash operation. We have idled productions to help balance supply and demand. The transformations of our potash and phosphate businesses, as well as our corporate functions are ongoing, and they are delivering real bottomline results. And we are driving remarkable improvements in our Mosaic Fertilizantes business in Brazil.","All these efforts have Mosaic positioned well to benefit from improving market conditions. We expect agricultural fundamentals to strengthen further, and we expect strong global demand and rising prices for both phosphates and potash, as we move into 2022. We are highly optimistic that business conditions will improve and the Mosaic will be there to deliver strong returns as that happens. Thank you for joining us this morning, and have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company.","Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura C. Gagnon - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you and welcome to our second quarter 2018 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our first quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. I would like to start by welcoming Clint Freeland, Mosaic's new CFO, to the call. Clint has been with us a couple of months now and he is fully immersed in the business. Our results for the quarter reflect continuing improvements in business conditions as well as meaningful benefits of our many strategic moves, including the acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes and the transformation of our cost base across the company.","We would like you to take away three key messages from this call. First, Mosaic is generating strong cash flow, demonstrating both the resilience of our business and the earnings leverage we created. Second, we expect to deliver strong results for the remainder of 2018. And third, phosphates and potash markets continue to strengthen, and we believe they will remain firm.","For the quarter, net earnings were $68 million, or $0.18 per share. After adjusting for notable items, primarily non-cash items related to foreign currency changes, Mosaic earned $0.40 per share on sales of $2.2 billion, up both sequentially and year-over-year. We have also raised both the full-year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance.","I'll begin with brief observations on the market, starting with phosphates. If we look back a year or two, 2018 was expected to be a tough year for phosphates with several new production facilities coming online around the world and demand struggling to absorb the new production. What we're seeing today is a relatively tight phosphate market with strong demand offsetting the gradual ramp-up of new supply. It is worth noting that new greenfield projects take a long time to reach full production capacity. That includes our joint venture with Ma'aden in Saudi Arabia as it gradually works towards its stated capacity of 3 million tonnes annually. In addition, Mosaic's idling of Plant City and ongoing restructuring of the Chinese industry have further tightened the S&D with phosphate industry stripping margins now at their highest point in four years. That obviously is great for Mosaic, especially considering the 4.5 million tonnes of phosphate production capacity included in our recent acquisition in Brazil.","Mosaic's global network of analysts expects global phosphate demand to reach another new record next year, with 70 million to 72 million tonnes of shipments predicted. New supply will continue to gradually come into the market at a pace we expect will be challenged to keep up with growing demand. As a result, we expect the phosphate market momentum to continue into 2019.","In potash, the global supply and demand picture remains balanced and the prices are holding up well. Potash demand and producer shipments through the first half of 2018 continued a strong pace following last year's record-setting numbers.","Despite the recent drop in agricultural commodity prices, nutrients remain affordable and farmers are replenishing depleted soils after several back to back large crops. As we look ahead, we believe demand growth will be in balance with the new product that is coming to market over the next several years.","We are keeping our eye on a couple of factors. First, Chinese phosphate experts have fallen year-to-date, in part because of new environmental restrictions on industrial facilities in China. But as market prices and stripping margins rise and the Chinese currency weakens, producers there may respond by resuming higher export levels. Longer term, we continue to expect high cost Chinese producers to balance the market, which is a positive for Mosaic as a vertically-integrated producer.","Second, agricultural commodity prices are in flux. While we will continue to closely monitor these developments and assess their potential impact on global P&K shipments, at this point, however, demand prospects look strong in our two key geographies. Soybean economics are highly profitable in Brazil due to weaker reais and a record local basis.","In North America, farmers are expected to harvest another large crop about a month earlier than normal, and that means they will have ample time to replenish the record amounts of P&K taken out of the field this fall.","Now, I'll move on and provide some insight into our business segments. First, in the phosphates business unit, we generated gross margin of $67 per tonne, or $70 per tonne after notable items, more than double the same quarter a year ago. Margins obviously benefited from higher market prices for our product. Just as important, though, is the progress we are making towards transforming this business unit.","As an example, even with a significantly higher percentage of Miski Mayo rock consumed during the quarter, our phosphate rock costs remain below $60 per tonne. In addition, we had record quarterly sales of our MicroEssentials premium products. During the quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by costs associated with a once-every-five-year turnaround of our molten sulfur barge, as well as higher sulfur costs from using more prilled sulfur. These higher sulfur costs are expected to carry into the third quarter.","In the potash business unit, our gross margins improved sequentially with higher sales volumes offsetting the cost impact of weather-related logistics issues at the beginning of the year. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we experienced containment issues during the first quarter, and that impact flowed through the P&L during the second quarter. Production cost during the second quarter remained very well controlled, and prices inched higher which bodes well for our profitability for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we will undergo several typical maintenance turnarounds during the third quarter which is embedded in our assumptions and our guidance.","We continue to make good progress at K3. We recently commissioned the overland conveyor and it will soon be tied into the K2 mill. All facilities are now in place to enter the production phase later this year. We plan to provide a more in-depth update on K3 at our next earnings call. Longer term, we expect to continue to drive unit cost down as we ramp up our Esterhazy K3 mine and eventually eliminate brine management costs at K2.","Mosaic Fertilizantes, our business in Brazil and Paraguay is also performing well. The previously published pro-formas showed the business was about breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis during the second quarter of last year. This year we generated $55 million of adjusted EBTIDA. Some of the improvement came from favorable currency exchange rates and higher phosphate prices. But much of the improvement resulted from the work we are doing to transform the business.","Our results in Brazil for the second quarter were negatively impacted by almost $40 million for both planned turnarounds and the nationwide truckers' strike in May. As a result of the strike, we idled production and lost shipment volumes, which caused us to miss our volume guidance for the quarter. In total, we estimate the strike lowered adjusted earnings by approximately $11 million before tax.","We are continuing to monitor the situation closely as the government and the truckers work to find a more lasting resolution. Regardless, we believe our position at the low end of the delivered cost curve gives us a competitive advantage in Brazil. The teams in Brazil are well ahead of schedule to achieve $100 million in net savings this year and $275 million by the end of 2020. They are executing several hundred projects from labor efficiencies to mine process improvements and increased chemical plant throughput.","Year-to-date, $56 million of gross synergies, or $34 million after cost to achieve have hit the bottom line. As an example, we are pleased to see that costs at our Tapira mine have already been reduced by almost 30% on a reais basis. While we believe it is likely we will achieve net synergies in excess of $100 million in 2018, there is still much to be done.","One of the key risks we continue to watch is the implementation of the government's published minimum freight rates. The entire Brazil team is energized and employee morale is very high as Clint and I saw firsthand during a recent visit.","It is worth reminding you that Brazil remains an extremely attractive agricultural market. Brazil is expected to surpass the United States in total soybean production for the first time this year and the market needs fit well with Mosaic's product mix. Brazil's primary crop of soybeans needs high levels of phosphate and potash.","A final point on Brazil. The weak Brazilian reais was a modest net benefit to us during the quarter. The benefit of currency devaluation are delayed as the changes impact the cost of production which are recognized when the product is sold. In addition, a proportion of these costs are hedged. In addition, we are close to fully hedged on the reais-based cash and net receivables on our Brazilian balance sheet.","Now, a note on capital. Our strong business performance in Brazilian customer prepayments are driving good cash flow. For the quarter, we generated close to $600 million in free cash flow. We are using some of our cash to pay down debt and work towards returning to our through cycle leverage ratio targets. In fact, with an additional $200 million of debt retired already in the third quarter, we have already achieved our target of paying down $500 million by the end of 2018.","Our capital priorities have not changed. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and sustain our assets, and then we assess the best use of remaining capital given the opportunities we see, including investments and shareholder returns. In total, we are pleased with Mosaic's performance for the quarter. We are optimistic that we will deliver strong results for the remainder of 2018. Markets are strengthening and our execution is generating real financial benefits. That's why we now expect to be in the $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion range for adjusted EBITDA and in the $1.45 to $1.80 per share range for adjusted EPS this year. We have built a resilient business, and our many strategic moves position Mosaic to generate attractive returns as this market continues to improve.","Now, we will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joc, you mentioned the higher stripping margins potentially helping sort of keep some of Chinese capacity in the export market. How do you think about that vis-\u00e0-vis your capability to bring back Plant City which would, in theory, probably temper China's exports? So, obviously curtailing Plant City has had great impact on the market \u2013 very positive impact on the market, but how do you counterbalance that with maybe the Chinese capacity not going away as fast as we thought?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Good morning. And, Vincent, good to hear from you.","Well, let me start by just giving you a little bit of our thoughts on Plant City, and I'm going to hand it to Corrine to just talk a little bit about some of these changes in China. And we do believe that with these higher prices, the changes will occur a little slower. We'll see higher utilization of some of the better environmental-performing plants and the less expensive plants. But overall, I think we believe the trend is definitely that China will slowly decrease their exports.","In terms of Plant City, the criteria for Plant City review has really not changed from last year. As you say, the thinking behind idling Plant City in the first place came from expecting to offset some of the new production that was coming on. Clearly that new production has come on a little slower than we would have expected or might have been predicted, but at the same time, we still fully expect that production will come on in the next couple of years. Some of that will be offset by growth in the market, but we also believe some of that is offset by our own reduction in capacity. So, with that, Corrine, is there anything you want to say about the Chinese market?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. We still are seeing a lot of discussion about the environmental protection mandate that we've seen around the Yangtze River. The situation is still evolving, and our local team has been doing a lot of work to try and get updates for us regularly. They are reporting reduced rock production at some of the mines and increased cost related to the gypsum disposal and some producers are having real proximity challenges. They're too close to the river and they're being threatened with either closures or relocation to get a little more distance. So, that economic pressure in total on these producers is really starting to add up. We're seeing their cost structure go up and they're having to fully cover their costs and that's part of why you're seeing these higher asking prices on their offers for exports.","If you look at DAP, MAP and triple exports, they are down for the first six months of the year modestly, about 4% down. But it is starting to take effect. All that said, of course, with these strong stripping margins, it is really difficult to anticipate the pace of the restructuring. But like Joc said, in the long run, we anticipate you're going to have really a smaller but financially healthier Chinese industry in the long run.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And so let me just reiterate. Our criteria for restarting Plant City will be a real perceived longer term need for that product in the market. We don't see that today but that may change in the future.","Operator","Our next question.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Next question?","Operator","Okay sir. Our next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. A two-part question on Mosaic Fertilizantes if you don't mind. First is just first impressions, I know you've been down there for six months and kind of what's your next steps here? The second is a little bit more math. In your Q1 earnings, you talked about one-third of the realized synergies in the first half and two-thirds in the second half. Now, you're saying $56 million so far. Does that mean we have another $112 million in the second half or how should I think about that?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. I'll come back to the math in a second here, Jonas, by the way, good morning. Thank you.","Jonas I. Oxgaard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Morning.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. First impressions of Mosaic Fertilizantes, I think our first impressions have been that the opportunities were at least as good or better than what we had hoped for. We've seen an extremely energized team. Probably, the most encouraging perspective from my point of view is how energized the new Mosaic employees are about making the changes and really becoming part of the Mosaic team. They're very excited about being part of a group that's focused on crop nutrition and delivery of crop nutrition. So, that's really encouraging. As you kind of indicate, our synergy capture has been at least as good or better than what we could have hoped for.","So now let me come back to the Q1 earnings question in terms of \u2013 or, sorry, the synergy question. First half of the year, yes, we have $56 million of gross synergies. Net of cost to achieve though, we're more like $34 million, and we said we would achieve $100 million including net of the cost to achieve. So, two-thirds of the next year, we have or next quarter, we have to achieve about $66 million to the bottom line. And we're certainly running at a rate that will give us that.","And then, we're encouraged that we might do better than that. We're running at a very good run rate and we will be very well positioned not only for achieving the $100 million but going into 2019 in a very good position to achieve the $175 million.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. It's really a two-part question. In your China phosphate export data, what you show is DAP up about 10%, but MAP down by about a third and TSP is also up. What do you make of the decrease in MAP shipments but the increase in DAP shipments?","And secondly, in the third quarter in your Brazilian operations, are there more turnaround costs or trucking issues or other cost inflation that you might note that would carry over from the second quarter?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Well, thanks, Jeff. I'm going to hand the China question over to Mike, but let me comment a little bit about the \u2013 particularly the risks in the third quarter. Certainly, most of the turnarounds were in the second quarter, as we head into the main fertilizer season we need our plants to be running well and be in good shape, which is why we take the turnarounds outside of the quarter. In terms of the trucking issues, the big issue there from our perspective is that the strike that started, it really impacted second quarter and it will probably come a little bit into third quarter because of cost of goods, but we've certainly covered that in our guidance.","The biggest area of concern there is while the trucking tables have been implemented by the government, a lot of people believe that it is unconstitutional and anti-competitive. So, they don't believe that that was implemented correctly. So, the government is yet to find really what we'd call a workable solution there. So, the main exposure is from product sales, which include freight, and that we entered into before the strike. Now, in these cases, we still have uncertainty and don't have the kind of clarity we need for the implementation of that freight rate table. So, there is unknown exposure there which we have incorporated into our guidance.","However, there is also the risk because there is a lack of a clear resolution. There's always a risk of further disruption by the truckers. We don't think that's likely. But we do believe it is a risk and it's one risk that we can't really plan for because it is obviously an unknown. Hopefully, that helps. But generally, the biggest risk to Brazil right now, we've got a good book of sales on. It's just execution and making sure that that trucking works.","Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Oh and sorry, China. Let me hand that straight to Mike. I think he's got a pretty good handle on the S&Ds.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Good morning, Jeff. I think the numbers that you see in the first half are really indicative of the changes that we expect to accelerate in China over the next several years. One, the increase in DAP imports is driven largely by strong demand in India or a rebound in Indian imports this year, and that is being supplied by typically large integrated players who have more modern plants that are not located on the river and the like. The big drop in MAP production really reflects some of the economics of the non-integrated players that are mostly along the river where, as Corrine mentioned before, they're incurring higher costs and more stringent environmental regulations that are difficult to comply with. And as a result, we're seeing a 33% reduction in exports there. So, bottom line, I think it's just indicative of things to come.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Ian Bennett - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. This is Ian Bennett on for Steve. Following up on the back of Jeff's question, it seems that not only China is exporting less MAP, but also your largest competitor in OCP is exporting less MAP and more DAP. Can you comment on your price realizations across DAP and MAP, how those have progressed in the first half of the year and the ability to switch production, as well as if you think those markets will remain in similar pricing levels or there will be any divergences? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks, Ian. I'm going to hand this over to Corrine to talk about the price differences between MAP and DAP and some of those progressions. What I will say, however, is from a production perspective we have a strong ability to produce the products that the market needs. So, we're driven more by market demand than we are about the ability to produce one or the other. So, we're switching those products all the time to better serve the market. Corrine, do you want to talk about the price realizations?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Thanks for the question, Ian. It's actually a good point. With the idling of our Plant City facility which produced quite a bit of DAP, we have seen a little bit of an increase in the DAP price relative to MAP overall in our market. That, combined with the other factors that you noticed a little less, MAP exports out of China, we are seeing a little bit of a increase in DAP price overall as Joc mentioned. We've got the flexibility to be able to produce the products that our customers want. But we do have quite a bit of production on our MicroEssentials products now and that is basically a MAP based pricing product. Mike, you want to add something?","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Just in terms of fundamentals as Corrine said, there's stronger DAP import demand by the U.S. given the idling of Plant City. Indian DAP demand has been very strong. And on the flip side, MAP exports into Brazil are off to a slower start this year. We expect them to pick up. So, I think we're seeing some changes in that price relationship already with MAP prices recovering some of their premium. And I think that probably will continue given the strong import demand that we expect in Brazil second half of the year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is open.","Ben Isaacson - Scotia Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Can you talk a little bit about MicroEssentials. You had record volume this past quarter. How are those markets doing in Brazil and the U.S. and where does growth come from in the future and maybe you could triangulate that with where you stand with the patents and when those come off patent, what are your expectations from the competition? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Ben. Let me start by just giving you the main markets. We obviously started in the U.S. because that's our key market and we developed the product and the research and whatnot in the U.S., Brazil and Central America became the second target area. And frankly, quite soon, we're going to be running up against production limitations. Again, we have capacity to produce close to 2.5 million tonnes, but that, we're going to start hitting that production limit not too far out. So, we're going to have to look at what's next for MicroEssentials. It's been such a successful product around the world that we believe that there will be an opportunity to expand that further.","In terms of the patents, I might just hand that over to Mark Isaacson, our General Counsel, in a second. But let me say one thing. As much as anything, our knowledge in how to produce and the scale of production of MicroEssentials plus the 10 years of proven in-the-field results have made it very difficult for anyone to come in and do a me-too with or without the patent situation.","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Ben, thanks so much for noting. This was a record production and sales quarter for MicroEssentials, and it just shows the success that we are having with the product. Overall, pricing has been maintained at the levels relative to MAP in all of our markets, and demand has been strong and growing. As Joc says, we're going to have to start to think about the further growth from there in production. And in terms of the patent, I'll turn over to Mark Isaacson.","Mark J. Isaacson - The Mosaic Co.","Right. Even though the primary MicroEssentials patent will be expiring in a few years here, we also have improvements that have been made to that product, that we will be filing patents for. And then we have already \u2013 and as Joc mentioned, really, much of the MicroEssentials technology is in trade secrets and in operating knowledge that allow us to make them in the quantities and the quality that we can.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Donald David Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Yes. Thank you. A question for Mike Rahm, in slide 17 and 18, you outlined your demand expectations for P&K. What do you see on the supply side? How do you see operating rates globally unfolding as we go through 2018 into 2019 and as some of this new capacity starts up?","And then just as a follow-up on Brazil, what's the overall impact of rising freight rates? Does that affect you more as a domestic producer or does it create a higher price umbrella because it'll lead to higher freight costs on a relative basis for imports of phosphate into Brazil?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Let's, Mike, you go ahead and give the first part to that, please.","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Yeah, Don. Thanks for the question. Good morning. Yeah, if you look at those charts, there's certainly a very good demand story unfolding. I should note that we have revised up our shipment estimates for the past couple of years based on new trade information from various sources including the International Fertilizer Association. And when you look at our projections for 2019, they do reflect a bit more modest growth from a much higher base.","And I would emphasize that those are our initial forecasts. We'll see how demand plays out, in particular, how ag commodity prices move. We've seen a big drop-off in June, but they are rebounding very nicely given a much smaller global crop than what was anticipated especially for wheat. When you lay that up against increases in capacity, in the case of phosphate, we basically see a deficit in 2018 first half. We think that deficit was close to 0.5 million tonnes for the year. It could be in that 700,000 to 1 million tonne range.","And what we've said in the past several earnings calls is that we're not saying the world is going to run out of phosphate. All we're saying is that prices and margins need to probably increase as they have to levels that maybe trim a little bit of demand and also stimulate a little bit more supply from various sources. And for 2019, when we look at those changes, given what we think will be a significant reduction in exports from China next year, we think that deficit situation likely will continue well into 2019 even with the continued ramp-up of the additional capacity.","And the same really holds true for potash as well. There are some puts and takes obviously on the supply side, with some facilities winding down production and others ramping up. But the bottom line is we see a balanced to tight situation in the global potash market through at least the end of next year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","In answer to your second question, Don, clearly one of the advantages of our Mosaic Fertilizantes business is the proximity to the key agricultural markets. So, freight is a much lower component of our cost structure in Brazil than it would be for an imported product. As such, we expect that in general we have a freight advantage and proportionally our freight advantage would increase with the cost of freight.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Adam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. A question on phosphate in North America. Between the closure of \u2013 or idling of Plant City and Nutrien closing the Redwater plant by the end of the year, the North American market import requirements are going up by a pretty meaningful amount. I just was interested to hear your thoughts on the market structure and pricing structure where the U.S. continues to trade at a pretty healthy discount to the export prices or import equivalents from Brazil, which is not the best net back market for Moroccan or Russian product, and how do you think the market structure evolves over the next 18 months if that discount persists? And how do you think about your own sales mix in that context?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thank you, Adam. Yeah. Let me start by saying, clearly, the import requirements into the U.S. are increasing by both Redwater and Plant City, there is no question of that. I suspect some of the Redwater plant may be brought up by other production within the Nutrien group. I'm not sure of that, but it certainly indicates that there will be a need for more imports and those imports have not been coming into the U.S. market at the rate they might need to because of the discount that we're seeing at the New Orleans price. Over time, they will have to equalize those price to drive the redistribution of fertilizers from the Brazil market. So, in other words the U.S. will have to pay up or the fertilizer will go to the Brazil and other markets rather than the U.S. So, I mean, free market systems mean these have to work out over time and we think that's positive for the U.S. market.","Anything to add, Corrine?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","No. I think the only thing I would add is you asked about Mosaic's own export sales and we do have a pretty heavy export lineup coming up. These markets in Brazil and other areas have been pulling product pretty hard. We are starting to see a few more vessels into the lineup into the U.S. market. I think it indicates people are starting to become aware of the need for this market to move up and draw some more tonnes into the country.","Mike, do you want to add?","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","The only thing I would add is that June statistics came out and we have a complete picture for the 2017-2018 fertilizer year that ended on June 30. And, indeed, we did see record phosphate imports into the U.S. of about 2.5 million tonnes. The only thing I would add on North America is that there's some really interesting things, I think, going on in the market. When you look at the implied shipments in North America, they are trending upward. And I think that reflects the fact that these massive crops have taken lots of nutrients out of the soil and this is a market that has grown significantly in the past five years.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Andrew Wong - RBC Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Just going back to Brazil and not to belabor it, but I understand there's some uncertainty with the trucker tables and, as of now, it's a little bit difficult to tell. But can you just tell us what the freight costs are per tonne and how that's changed, and how much of the cost can be passed down the chain?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sorry, Andrew. Microphone. Yeah. I can answer part of that. Obviously, the actual table is extremely complicated, and I don't think we can give you that level of clarity. But what I can tell you is yes, once we get new contracts, those will be incorporating the new freight rates into them. But the main exposure right now is sales we did before the strike. So, in other words, we have a contract of affreightment at one rate, but the new table is at a different rate. So, the question is, do the truckers honor the old rate which they entered a contract with us, or do they try to achieve the new rate? And what that number is, is about $6 per tonne of risk on those sales we've already entered into. So, we may or may not see those. And as we go through, first, our third quarter, more and more of those old contracts are used up and sold. So, the exposure gets less and less over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Joel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)","Hi. Good morning, Joc. Maybe a two-parter on potash. Your MOP cash costs have been pretty stable of the last year. Would you expect that over the next year or so? Of course, Q3 is a little bit higher because of turnarounds.","And second part, you didn't raise your potash volume guidance. Your Canpotex partner, Nutrien did, by a few hundred thousand tonnes. Any thinking about that, why you didn't raise your volume, but your Canpotex partner did? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. Joel, thanks. I will answer each of those questions quite a bit separately. MOP cash costs were clearly impacted to some extent by both turnarounds in the second quarter, but also by the problems we had with transport in the first quarter carrying over into the second quarter. So, I think that's the high end of where we would expect our cost to be over the next little while. But clearly, those costs being there or a little bit lower is where we expect the cost going.","In terms of potash volume guidance, we have a different rev rec standard, so it could be just that what's being recognized is revenue is a little bit different and that leads to that difference. Other than that, I'm not really sure I know what Nutrien's rationale is or what the thinking behind that is. We've simply looked at our markets and added them up and said this is where we expect to see revenue recognition.","Mike, do you want to?","Mike Rahm - The Mosaic Co.","I guess the only thing I would add, Joel, is that we really haven't revised our 2018 shipment number that much. We took it up, I think, couple of hundred thousand tonnes. So, we haven't changed our view of the market maybe as much as some of the competitors have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. It's Dan Jester on for P.J. Maybe just a question for Mike. On phosphates in India, domestic production is down pretty substantially so far this year. So, just wondering if you can comment on some of the drivers of that? And as we look forward, do you think India is going to be met with more import needs or is there a scenario where that domestic production can come back? Thanks.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Dan, and good morning. Yeah, I think it's pretty well understood that production economics in India, we would like to call them fabrication economics, were unfavorable given the high relative cost of phosphoric acid. So, I think production first half of the year was down significantly and I think to the tune of 500,000 tonnes or so. I don't have that number in front of me.","One of the things they have done is they have lowered the GST on imported phosphoric acid so that, we think, going forward you may see a little bit of a ramp-up of production there. Bottom line is we expect about 5.5 million tonnes of imports, and we do think that production probably recovers a little bit over the next several months and we'd probably end the calendar year with production in that maybe 4.2 million tonne, 4.3 million tonne range.","And I think longer term India is always going to look out for a diversified source of phosphate. So, we don't see domestic fabrication growing dramatically over time. And as demand increases, we do think most of the increase in demand likely will be met by greater imports.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is open.","John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. Nutrien is talking about possibly consolidating the non-soybean retail market in Brazil. I think of Mosaic has more distribution than retail in Brazil, but I'm not always sure where distribution ends and retail begins. Do you have any parts of your network that might be non-core or, on the other side, does your balance sheet even allow you to participate in any further consolidation if you wanted to?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Hello, John. Thanks for that. The structure of the Brazil business or the Brazil market is quite a bit different than what I would call the North American retail. So, as you say, it's kind of hard to determine what is retail and what is distribution. We sell to a lot of very large farmers, but we also sell into some smaller retails. It's a very fragmented type of industry there.","And again, I can't comment on what our competitors are doing or thinking. What I would say, though, is we believe we've built a very good competitive business in Brazil. We believe the synergies between our distribution business and our production business gives us a real competitive advantage and a real first-mover advantage into those core markets. And the other models for that, we'll just wait and see and see how they work and we'll obviously respond to what that means to the competitive landscape. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, I'm just wondering if you guys could give us a little bit more \u2013 I know you said you're going to talk more about K3 on your next call, but just talk about kind of where you see yourself on a cash cost per tonne for potash, and then follow-up would be just any updates on when we might see India or China settle potash contract.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Thanks, Michael. Yeah. On K3, let me give you an update on where we're at and we will talk more about this in future calls and the reason we didn't talk about it today is more that if anything, we are in the process of shutting down and doing a turnaround at K2. And one of the big projects during that turnaround will be to tie in the conveyor from K3 to K2, which means that we can start ramping up K3 from a production perspective somewhere in this third quarter. So, we're very encouraged with where that is going.","K3, we fully expect will be one \u2013 and particularly, once we eliminate the brine inflow costs at K2, K3 will be one of the lowest cost \u2013 cash cost projects in the world, certainly one of the most efficient potash mines in the world. So, that's our expectation there. We'll talk more about expectations of cash costs in the future.","In terms of the India-China contract, look, two things on that. They both will need fertilizer. They both will need potash at some point. Today, those contracts are in process. I don't like to talk about any contracts that Canpotex is in the middle of. I don't think that's a good thing to do in a public forum.","But I will tell you that the rest of the world is demanding potash. Our volume movements are very good. And I think the impact of these contracts long term is becoming less and less of a bellwether. I'd also say, at least in our quarter three, our guidance includes very little volume, particularly from China. So, it doesn't have a big impact on where we're going in the next three months or so. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. You've seen the Moroccans do a pretty good job developing that African market in terms of NPS and some other inputs. On this front, can you just talk about MicroEssentials current spread versus DAP\/MAP, and then also give us a sense of any of your other longer term agronomic development efforts specifically in the P front and anything in LatAm and India in particular? Thank you.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Okay. Thanks, Chris. Yeah. I would concur that \u2013 I mean, from the outside looking in, OCP has done a very good job of developing the African market. And I think that's great for society overall. So we're pleased to see both the development of the market and the contribution to Africa in general. So we're glad to see that.","Obviously, our MES products, our MicroEssentials products go to somewhat different markets. In terms of the spread over DAP and MAP, there's really two pieces to that. And I'm going to let Corrine talk about this a bit, but we maintain a price relative to MAP and that has a constant premium in some cases that has not changed. But then we also make part of our increased margin is because the inputs into MicroEssentials are different than the inputs into DAP and MAP. So the cost structure is more favorable for our MicroEssentials product. It's basically the thing.","So, you can't just look at price, but you will see over time a price premium for the MicroEssentials products, particularly in markets like Brazil. Corrine, do you want to follow that on?","Corrine D. Ricard - The Mosaic Co.","Sure. When we talk about MicroEssentials, there are a number of different products within that group of products, and so, we've got different pricing for each one of those relative to the micronutrients, the sulfur content, et cetera. As Joc mentioned, the pricing premium is relative to MAP or DAP has been maintained. And even with our growth that we've seen in the markets, we have been able to maintain those pricing premium. I think you also asked about other new products. Mosaic does spend a fair amount of time working on other new products. We have launched some new micronutrient enhanced potash products, and we are working on further developments in our phosphate line of products. Stay tuned for more information about those as we develop them, get them in the market.","Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time to take our last question from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Just two things. Joc, you proposed shifting from FOB to CFR in Brazil, and I'm just curious what the response to that has been. And second, these brine costs look like they're in really good shape. Is that where you expect them to be in the second half?","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Yeah, look, our preference with this level of uncertainty will be to enter into more CFR contracts in Brazil \u2013 or sorry \u2013 FOB contracts in Brazil to, let's say, move the freight risk from our system. That's not always possible, but that is a focus we would have, and we have to find a way of mitigating that risk or we have to price it into our offerings. So, I mean, easy to do, sometimes more challenging to implement because you do have MOUs and long-term customers where you've got a certain way of selling. So, we'll either have to incorporate it into our pricing or move that risk over to our customers at the time.","Now, in terms of brine costs, yes, we've been doing a \u2013 the potash team's been doing a great job on brine management and brine cost. If you remember, we put a fair bit of money into some technological improvements, I guess, about three or four years ago.","And that, along with just good cost management, have really helped us control that brine cost for a number of years now. So, we're feeling pretty good about it. Obviously the long-term solution is to eliminate it altogether, but it is well controlled, and we do not expect any real variation. Obviously Mother Nature plays a role, but we do not expect any real variation in the second half of the year.","James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.","And, sorry, and just with that, I'd just like to wrap up by saying, again, our company is well-positioned here, and I want to just reiterate our key performance issues.","Our business is performing well. We're generating substantial cash as a result of both better market conditions and our business transformations. Second, we're making extremely good progress on our Mosaic Fertilizantes business in Latin America, and we continue to feel good about the acquisition. And third, we're optimistic that our momentum will continue and accelerate as we move into the end of this year.","To sum it up, Mosaic continues to be well positioned to deliver attractive returns as these business conditions continue to improve.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the Company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today\u2019s call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Mrs. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our second quarter 2019 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mossaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to, statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our first quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to today\u2019s Form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","James O'Rourke","Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. As you know, the spring planting season in North America was challenging. It was the wettest and latest season on record. In fact, we believe U.S. farmers were prevented from planting at least 10 million acres.","We now have seen two consecutive application seasons negatively impacted by weather, which in turn has driven grain prices to multiple year highs and incented farmers to make sure they are prepared to take advantage of those prices in 2020. Clearly, these same events have also impacted our first half results and tempered our full-year financial outlook.","Clint will give you the details to understand the factors that drove our second quarter earnings. I will focus on the actions we are taking to adopt the progress we are continuing to make across the business and our longer-term outlook. Our key points today are; first, we expect the current North American inventories to be reduced shapely through an anticipated strong fall application season and we see much stronger fundamentals for agriculture and fertilizer emerging in 2020.","Second, our success in ramping up Esterhazy K3 combined with our inventory position has given us the flexibility to curtail our highest cost potash mine and focused on our lowest cost operations. This action is expected to drive potash cost even lower in the second half of 2019 and save $40 million to $50 million in cash expenditures.","Third, we expect to have all our Brazilian phosphate mines running in August ahead of schedule and we are lowering the down related costs by $20 million from our previous estimate. Last, we've announced the permanent closure of our Plant City phosphates facility, which will improve our overall phosphate cost position and cash flow going forward. The transformation we have driven across our business units has increased Mosaic\u2019s cross-cycle potential and has allowed us increase flexibility to adapt to a changing environment. The impact of our actions to increase our operating leverage is expected to coincide with improving market conditions.","The North American crop, which received much less fertilizer than usual will leave fields in serious need of nutrient replenishment. At the same time, higher grain prices will provide strong incentives for farmers to plant more acres and to maximize yields next spring.","Of course, North America is just one market, demand remains strong in Brazil where the farmers are seeking to maximize output in response to a favorable market conditions and as we move into their peak planting season.","In India, the monsoon is picking up and the recent government decision to leave phosphates subsidies unchanged is strongly positive for the long-term demand picture. In China, phosphate demand was down, offsetting some of the strong growth elsewhere. While the slower demand originally drove exports, we're now seeing phosphate exports decline as lower prices impact phosphate producer economics.","While today's lower phosphate prices are challenging in the short-term, we believe they can accelerate the restructuring of the Chinese industry. Year-end 2019 represents a milestone with investment required for many producers to maintain environmental compliance and current lower prices are likely to prevent some of those investments. It is our belief that marginal producers will cease production, as we move into 2020. The larger Chinese producers have announced a coordinated curtailment of production, which we are closely watching.","Now I will turn to our execution, which is driving important benefits across the organization. I will start with Potash. Our new Esterhazy K3 mine is performing exceptionally well. We believe it will produce 400,000 tons of Potash in 2019 and we'll approach a million tons in 2020. This incremental production at Esterhazy help to facilitate the decision to temporarily idle Colonsay and allows us to begin to realize the benefits of one of the most efficient mines in the world.","We continue to drive cash costs of production lower in the Potash business. In the second quarter of 2019, our cash cost of production excluding brine fell to $69 per ton and we expect cost to continue to improve as operating rates increase.","With the savings related to an idle Colonsay mine, we expect these cost to fall to approximately $60 a ton in the fourth quarter. That said Colonsay will remain in a position to deliver 2.5 million tons of annual surge capacity if necessary to meet market demand.","Our business in Brazil also continues to perform very well and we are seeing momentum for the second half of the year and beyond. Mosaic Fertilizantes is on track to achieve its $275 million synergy target ahead of schedule and we expect to drive significant transformational savings after we complete the deal related synergy work.","In addition, we have made tremendous progress towards meeting the new mine, tailings down regulatory standard. Mosaic has completed the first phase of dam remediation at the top your mind and has restarted mining at roughly 60% capacity.","The mine is expected to resume full operations by the middle of August after completing remediation activities on a second dam. The Company has also received an operating license for the B6 dam at Arax\u00e1, which is expected to allow that mine to start operations this month.","Our teams in Brazil have done remarkable work to get us to this point, reducing the expected impact by $20 million for the full-year. In the phosphates business, we are continuing to exert pressure on factors that we can control. The transformation of our phosphates business is ongoing and it is driving significant operational and financial efficiency while simultaneously delivering excellent safety and environmental results.","To be clear, our focus will remain on meeting the needs of our customers and maintaining our market position that will not change. External factors have impacted our results in near-term expectations and have led us to reduce our 2019 EBITDA guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion.","However, we've retained our keen focus on execution and controlling what is within our power. Our ability to improve efficiency, lower cost and optimize assets has created significant operating leverage in our business. Our outlook for the second half remain strong and we continue to expect broad strengths in our markets and our business in 2020 and the years ahead.","Now I'm going to turn it over to Clint to provide further detail.","Clint Freeland","Thank you, Joc, and good morning, everyone. As noted earlier, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for the second quarter totaled $349 million and $0.12 per share respectively. As solid results at the Potash and Fertilizantes business units were offset by a difficult quarter in phosphates.","Potash adjusted EBITDA totaled $254 million for the quarter, up 27% from $199 million last year as a modest reduction in sales volume resulting from the week spring fertilizer application season in North America was more than offset by much stronger margins.","Mosaic Fertilizantes adjusted EBITDA totaled $38 million during the quarter compared to $60 million for the second quarter of 2018, results this year include $36 million in non-recurring costs to supplement rock and finished goods supply as our team work to bring our Brazilian mine tailings dams into compliance with the new regulatory standard. Except for that, adjusted EBITDA would have been $74 million, up 23%.","The Phosphate segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $74 million during the quarter, compared to $251 million in the same quarter last year as sales prices, sales volume, and mix idle costs and raw material costs, all pressured results. Additionally, equity earnings associated with our investment in modern, flow through the Phosphate segment and for the quarter we're loss of $11 million.","Well, the segments cash gross margin before DD&A and accretion was a positive $47 per ton, reported adjusted gross margin per ton for the quarter was negative $5. Considerably lower than expected as a number of dynamics came together to impact results. As a result of week spring demand and a high level of imports trapped in the lower Mississippi river, market prices remained under pressure and the seasonal price improvement we typically see in the second quarter did not materialize.","Additionally, while the Midwest warehouse premium in North America remained high, we didn't capture as much of that as anticipated as North American sales, including MicroEssentials products where 350,000 to 400,000 tons lower than expected. Lower market prices along with the change in the mix of sales during the quarter and lower than expected production in sale volumes impacted margins by $45 per ton.","The volume and mix shift includes the impact of redirecting approximately 150,000 incremental tons of fertilizer to our international distribution businesses, primarily Brazil, and these intercompany international sales had lower margins than in North America. In addition, with overall production volumes below expectations as a result of the opportunistic extension of two plan maintenance outages, we saw higher conversion cost per ton and slower declines in raw material costs during the period.","These factors taken together led to the quarters results. However, it's important to note that the volume and mix impacts in the second quarter gross margin are transitory and are not expected to impact third quarter results. Additionally, as sales accelerate in the third quarter, we expect approximately $12 per ton in raw material cost improvement relative to the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of these benefits is a decline in average selling prices compared to last quarter reflecting recent market pricing levels.","Third quarter gross margin per ton expectations for the Potash business reflect the $25 per ton discount offered to customers as part of our North American summer fill program, as well as expenses associated with schedule turnaround activity during the period.","And while we expect to realize significant cash savings from the idling of our Colonsay facility as Joc mentioned earlier. We expect only a small portion of that to impact the Company's third quarter earnings as we sell down existing inventory at the facility. Margin benefits from migrating production to our lower cost K3 facility should be more significant in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2020.","Finally, our margin guidance for Mosaic Fertilizantes reflects the higher cost associated with purchased rock and finished product as part of our dam remediation activities. However, as mentioned earlier, we expect these to be transistorizes operations return to normal. As we look out to the balance of the year, our expectations are for a robust fall application season given depleted soil nutrients in North America and higher grain prices benefiting farmer economics.","Outside of North America, we expect to see continued strong demand, particularly in Brazil. We're farmer economics remains solid. As a result, we see total second half volumes for potash in a range of 4.7 million to 5.1 million tons, which would equal or break Mosaic\u2019s previous records second half sales levels. Phosphate shipments in the second half are expected to be 4.4 million to 4.8 million tons, the highest level since idling of Plant City.","In addition to these strong sales volumes, we expect inventories in North America to be substantially drawn down. One of the key things to watch as we get into the fall is the length of the application window in North America given the late spring planting and resulting later harvest.","In Brazil, we continue to expect Fertilizantes to deliver full-year sales volumes of 9.4 million to 9.8 million tons, reflecting continued market strength in our successful remediation of the issues created by the regulatory driven closures of our Brazilian mines. With this strong demand is backdrop in both North America and Brazil keeping in mind existing inventory levels, we would expect market prices to remain stable if not improved somewhat over the balance of the year.","So taking first half results into account and our expectations for the balance of the year, we've updated our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.8 billion to $2 billion and earnings per share range to $1.10 to $1.50.","In addition to the volume assumptions outlined earlier, there are a number of factors that are incorporated into our forecast, including first, from a pricing standpoint, the low end of our guidance range assumes market pricing at the beginning of the third quarter for all remaining unpriced tons this year.","While the top end of the range reflects an average price increase of $25 per ton across both phosphates and potash. Next, we expect raw material costs to improve, as noted earlier, as we realize the benefits from recent market price declines.","Next as Joc mentioned, we now expect our minds in Brazil to be back to full operation this month, reducing the total cost of managing through the dam issue this year from our original estimate of $100 million to $80 million. With modern slowly ramping up production the weaker phosphate pricing environment coupled with the projects interest costs are now expected to result in equity earnings to Mosaic of approximately negative $50 million for the year.","And finally, expectations of cash taxes have declined from $75 million to $50 million. Our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to remain in the mid-to-high 20% range. The biggest impact of our effective rate is earnings mix. So that remains the item to watch going forward.","Turning into our CapEx plans for the year, we've reduced our 2019 sustaining capital program by $80 million to $640 million in light of market conditions. We are however, continuing to invest in modest high return opportunities like the modifications to our dock in Louisiana that will allow us to use more of our own internally produced ammonia in our Florida operations. Generating an unlevered after tax return of over 40% and payback of right at two years.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joc for his closing comments.","James O'Rourke","Thank you, Clint. There was no question the market conditions have been difficult for the first half of this year. And that the impact on the full-year will be real. We have solid strategic momentum; markets notwithstanding; we have improved our cost base and our operating efficiency; we have successfully integrated and transformed a compelling acquisition in the world's most promising agricultural market.","We are just beginning to realize the very long-term benefit of the new Esterhazy K3 potash mine and we are performing at a very high level across the organization. We expect the current supply and demand situation will come into balance and as it does Mosaic will remain in excellent position to benefit.","Now we will take your questions ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Stephen Byrne.","Stephen Byrne","Yes. As to whether you're seeing a behavior change down in Brazil with the improving corn market. Are you seeing expectations of maybe a bigger second corn crop? Any increased buying patterns on fertilizer earlier than normal or a little more aggressive on volume?","James O'Rourke","Thank you, Steve. Welcome. Well, I'll hand this to Rick. We have the privilege of having Rick McLellan here in the room today and he manages our Brazil business. But I can tell you, I think the motive in Brazil to take advantage of some of the issues, higher corn pricing and some of the trade issues that are now occurring. We expect we will be very positive for Brazil. Rick, do you want to talk about the season coming up?","Richard McLellan","Yes. Good morning, Steve. So the season coming up, if we look across the main crops, if you look at corn, soybeans, cotton and citrus farmer returns are very, very good. And so we see a really good sales book on now for our distribution business and we expect a very good main application period. Your question was about safrina the second crop. And yes, we've seen farmers in the last two to three weeks step in and start to buy their fertilizer for the second crop corn. And that's a very positive indicator, but it also tells you that there is a market there for that corn and the farmers were reacting and the market is working.","James O'Rourke","And let me just remind you that we're going to be bringing back Tapira and Arax\u00e1 just in time for the big season coming up. So we think our B2B business is going to be in very good shape as well to take advantage.","Stephen Byrne","And how do you look at the growth potential for Fertilizantes down there? You have 14 blending facilities. Would you prioritize expanding that particularly as more rails get constructed in Brazil or could you envision a diversification of the product offering at these facilities such as, moving in the more distribution of other products, crop chemicals, seed treatments, et cetera?","James O'Rourke","Thanks. I think both of those are really good opportunities for us. First one, expanding our distribution platform itself and capturing a bigger piece of that overall market is a really good opportunity for us. But obviously expanding and using those platforms for other commodities is another growth opportunity. We got into Brazil on the basis. We believe it's one of the best agricultural regions in the world growing at a great rate and we fully think we're a first-mover in there and we're going to take advantage of that first-mover advantage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vincent Andrews.","Vincent Andrews","Thank you. Joc, maybe I could just ask you how you're thinking about sort of the bridge from 2019 to 2020 in terms of volume. And I guess what I'm asking is, obviously we saw reduced usage in the U.S. this year and maybe in Europe as well. So are you thinking we get that back and then you get normal growth on top of what should have been the underlying demand growth this year? Or have we rebased 2019 volume or shipments and we'll just get normal growth off of that?","James O'Rourke","Thanks Vincent. I'll start this and hand it over to our more of our market analysis people. But I think everyone understands that we had an unprecedented on North American spring, but that's behind us today. And what's it left? It's left to prevent planting up to 10 million acres, so we expect coming out of the season a stock to use ratios, maybe as low as 10%. Well that's going to really push grain prices and really going to push planting intentions up for the spring.","So our expectation is we're going to have a big spring in North America and we fully expect big volumes coming out in 2020. So if we bridge from 2019 to 2020, we expect to have a much higher acreage or higher acreage and we expect to have higher application to support that and then the rest of the world will follow. Anything from you, Karen or Andy?","Andy Jung","I think just from a specificity standpoint, we won't make up all of the tons that didn't go down last year or in 2019. We'll make up some of them. But we'll just return to a more broad-based linear demand growth pattern in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Roberts.","John Roberts","Thank you. How should we think about the Fertilizantes earning split between the third and fourth quarter? The third quarters, I think normally seasonally bigger, but you still have \u2013 you don't have your full capabilities back in the third quarter. So should we think about earnings being roughly equal between third and fourth quarter Fertilizantes rather than the normal seasonality?","James O'Rourke","Yes. Thanks, John. Look, the split between the third and fourth quarter, as you said, normally we would expect them to be just as last year, which is a third quarter, slightly bigger than the fourth. But I think this year, we have still another somewhere around $40 million of raw material pricing for rock and whatnot that we had to import for the dams. So overall, volumes are going to be up. But we're going to still be absorbing a little bit of the dam cost for another quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard.","Jonas Oxgaard","Good morning, guys. A question in the first quarter, both you and your big African competitor shutdown some capacity in phosphate. Just the market didn't seem to need it. In Q2 that it didn't seem that anyone did and I haven't turned any announcements that's happening in Q3 either, yet pricing is continuing to be weak. Can you talk a little bit about the strategic backdrop of why not taking out a just in Q2 and how you think about it going forward?","James O'Rourke","Yes. Thanks, Jonas. Let me hand this to Corrine in a second here. But I'll just let me give you the high level. Obviously, we did take capacity out in Q1 and into Q2, which you see in our sales results. And as such, our inventory build probably isn't as big as some of the others and also means that we want to be ready for \u2013 what comes up in a big third and fourth quarter.","So we think for ourselves at least in our market position, those tons are needed. We don't believe that the demand picture is a long-term demand issue. It was a short-term thing driven by a bad U.S. spring.","Corrine Ricard","Yes. Well, I would add Jonas that the logistics complications that we faced during spring season have been \u2013 were significant and Mosaic's operating rate was maintained with lots of real shipment and shipment to upcountry warehouses that was difficult for others to replicate based on barge positions.","I think we have some of the same risks in a very large fall season, that getting product up into the markets that need it for fall are going to require rail loading, and the kind of logistical capability that Mosaic is going to have. And so I think we'll be operating at full rates for the very large fall season that we anticipate.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Wong.","Andrew Wong","Hi, good morning. So maybe just following on that a little bit more on phosphates. I think it's fair to say that the prices in the market has been weaker this year than expected. So maybe just first, can you talk about what's kind of been the main factors driving that weakness? Is it supply? Is it demand? Maybe go through some of the various supply and demand situations in the main regions like China, India, Brazil, we know about U.S. obviously.","And then just secondly, like when do you expect prices to maybe, start seeing a little bit of a bottom and in a rebound and what are some of the catalysts that we can watch for ahead of that? Thanks.","James O'Rourke","Okay. That's a bit of a doozy, Andrew. I'll get through it and I'll get Karen to help me here. But let me at a high level say, look, we've had 10 years of relatively linear growth in our phosphate markets.","And for the first time, I think in \u2013 probably half a dozen years, the issue with the supply and demand has been about demand and it really is predicated on mostly on a U.S. bad spring, somewhat on a lowering Chinese demand. But really other than that, pretty much a normal linear growth for the demand for phosphates.","So what that's meant is the equivalent of probably about a new mine coming on all of the sudden. New production is not great. It's only about 1 million tons this year I believe. And so if not for this displacement of the U.S. spring, I think the market would have continued to be a quite balance and we do expect it to rebound as early as this fall and into the spring. Karen, do you want to add any detail to that?","Karen Swager","In terms of what happened this spring. I think Joc has covered it. We had a fall four season and then we had a disappointing spring season, probably about 800,000 tons of demand was loss. At the same time though we had 1 million tons more imports into the U.S. and so that really exacerbated the problem along with the flooding along the river. So these tons were trapped in the lower Mississippi and traders started liquidating those positions very aggressively when they couldn't get tons up in country in time for spring season.","And so that really caused on very small amounts of trade prices to drop quickly. But that fundamental demand issue is really going to be largely overcome as Andy noted with what we think will be a large fall season and going into 2020. And so when we see prices turning, we'll work through the inventory levels that have been carried out at the end of the spring season and we should see things tightening up as we get into 2020.","James O'Rourke","Yes. If I can just add, I mean we were hearing numbers of a corn plant of maybe 95 plus million acres next spring. If we're going to have that level of planting, it'll suck up the inventory very quickly.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Samuelson.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. So a couple of questions continuing in phosphates, first, on the \u2013 as we think about the price declines that we've seen year-to-date. I think talking about Russian and Moroccan tons are though just been cargoes that have been going on priced into NOLA and into Brazil had been an important contributing factor? Can you talk about just market structure? It just any visibility that distribution patterns can change here, it seems like some of those cargoes are being pretty disruptive to the market.","And then secondly, can you talk about the cost curve a little bit? It just with the magnitude of the price declines we've senior day and even with sulfur having come down, the fact that the Chinese kind a kept producing up until quite recently and even then the cuts mean to be seen, but just kind of how your view of the cost curve is evolved as the years progressed? Thank you. ","James O'Rourke","Okay. Thanks, Adam. Let me say, yes, first of all, the cargos from some of our competitors that kept coming into NOLA. I suppose some of that might be a misunderstanding or a missed prediction of what the spring would do, but there's no question these unpriced tons that are just shipped into these markets are pretty disruptive. And I think that's kind of the nature of that beast. So it really will take the tightening of the market to reverse that. But hopefully the tightening will come soon and that's good.","In terms of the cost curve, we don't have \u2013 I don't think we have a good cost curve in this business, but let me give you a couple of benchmarks, so I can kind of touch on. First of all, our main North American competitor reported a couple of weeks back or a week ago. They had in their Phosphate business cash margin of zero. The Chinese players are calculations; they have negative cash margins right now.","At least on modern two, I think Clint mentioned our equity earnings will be negative to about $50 million this year. I don't have information on the North Africans or the Russians, but clearly a big chunk of the cost curve is either breaking even or losing money in this market. So that really tells you that the pressure upwards on price is not far away.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly.","Joan Tong","Good morning.","James O'Rourke","Hello.","Joan Tong","Good morning. This is actually Joan Tong on for Mark Connelly. How are you guys doing? A question on Potash, obviously pretty strong results and performance there? I'm just wondering, given the outlook on potash, how long you're going to idle, the Colonsay mine, do you have an estimate there?","James O'Rourke","Sure, Joan. We didn't really give a time frame on what we would idle Colonsay from. Clearly it's a temporary idling and it's really more than anything, let's call it a cash preservation opportunity. Esterhazy K3 is ramping up very successfully, which will give us incremental tons. We had some inventory and so we felt with existing predictions we would make this year without needing any incremental tons from Colonsay.","Now that could change if the markets in the fall are better than we think. Colonsay may come up earlier, but we had planned somewhere around the end of the year being kind of our target for where we felt comfortable that with plants today that plant could be shutdown. But let me highlight, Colonsay is a 2 million ton, $100 a ton cash cost producer, and at 2 million tons it would be much better than that. We've been running at less than capacity. So that represents an incredible level of flexibility in the surge that we have available for us in a better market.","Joan Tong","That's great. Thank you. And then just looking at our questions on China, and what are you seeing in China in terms of grain demand? Just want to understand, like the African swine flu, obviously there are a lot of different view about how it's going to affect the grain demand, but we haven't seen grain demand falling off the cliff. And just wondering what you're seeing there. And also for China, E10 program, how realistic they are really going to move forward with that? Thank you.","James O'Rourke","Let me leave that one straight over to Karen and Andy.","Andy Jung","All right. So what we've seen on a grain demand standpoint in China is, like you said, it hasn't fallen off a cliff and we wouldn't expect it to. I mean, there's still a lot of people and those people still demand food. What we have seen is some switching, so a big increase in animal protein imports for the month of June both beef and pork imports were up about 60% year-over-year. So well we might see some switching out or product mix changes there, we don't expect that to be particularly meaningful to the global S&D in total.","And then from a E10 program, I think it\u2019s been relatively slow to be adopted, but it appears that they're continuing down that road. It just might take a little bit longer time horizon and one may have hoped for in the past.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Parkinson.","Christopher Parkinson","Thank you. So there's been a lot of movement in ammonia and sulfur prices for North American producers over the past few quarters, but there's obviously going to be a delay in the realization of lower inputs. Can you just comment on your outlook for strip margins for the balance of the year just the cadence of realizing those benefits? And then just any quick update on your longer-term efforts to further reduce rock costs will be incredibly helpful. Thank you.","Clint Freeland","Okay. Thanks Chris. Let me start with both the price of ammonia in the market and the price of sulfur in the market have come down significantly. One of the challenges for us today is with the market being slower, it takes longer for that raw material to move through our product into goods for sale, and then finally into our sales and cost of goods. So that takes time. At the best of time, we figure that takes at least six weeks for ammonia and probably more like three months for sulfur. In this case, it's probably three months plus for both of them. So you've got to take a quite a while.","If we look just at next month's prices or sorry, next quarters prices that we have seen today, I think we're expecting to be down in the range of $20 to $25 a ton just on flow through of these cost of goods. But that's going to take some time and that's going to take when the consumption comes through. So overall, we expect stripping margins to improve because of raw materials. But luckily that won't \u2013 likely, that won't come till the end of the third quarter or even into the fourth quarter before we see the meaningful drop translated into cost of goods.","Operator","Your next question comes from Duffy Fischer.","Patrick Fischer","Yes. Good morning. Two questions about \u2013 or two subjects on your shutdowns. So one, I thought I heard you say that the Plant City shutdown helps your cash flow, but because it's been idled for over a year that that struck me as strange. So can you just walk through how shutting down Plant City both impacts your P&L going forward? And then what are the shutdown costs? How would it affect the cash flow? And in just on Colonsay, say, you said you'd been running under the 2 million, what is the LTM production for Colonsay and when was that shutdown affected?","James O'Rourke","Okay. Let me start with Plant City. I think the issue there as we've been holding Plant City while not in hot ready. We've been holding it in a ready mode and we've continued to have it ready to be brought up if required. The decision to finally move it into shutdown mode does two things.","One, it reduces and stops those costs, obviously from a non-cash perspective at the stops, the depreciation because the depreciation was moved into a write-down. And then while we will have ARO costs or asset retirement costs, those will be not P&L based costs. So hopefully that helps on that one. And I'll hand it to Clint to give you maybe more detail on that.","And then Colonsay P&L, an effective date \u2013 effective date I think is early September \u2013 mid August and then the P&L impact, I got a separate P&L impact. It's going to depend on one things are sold, but we do know it will be about a $50 million cash savings. Clint, do you want to\u2026?","Clint Freeland","Sure. Hi, Duffy, this is Clint. So on Plant City, as that facility has been kept an idle status, the total idle cost associated with that has been about $50 million a year, about half of that is depreciation, half of that is cash. Now that it has been formerly closed and now we're going into ARO work that $50 million running through the P&L will be reduced to about $10 million, again about half of that on depreciation, about half of that in cash.","So certainly it will be beneficial to the P&L. As we go into ARO work, I think what we've said historically is that that would be roughly an average of, call it $20 million a year over the first five years. So I think from a cash standpoint, you're probably fairly flat from a P&L standpoint, you will see an improvement.","And then back to Colonsay, again I think you need to separate cash versus P&L impact. I think as we've talked about a little bit earlier, we will continue to sell down the inventory at that facility. And so while we do expect to see, call it $40 million to $50 million in cash benefit this year as it relates to the P&L in the flow through of costs.","In the near-term, we only think that there will be about a $5 million P&L benefit. However, as that inventory is fully sold and then we switched to selling the inventory coming out of K3, that $40 million to $50 million cash benefit will now P&L benefit. But that'll be \u2013 a little bit more delayed.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas.","Jeffrey Zekauskas","Thanks very much. Your ammonia costs came down a tiny bit. I think there were $337 a ton. I think you've been buying in January. You were buying ammonia, $285 a ton in the last couple of months have been $215. Is there something unusual as to why your ammonia costs are so high and they're coming down so slowly? I realized the volumes are a little bit light, but there's something more than that?","James O'Rourke","Yes. Thanks, Jeff. I'll give the simple answer and hand it to either Corrine or Clint too. I think what you've got to take into account there is our CF ammonia contract is as fixed volume and basically think of it as a fixed price contract probably today in that $320 range.","So as the production goes down and ammonia consumption goes down, the ratio of CF contract ammonia goes up. So actually it can dampen the price declined by quite a bit. We do expect that to go to more normal one-third, one-third, one-third where we've been, but I think last quarter we were something like 40% some of CF ammonia, which makes our cost structure a little \u2013 a little higher than it would have been on just market. Clint or Karen?","Clint Freeland","Yes. The one thing I would add to that, Jeff, and I think I alluded to it in my comments a little bit earlier. Is that one of the things that we're trying to do to improve that blended cost for ammonia is to be able to use more of our internally produced ammonia out of Louisiana.","And so one of the things that we're doing is we're making a modest investment, in a dock in the Louisiana that will allow us to transport more of that ammonia from Louisiana to Florida to use in our operations. That again, should, allow us to bring down that average cost because that is the lowest cost source that we have. And we would expect that project to be done by the end of this year. So we should start to see benefits from that in 2020.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joel Jackson.","Joel Jackson","Hi, good morning, everyone. I want to talk a little bit about the bear case or the - sort of low end of your guidance range for the year. So, if I understand you've assumed flat pricing and P&K for all on price times going on for rest of the year. And I wonder why that is the low end of the range since you know, the price trends in both those commodities to not reverse had been falling for some months.","So maybe what's different now where you're expecting prices to rebound? You speak about Chinese production discipline, but those are some statements made some weeks ago. We haven't seen anything really prevail yet. So maybe just a little commentary on what gives you conviction that now is the time for both commodities to rebound.","James O'Rourke","Well, let me give you two things unnecessarily. Prices move up, which is our expectation. First of all, your mix will change if you think about it first half the year more focused on Asia, less on U.S. for potash as an example, while potash and phosphates probably, but potash in particular, now we're going to have a big North American fall and Brazil coming into season, those are premium grades or whatever blend grade, potash would sales for a higher price in phosphates.","We've just said a 10 million new acres \u2013 our 10 million acres not planters. So we expect the farmer to really be pushing for higher acreage and that will mean higher volumes, which really drives a positive price pressure for. So we, I felt that was a reasonable level between the bear case and the bold case. And we were transparent about what the assumptions we used.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Isaacson.","Ben Isaacson","Good morning. Thank you. Two questions. First one is on your unallocated capital, which on your slide deck shows $300 million to $500 million down from$400 million pm to $500 million, down from 400- 700. And that's supposed to be weighted in the back half of the year. So here we are and maybe you can kind of run through how you're thinking about, um, using that capital. Clint or Joc among balance sheet buybacks, you've obviously doubled the dividend. Is there room for further increase there? Second question is on Plant City. Can you talk about the alternative uses that you're evaluating? What are they timing, CapEx, et cetera? Thank you. ","James O'Rourke","Well, let me answer the first ones \u2013 second one, first Ben. No, I can't really talk about the alternative uses because we are in negotiation with other parties for what we might do with that. CapEx there would not be anything for us. It would be something for somebody else. The idea would be that rather than turning down the plant, we would actually repurpose the plant and they're active negotiations there. In terms of unallocated capital, I think I'll just hand that straight over to Clint to give you a little background.","Clint Freeland","Hi, Ben. I don't think our thinking on that really has changed. I think as we look out to the balance of the year and even into 2020. I think we are going to look to, certainly continued to look at different investments we're going to take into consideration where share prices and look to be sure that we're allocating capital to the highest risk adjusted opportunities that are available.","I think our balance sheet is in a pretty good spot as we've spoken about before. So I think we can look at those other two alternatives. With that said, we have said that we want to have the cash on our balance sheet and available before we actually allocate it. So at this point, I would say that we're not there yet, but when we are there, those are the things that we would be looking at.","Operator","Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar.","PJ Juvekar","Yes. Hi. Good morning. So we've seen numbers that P&K application could be down as much as 6% this year. Do you agree with that? And how much do you think it can bounce back next year? Or could it be more than 6%? And then secondly on China DAP exports, I think they were up about 10% in the first half. Where do you see them going especially with the weaker yuan? Thank you.","James O'Rourke","Thanks PJ. Let me touch on those and then I'll hand them over to Karen again. Certainly, P&K applications were down. If it's 10 million acres, that's certainly down at least 6%, probably closer to 10% in terms of application. So we do expect a bounce back, but I guess if you took the normal 95 million acres instead of 91 or 92, that would represent about a 3% to 5% bounce back. So while there's been a loss, we expect to say half of that to come back in the spring.","In terms of China exports, we're seeing those quickly come down. I think we\u2019re about 1 million tons ahead of last year at the start and now in two months, we're down to where we're maybe 100,000 over. Anything you can add to that Karen?","Karen Swager","No, I think that's right, Joc. We started the year at those higher margin levels. They were exporting a little more aggressively. They certainly started decreasing that pace of those exports in May and we saw further reduction in the pace of those exports in June. With the weaker currency, it does help a little bit in terms of their margins, but they are still down very close to their cash, what we believe our cash costs. And so we expect that we'll see a continued decrease in the pace of those exports and we still do expect to see a lower number when the year ends from the prior year.","James O'Rourke","And recognized the weaker currency does help their cash cost slightly, but it also incense them to grow more in country, which should incent in country demand.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Piken.","Michael Piken","Hi. I wondered if you guys just provide an update, you guys mentioned that you actually lose about $15 million from ammonia. Just your thoughts as we move into 2020 and how much of that was markets conditions versus anything associated with logistics and ramp up?","James O'Rourke","Thanks, Michael. Look, I think in terms of modern, I believe the forecast this year is to be running somewhere in that 2 million to 2.5 million ton mark from modern, and those are questions better ask of them obviously than us.","But I think with that lower volume that they're making this year, their cash margins or their margins will be a little more pressured as they ramp up. But obviously, the market is the other factor, I mean, and the low ammonia price means their normal advantage in ammonia is much less than it would be under a more normalized market conditions.","Let me go back to a question from Chris Parkinson. I think we missed your rock cost question Chris. So in the interest of helping out, let me, so rock costs are \u2013 we component those between, a couple of things. We have the idling \u2013 idle costs of the South Pasture mine, which for now is down.","We've had a number of turnarounds that we've done, which have impacted the near-term rock hustles will come down. And the other thing is when we're using less, the ratio of Miski Mayo comes down or comes up and that tends to add to our overall consumed rock costs. Our 2021 targets that we set in the spring and talked about in the spring have not changed. And you'll see an improvement in those rock costs as we move into the second half of the year.","Operator, are there any more questions?","Operator","There are no more questions.","James O'Rourke","Okay. If there are no more questions, I want to conclude our call. And let me emphasize a couple of key points. First, we are executing very well. We have transformed our cost structures and operating efficiencies in each of our business units and that work is delivering meaningful benefits regardless of the markets. Mosaic today is stronger and more resilient than any time in our history.","Secondly, we're making major progress on key initiatives. Our Brazilian mines will be back and full of operations this month and our new K3 mine at Esterhazy is ramping up as expected and that has given us extremely good flexibility in our Potash business.","Finally, we expect much stronger market fundamentals to immersion as we move into 2020 and we expect Mosaic and its shareholders to benefit from our work to strengthen the Company as markets improve.","Thank you for joining our call today and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you for joining on today's call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be opened to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon, you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O'Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday, and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our fourth quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to the Form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures. ","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","Joc O'Rourke","Good morning. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. We are going to keep our prepared remarks at a high level today and allow plenty of time for your questions. Before we get into the results, I would like to take this time to welcome Tony Brausen, Interim CFO to his role. He has been helping me prepare for every earnings since I became CEO and is a valuable member of our leadership team.","Now let's move on to earnings, although we reported a GAAP net loss of $431 million, it does not reflect the strength of the underlying business. Reported results include a $458 million non-cash charge related to the new U.S. tax legislation. Going forward we expect the new legislation to provide cash benefits in excess of $200 million over the next five years. EBITDA in the quarter was 271 million up 36% from a year ago. Mosaic's enters the year with a strong quarter, and significant momentum, driven by important strategic decisions, strong operating performance and improving market conditions as we head into 2018. We would like you to take away three key messages today, first we continue to expand our record of successful strategic actions to during shareholder value across the cycle. Second, with the acquisition in Brazil now complete we are highly focused on achieving the savings target and business transformation we outlined in our last call. And third, business conditions improved markedly in 2017 and we expect momentum to continue this year. For the quarter Mosaic reported a loss of $1.23 per share, excluding tax related charges and other notable items, adjusted earnings with $0.34 per share on sales of 2.1 billion. For the year the company reported a loss of $0.31 per share with adjusted earnings net of notable item at a $1.09 per share on sales of 7.4 billion. Our solid financial performance was driven by improving market conditions but also by our cost reduction initiatives.","Last year we made important decisions to transform our business and those decisions are generating meaningful benefits. I'll review these quickly. We idled our Plant City phosphate facility in Florida demonstrating our commitment to optimizing production from our lowest cost facilities and removing 1.4 million tons of annual finished product from global supply. ","Phosphate prices rose in response and our fourth quarter gross margin rate in the business unit expanded to $53 per ton from $34 a ton a year ago. ","In addition, the phosphates business also embarked on a major transformation effort that is expected to lead to reduce costs, improved processes and further margin expansion. In the potash business where the transformation is further along, cost remained near historical lows while we produced at high rates to meet record global demand and we reduced our capital spending without compromising the safety of our people or the integrity of our assets. Taken together these costs and capital related decisions provided significant cash flow benefits and strengthened our ability to prosper. At the same time, we put capital to work to generate future returns.","We also made good progress on our major strategic initiatives, our Esterhazy K3 complex is nearing completion and we have produced the first meaningful tons of potash from the new facility. We expect Esterhazy to be amongst the lowest cost potash mines in the world as over time K3 will allow us to eliminate brine management expenses. ","Our joint venture with Ma'aden the [indiscernible] phosphate complex is ramping production providing us access to low cost production and advantage access to India and other Asian markets and of course we completed our largest acquisition ever and we did so on terms that were renegotiated to benefit Mosaic by several hundred million dollars. The newly formed Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil and Paraguay makes Mosaic America's powerhouse with advantaged access to customers in key agricultural regions. ","Our team is Brazil is off and running working to transform the business and deliver the $275 million in total synergies we revealed last quarter. We expect to achieve at least $100 million of those synergies in this year alone and that is after any cost to achieve them. In fact, we plan to exit the first quarter having already achieved $40 million of run rate synergies and we will be booking a charge associated with the cost to achieve those in this quarter. ","Overall, we have made a great deal of progress in 2017, and we are not stopping there. We will continue to drive for efficiency improvements while maximizing the value of our asset portfolio all around the world. We have also continued to focus on our financial priorities which begins with maintaining a strong financial foundation. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we issued $1.25 billion of debt to finance the cash portion of the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition.","With our stronger business performance in 2017, the 411 million in cash from operations we generated during the quarter and our improved outlook for 2018 we are already making progress towards our targeted leverage ratio of approximately two to two and a half times net debt to EBITDA. ","Under the renegotiated terms of the acquisition we transferred just over $1 billion of cash and we're also able to paydown $200 million of our outstanding term loan. During 2018 we expect to use our cash to paydown a total of at least $350 million which is halfway to our original debt retirement goal of $700 million by the end of 2020.","The overall message here is that we are on solid financial footing and we are well on our way to making Mosaic efficient and highly competitive on a global scale regardless of the business conditions. ","Before I conclude I want to provide a brief update on market conditions. Potash and phosphate prices have been low for several years in large part because of expectations of significant new capacity. Now as those new tons begin to come to market prices have moved upward due to two primary forces, first global Potash and phosphate demand has continued to grow and our market analysis team now expects another record year for global shipments of both products. Demand has been resilient due to positive and economic factors.","The second factor driving fertilizer prices higher is that new capacity has delivered fewer tons on expected. And those tons that are coming to market are being offset by higher cost production that is been idle or permanently stopped. ","Markets fundamentals were quite strong for the first half of the year and with the many actions we've taken to solidify the business we believe our performance will continue to strengthen in 2018. We have simplified our guidance to better align with our new segments and for the first time we are providing annual earnings per share guidance. We expect annual adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.50. The wide range at this early stage in the year reflects the inherent uncertainty and the timing and magnitude of changes in market prices for our products, which provides both opportunity and risk to our forecast. ","Our two primary areas of focus are first, ensuring that we continue to operate efficiently and second, capturing Mosaic for [Indiscernible] synergies. We are also watching Brazilian reais and the Canadian dollar exchange rates given the impact they have on our profitability. Our industry and our company have enjoyed an enormous amount of change over the past several years. ","At Mosaic, we took advantage of market conditions as they changed and we have made and are continuing to make structural improvements to strengthen the company for the long-term. One area that will not change, we will continue to operate responsibly with integrity and the highest degree of FX and we will maintain our commitment to our many constituents. ","Our customers who serve those needs, shareholders, employees, our communities, non-government organizations and the governments because the sustainability and prosperity of this enterprise is important to all those constituent groups. I make this point because it is easy to lose sight of the big picture and challenging time. We have a vision that transcends day to day changes in the market and we fully intend to bring that vision to provision. ","Now will take your questions. Operator? ","Question-and-Answer Session","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.","Q - Vincent Andrews ","Just wondering if you can give a little bit more detail on your expectations this year as it relate to the fertilize on date assets and I guess just in terms of what production levels you are anticipating from a wholesale perspective and as I look at the growth profit per ton that you've guided to what that incorporates for synergies and maybe you could just help us understand and I know we don\u2019t have the fourth quarter results yet in the pro formas but what you think the base is of 2017 when you strip out some of the other sort of non-GAAP or one-off issues that the company had last year. I mean how should we be thinking about that year-over-year? Thanks.","Joc O'Rourke","Well, good morning Vincent thanks for your question. So let me start by saying the expectations that we are guiding to are what we expect for the combined business of what is now Mosaic Fertilizantes which is our distribution business and our wholesale or B2B businesses we\u2019re calling at and I am going to let Rick talk a little bit about volume expectations and what not, but let me start by saying we are very excited about where this business can go, Rick and I where there last two weeks ago, touring the sites and we just see so much opportunity there that we\u2019re pretty excited. As we look at the places where we see those opportunities to add value, we believe we can drive real efficiencies across the mining processing and support functionaries the normal kind of synergy areas. ","The one we don\u2019t talk much about, you don\u2019t hear too much both those as we see huge opportunities in our go-to-market strategy as well and what we can do there, I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples here and we\u2019re also making I think really good progress towards the $275 million and including in that is we expect a $100 million of net benefits this year. So that\u2019s net of any cost to achieve them. And we\u2019ll be as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we will be actually having an allowance for that in the first quarter. ","But let me just give you a couple of good examples of where we\u2019re going with that. First of all, we see a $24 million achievement already basically booked for this core first quarter on labor, we\u2019re going to have about a $9.4 million benefit on equipment reduction and equipment optimization in the gypsum area the rethinking about gypsum strategy will net us approximately $3 million to $3.5 million per year. And one that you won\u2019t comment [ph] are synergies, our rethinking of our strategy around pricing and marketing of seed will probably net us in the range of $20 million per year starting this year. ","So, we got a lot of things on the go and I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019re going to hit our $100 million this year and our $275 million in the next. Before I give it over to Rick, I just want to remind you of one other thing which is we renegotiated this deal at the end of last year and part of that was due to the underlying, underperformance of the business in previous years. So, that allowed an into renegotiate and so the baseline is low, but we still expect very solid returns overall, overtime. ","So, let me hand it over Rick to just give you some ideas on production. Rick?","Richard Mack","Yeah. Thanks, Joc. Good morning, Vincent. from our perspective here on the distribution side, we see our distribution business growing as the market grows so the expectation is 2% to 2.5% increase in the overall volume of tons here in Brazil. So, we see us following that path, we\u2019re at a market share that we\u2019re very comfortable with on the distribution side. On the production side, I think the target for us this year is around 4 million tons of PNK production. ","Last year there were some issues with production here on the Vale Fertilizantes side and we\u2019re working to effects. Jack, the only thing that I would add to your comments about the changes that we're making and things that are going on, is we've done something here with all of our employees in engaging them to identify areas that we can save. And to be honest there is some pent-up changes that are bubbling up that really give us a lot of confidence in both the 100 number for this, the 100 million number and 275 for the future. Thanks John.","Joc O'Rourke","I think that's a great point that Ric makes, and one of the things that I was struck with like say being there a couple of weeks ago was we've been very clear with the employee [ph] base, big changes need to be made, but it seems certainly that they're very engaged and very onboard with making those changes. So, it's going very well I think.","Operator","Your next question is from Andrew Wong with RBC Capital Markets.","Andrew Wong","So, regarding the synergies for Fertilizantes is it fair to say that these are both synergies and cost savings, it sounds like these are assets that maybe haven't had the right attention, and investments required maybe were a little bit neglected and you're bringing a fresh viewpoint to drive some of these cost savings and then also have synergies with your distribution business there?","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, absolutely and I think as we clarified at last quarter we see this as approximately $125 million of what I would call traditional synergies, those are admin and what not that we just -- because we are combining the two, we'll see a lower price probably for sulfur because of our buying power, and those are traditional synergies. Above and beyond that we see about a $150 million of what I would call operational disciplines and those real cost savings that we've implemented in our -- in both our potash and phosphate businesses to-date and so that's just bringing a whole new level of operational excellence to that business.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Michael your line is open.","Michael Piken","Hello, can you talk a little bit about your MicroEssentials business a little and specifically with the [MAP] prices going higher, how your margins are standing there, and what are the volumes?","Joc O'Rourke","I am going to hand that to Corrine but I will say that our MicroEssentials business continues to perform very well, the one caveat I would give you though depending on the MicroEssentials form, because we have about four of them, the margins maybe slightly different depending on the product, but again it continues to go well, MAP prices are up, but MicroEssentials margins pretty much follow that. Corrine do you want to say a few words?","Corrine Ricard","I think it is a good point that there're multiple different products that make up the MicroEssentials line of product, they have slightly different price differentials relative to MAP, depending on the nutrients analysis and they have slightly different margins and so mix in any given quarter can have an impact on what that average differential is, but we are seeing no change in the overall market pricing of these products relative to MAP as we've seen increased prices and as we get into the peak of spring season, while we have increasing prices, throughout the season because of the optimistic outlook for the overall market?","Operator","Your next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. ","Jonas Oxgaard ","I'm trying to figure out the inclusion of the inflation [ph] distribution business into the Fertilizantes and in the context of the last four quarters you had about 170 million of gross margin in the distribution business. But if I'm looking at your pro forma I get to about 170 million from the combined entity and I'm just not sure if I'm misreading how to read the pro forma here or how should I think about the gross margin contributions from the standalone for Fertilizantes business?","Joc O'Rourke","I'm going to have to hand to Tony Brausen to talk about the basis of what we've presented here and what that means from and SG&A perspective and what not and depreciation. Tony do you want to give a little bit of a run down on that for us?","Tony Brausen","There are a number of adjustments in the pro forma information for Mosaic Fertilizantes that maybe skewing your assessment and those include the fact that we have adjusted for IFRS to U.S. GAAP, we've adjusted for our accounting policy alignment and most importantly we've adjusted for our fixed asset values that we are expecting to record those assets at so from a purchase price accounting standpoint we have to record them at a and the fair-value and we have to depreciate them based on the expected remaining useful life. ","So, at this point in time this pro forma information is preliminary because that information has done at a very high level and is not yet been finalized. We've also made adjustments to the SG&A allocation in the segments so we're now allocating a portion of our corporate SG&A to the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment and then another big change from what was previously international distribution is we've removed India and China from that segment and that's now reported incorporate and other, so what you see in the Mosaic Fertilizantes segment is just our Brazilian businesses is the combined distribution business along with the new business from probably Fertilizantes. ","And then lastly, as it relates to that pro forma information another big factor is in the phosphate segment and we're now including Miski Mayo as a fully consolidated business so previously that was an equity earnings in equity investments so it was reported just on the one line in the income statement and now that's captured with sales cost to good sold in margin in the phosphate segment and that also has along with it depreciation, so that impacts the gross margin you'll see reported in the phosphate segment. ","Joc O'Rourke","So just summarizing that I know there is a fair bit of moving pieces in this and we will improve our disclosure on the business as we get more metrics and what not so that you can really follow but just let me emphasize. This business did underperformance '17, we expect that will improve but it's going to take a little bit of time and most of what we're accomplishing in '18 is going to be the movement of prices up and our own efforts to improve the business through the 100 million of value capture, so that's probably the easiest way to put it, and certainly over the long term we are still very confident that we're going to reach the numbers we talked about.","Tony Brausen","Joc just one other factor I'll add in and that's the exchange rate for the Brazilian reais which is going to have a significant influence on the results of that segment as well and as you can see in the materials provided with this call, that's about a $0.07 per share impact, for every 0.1 movement in the Brazilian reais, so that's a meaningful factor as well.","Operator","Your next question is from John Roberts with UBS.","John Roberts","So, for the new Mosaic Fertilizante segment the volume guidance seems to imply much higher growth for the year than for the first quarter even when you adjust for the lost week in January I think, could you maybe discuss the seasonality to the volumes in that segment?","Joc O'Rourke","I am going to hand this to Rick in a couple of seconds but obviously your first point is very relevant which we did not close at the start of the quarter, so there'll be less on a full quarter in the first quarter volume, but also the first quarter is traditionally a pretty quiet quarter in Brazil, so I'm going to let Rick talk a little bit more about the actual seasonality but certainly that's your observation is correct.","Richard Mack","And John, Joc is right that Q1 is traditionally a seasonally slow quarter, there is one item that impacted this and it's based on product we had sold in the distribution side, for delivery in Q1, because farmers were getting ready to plant corn on some of their earliest harvested soybeans, they anticipated deliveries, so we had a 175,000 tonnes and up in last year that's impacting volumes in the first quarter of this year. We see that coming back to us during the year as I said we'll grow with the market, and that's what making Q1 look at little smaller than it has been in the past. It -- but from our perspective we feel really good about the quarters to come and the biggest quarter will be the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America.","Steve Byrne","So, roughly out of this 10 million tonne volume that you're forecasting for the Fertilizante segment, is it -- can you split that between what is kind of the legacy distribution business which you're -- the lower margin versus the margins in the $50 tonne range that you've in your phosphate and potash businesses and do you see that portion that is kind of legacy Fertilizantes phosphate production, could it reach the $50 a tonne range that you're forecasting for your legacy Mosaic operations and how long do you think it would take to get there?","Joc O'Rourke","Let me answer that fairly high level first of all as Rick mentioned earlier we're expecting about 4 million tonnes from the what you call the legacy Fertilizante business and then there would be about 6 million tonnes which is traditionally what we've shift out of our existing distribution business, the margin will be basically in three pieces, you're going to have -- your lowest margin will be in the what I would call the bulk commodity distribution. Our premium product margin is pretty good in terms of even in distribution we get a pretty good margin in that. ","And then the rest of the margin will be made up with the Fertilizantes aspect or the B2B business. The B2B business will have pretty reasonable margins at this point and I think the highest that will be micro central followed by B2B and then bottom will be our bulk commodities. So that\u2019s kind of the split of how it works and that adds up to as it was put in the pro forma and it really shows the split there I think quite clearly. ","Operator","Your next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna.","Donald Carson","Thank you. Question follow up on Vale, you\u2019ve said in the past that excluding your cost savings you think that through the cycle EBITDA can average $300 million. Where were we in 2017 and how do you see that given your strong phosphate market outlook for 2018. ","And then just a follow up on your Joc on your market outlook, we saw a big pickup in demand ship building and potash in calendar 2017. What gives you confidence that these were actually pounds in the ground as appose to kind of channel inventory accumulation that could steal from forward demand?","Joc O'Rourke","Okay. Don, thank you for the question. Let me start by saying, I think the pro forma aren\u2019t finished for the fourth quarter as you are well aware, but if we look at that, the EBITDA contribution from Vale Fertilizantes, I think in the first three quarters was pretty low because of low prices and the performance. So, as we look at 2017 most of the contribution if we combine them in the pro forma actually comes from our own distribution business. ","The second piece of your question, the inventory situation and where we see potash, I\u2019m going to give Mike a handover you in a second, but let me answer your question on a high level which is I believe this is actually going to the ground, we have not seen around the world, a big buildup of inventory. Mike?","Michael Rahm","Yeah, thanks Joc. And good morning Don. Yeah, we\u2019ve taken up our 2017 estimate of global shipment pretty significantly as a result of recently released statistics where at 65 million tons of MLP shipments in 2017. That\u2019s a nearly 7% increase, we think that has on, on the ground in most geographies. ","If you look at on the statistics from Brazil, they\u2019re showing that on December 31, stocks were down 8%, they\u2019re holding 1.5 months' worth of inventory relative to production, we know that in India the pipeline is very low, same thing in China with the situation in Rhea [ph] it\u2019s been a big increase in NPK production and drawdown our potash inventories at NPK plants. The one number that does jump out, I think in North America we had a very strong fall season, we had a very good response to winter fill following the $20 price increase announcement. So, there I think we will pull some demand forward, but generally we think that channel inventories around the world are in pretty good shape. And that for 2018 we are forecasting about 2.6% increase or about 1.7 million metric tonne increase in shipments again. ","Operator","Your next question is from Adam Samuelson with Goldman Sachs.","Adam Samuelson","Ah yes, thanks good morning everyone. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color on the 1-1.50 earnings per share guidance for 2018 and some of the underlying assumptions that kind of bend to the high and low end of that range in the potash, phosphate and the Fertilizantes businesses, I know you've given a volume range but any kind of calibration on kind of the pricing at the high end low end, the margin assumptions that kind of would lead us to one end or the other would be very helpful, thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks Adam. Let me hand most of that over to Tony, I think he probably has the best handle on what goes into that guidance. Tony do you want to just take that?","Tony Brausen","You bet. Adam good morning. We are not planning to give full year guidance at the margin or pricing level and as you may recall we didn't give that in the past either. What we are attempting to do by providing full year guidance in addition to the sales volume guidance is to just keep the strategic -- shift the focus to the more strategic and the long-term discussion but with that having been said let me give you a little bit of the detail in the assumptions that have gone into that guidance. ","So, starting with the diluted share count now it's higher than it used to be because of the shares issued with the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition so now that's about 386 million. You've seen in the conversation this morning that we're expecting the effect of tax rate to be in the low 20s for 2018. Interest expense of course you'd expect that to be up year over year because we issued the debt late last year, tied to the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. ","So, we expect that interest expense to be up but still under a $200 million level. The other operating expense number, we're calling that what you often see in other operating expense are the notable items that we report and the $1.00 to a $1.50 is exclusive of any notable items. ","So, you'd expect that other operating expense line in your model to be about you know what you'd typically see with no unusual items and so that would probably be in about the $40 million range. We've given SG&A guidance at 3.25 to 3.50 and of course we've given the range of ton guidance as well so hopefully that gives you some of the information you're looking for and with all of that information I think you'll be able to assess the range of gross margins from your perspective.","Operator","Your next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.","Jeff Zekauskas","Thanks very much. As far as your plant city phosphate production, do you plan to bring that up later in 2018 or in 2019 and if you don't bring it back up at all do you have to write it down and if you wrote it down what would be the magnitude of the write-down.","Joc O'Rourke","Okay, thanks Jeff. Let me say we shut down plant city or sorry we idled plant city on the basis that we would assess the impact it had on softening the blow let's say of new production coming on line. You know since we idled the plant we have seen increased margin of stripping markets stripping margins of about $40 per ton. I believe part of this is directly attributable to our own actions here. And so, we expect to see a very improved conversion cost by focusing on our lower cost plants particularly if we can run these attire rates overtime. ","So, what I would say is we will re-assess plant city in the next six to eight months and say did it really have the impact we expected, is there a market need that we really want to bring that back to satisfy or do we believe that the market will be able to meet the needs of our customers without that plant and us be able to focus on the lower cost production. So, with that I'm going to hand it over to Tony because Tony probably has a feel for the overall DD&A for that plant.","Tony Brausen","As I recall the DD&A I think it was in the 30 million neighborhoods perhaps 25 million somewhere in that range, Jeff and I don\u2019t have that fully committed to memory and you asked also about an asset write-off if we were to permanently close, yes there is certainly would be I don\u2019t have the net asset value of that operation committed to memory as well but if that's important to you we can that. But I would tell you any write-off if there were a permanent closure decision would be fully non-cash and would be reported as a notable item.","Joc O'Rourke","Well, there would be cash costs, let me highlight though is the closure cost and the actual closure of that site would need to be paid so the AR was need to be expensed at that point.","Operator","Your next question is from of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.","P.J. Juvekar ","So, China [dap] exposure was down in 2017. What's your outlook for 2018? And then last year you had expected [debt map] shut downs in China which did not materialize at least in 2017 any chance that the situation could change this year and could we see shut down in 2018? ","Joc O'Rourke","I'm going hand this is to Corrine and Mike to talk about little bit. But let me start by saying there are some real factors in China that we talked about last year and I think because of higher pricing they maybe took longer to occur so and obviously that's a risk or opportunity this year if the prices are higher China's actions may be different. But here is some of the factors I think that are real relevant at this stage. ","They definitely are running into higher environmental compliance cost which are driving cost higher. There is higher cost for some of the raw materials like ammonia again mostly driven by environmental changes and the restrictions on the use of coal, fired ammonia plants or coal gasification plants. We have environmental shutdowns that are occurring because of pollution issues and so these are becoming real issues.","And then the last one is the idea of stock piling for domestic surety in the spring market those are all real factors that are going to affect China. But what I will say is our base line assumptions for this year do not include a substantial change in Chinese export, so what we're predicting today is basically flat Chinese exports now if that changes, that is all upside to our business case, Corrine?","Corrine Ricard","Yes, I think that's a good recap Joc, of what we're seeing today, the only additional thing that I would add is that we know that the January export numbers are about half of what they were last year in January, January is a small number but we look on track for the Q1 to start to see some reduction in those exports.","Tony Brausen","And what I would P.J. is I think you've to put that in the context of what's going on in the global phosphate market, I think as we mentioned on the last call if you look at the increase in demand that we expect in 2018, which is about 1.2 million tonnes, look at the closure of Plant City which takes another 1.7 million -- or 1.5 million tonnes out of the equation, that's a whole of about 2.7 million tonnes that has to be filled with the incremental production coming from somewhere and we know that the Ma'aden Al-Shamal joint venture will ramp up, we know it produced about 450,000 tonnes last year, if it produces somewhere in that 2 million tonne, mark, there's some tonnes there, OCP is ramping up its third hub, it has announced that the fourth hub has been delayed, and if you just assume that there'll be 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes of incremental supply coming from those two sources, that basically implies that the market is balanced, so anything that happens in China with respect to reduction in supply, simply tightens the market further. ","And I guess I would go back to early comment, exports from China actually increased last year when you look at the China customs statistics. In 2016, exports were about 9.5 million tonnes and actually were 10.1 million tonnes last year according to custom statistics and basically as such the market needed those tonnes, and as Corrine points out there're real changes taking place this year, and we will admit that we jumped the gun a bit last year and called it a little bit early, but the bottom line is we think there's a very good likelihood that exports do drop this year and if that happens, that's just fuel on the fire, in terms of the S&D balance.","Operator","Your next question is from Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse.","Christopher Parkinson","Your raw thoughts and what you actually consolidate, can you comment on the key drivers drive -- have resulted in the reduction in per tonne cost, your hesitation on how this will trend in '18 and also just any quick longer-term thoughts on rock trimming and production with Miski Mayo?","Joc O'Rourke","Sorry, I missed the piece on Miski Mayo, I didn't quite catch your question Chris. Could you just re-ask that?","Christopher Parkinson","The end of the question was simply just any longer-term thoughts on rock [indiscernible] at Miski Mayo, that's all?","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, so look yes, we had pretty good rock costs in the fourth quarter and I think those are actions that the phosphate team is doing to a, increase volumes and drive the -- again the low-cost operations and long term we expect that to continue as we continue to drive our cost and really look at efficiency in all our mining. So, I think that's a pretty good indication of what we can expect and certainly in the first half of this year coming up. ","In the year, we intend to look at our rock strategy very holistically, so in other words we now have a completely different rock profile being with the idling of planned city, with the addition of the Miski Mayo tons from the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. We have an opportunity to really relook and rethink how we're going to optimize that rock and I think by doing that we will really be able to figure out what is the best option for us and that that really leads into your second question of what's going to happen with Miski Mayo. ","At this stage our goal at Miski Mayo is to drive out cost and develop efficiencies particularly now that we've consolidated that into a 2% joint venture with ourselves and [Indiscernible] so we intend to really take a hard look at what we can do there. In terms of increasing production from Miski Mayo that will have to be assessed over time. ","Operator","The next question is from Ben Isaacson with Scotiabank.","Unidentified Analyst ","What would your EPS guidance have looked like if you weren\u2019t pro forma and then maybe how are you thinking about the [Indiscernible] in the Brazilian mine going forward do you expect to meet those [Indiscernible]?","Joc O'Rourke","First of all I'm going to take your questions, the accretion and dilution question on Vale and look what we see this year is with the improvements we made and yes I've gotten through them in further details I'm not going to rehash that but I think we are pretty much on track with where we saw we would be and I actually think that probably the Vale this year will be and it's hard to give an exact number but will be close to accretive this year or slightly accretive but it's going to be in that range of fairly neutral on the 34 million extra shares. ","Sorry I missed getting your second question there. I was just making sure I have that question correct. Your question on our Brazil Potash mine now the Brazil Potash mine has a very local issue and so it really depends on how well it can deliver efficiently to a local market and at this stage it appears to be a quite competitive in that local market so I would say it has a very good chance with some improvements if that could be a good contributor. ","In terms of your other cost or your other question as we ramp-up K3 we will continue to look at how do we serve our customers from the most efficient way possible now so that's going to depend on volume requirements it's going to depend on pricing and everything else but we can assure you that we continuously look at each of our assets and say are they adding the real kind of value that we believe they should and are we doing the best for our customers in terms of optimization and we will continue that.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.","Unidentified Analyst ","At your Investor Day you presented us the ramp over the next couple of years. I was curious is your goal [Technical Difficulty] or are there other reasons or other work you are doing that makes that ramp more measured than it could be if the we're actually there to push more tonnes?","Joc O'Rourke","Look certainly let me first of all tell you the challenge if you will of developing a new mine, we get to the bottom of K3 which we did in February and you have basically what amounts to a 6 meter or 20 foot hole you have to develop out from that, that takes years, not months to get that done, at this stage we are dropping in our first raw miners now to underground, so we're starting to ramp up the rate at which we can develop and build out that mine, but we're doing it about as fast as we can, what will happen though is depending on the market whether we do -- we focus more on development or whether we focus more on bringing out tonnes, really depends a little bit on the market and then obviously the tradeoff being the ongoing costs of the K2 brine inflow but this is why new tonnes are not coming in as fast to market. ","Operator","Your final question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Vincent your line is open. And there is no response from Vincent.","Joc O'Rourke","Okay with that let me close off by a quick summary, we really finished the year with a strong quarter and significant momentum, this was driven not only by the market but important strategic decisions we made, strong operating performance, and so as we head into 2018, it's hard not to be optimistic about where we're going, but just let me summarize we continue to expand on our record of successful strategic actions to deliver real shareholder value across the cycle; with the acquisition in Brazil complete, we're now highly focused on achieving the savings targets and the business transformation we talked about and have outlined. ","And finally, with business conditions improving from 2017 we expect this momentum to continue into this year. So, with that we're really excited about where this company is going in the next six to 12 months and we hope you are as well. Thank you very much for your attention.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today's call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President, Investor Relations of The Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon you may begin.","Laura Gagnon","Thank you, and welcome to our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. Presenting today will be Joc O\u2019Rourke, President and Chief Executive Officer; Clint Freeland, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Rick McLellan, Senior Vice President Commercial. We also have other members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions after our prepared remarks. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call. The statements include, but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on management's beliefs and expectations as of today's date and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.","We will also be presenting certain non-GAAP financial measures. Our fourth quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday's Form 8-K filing also contain important information on these non-GAAP measures.","Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Joc.","Joc O'Rourke","Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you're well aware, 2019 was a challenging year in our industry and for Mosaic, as poor weather in North America for three consecutive fertilizer application seasons left finished product inventories high and prices low, especially phosphates. Our realized DAP price declined 20% in 2019 and while potash prices remained relatively stable for most of the year, sales volumes were off over 10% as market demand weakened. Despite these market dynamics, we at Mosaic continued to focus on execution within our business and actively managing our portfolio of assets to effectively navigate this period of short-term weakness and position Mosaic for long-term success.","Now with constructive agricultural commodity prices and nutrient depleted soils across most of the U.S. corn belt growers have strong incentive to plant maximum acres and maximize their yields. We expect that U.S. farmers will plant 10 million to 15 million more acres than last year and we expect very strong fertilizer consumption and demand this spring in North America. And we are not alone.","A few weeks ago, we held our biggest customer event and it gave our entire executive team three days to engage with our top global customers. The atmosphere was upbeat. Ag retailers are feeling much better as we head into 2020. This sentiment shift, producer curtailments and a late fall surge of applications has driven phosphate prices higher. Today, we are seeing more than $65 per tonne improvement from the lowest prices traded we made in December.","Add to that, the extended production downtime in China due to the coronavirus and we see a much more constructive global supply and demand picture for the global phosphate market. This demand has depleted our inventories and will lead us to bring phosphate production back to full levels before the end of the first quarter. The potash market is waiting for a China contract to form a new price benchmark and the country's necessary response to the coronavirus outbreak has made the timing of that settlement more uncertain.","We do expect good demand in North America, Brazil and Southeast Asia, as farm economics are driving strong demand for potash around the world. So we may see a divergence from the China contract as the benchmark. We will continue to monitor the dynamics in China as they develop. While we cannot control weather or viruses and how the market reacts to those types of events, our focus continues to be on running our operations well and advancing our strategic initiatives.","In 2019, we made significant progress in managing and transforming each of our business units. In potash, we demonstrated that we could exceed major development milestones allowing us to accelerate the development of our K3 mine at Esterhazy, Saskatchewan. We increased the pace of capital allocated to this mega project to match the execution pace, so that we could eliminate brine management costs at K1 and K2, a full 2.5 years earlier than originally planned. These cost savings combined with lower cost of production should result in a total cash savings of approximately $300 million.","The ramp-up of K3 production facilitated the extended idling of the Colonsay mine. We expect to be able to meet market demand with our currently operating potash facilities and we've retained substantial surge capacity if the pace of demand growth accelerates.","Our Mosaic Fertilizantes business in South America has made tremendous strides since we completed the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition two years ago. We've now achieved approximately $330 million in annual net synergies well above our original target and we've committed to achieve an additional $200 million in annual EBITDA benefit by the end of 2022.","We also responded to the difficult situation of changing tailings down regulations with an aggressive and transparent approach. While meeting the new standards resulted in $80 million in cost and significant downtime at three of our Brazilian facilities in 2019, we were able to reach a successful resolution with all operating down certified by third parties and return to full production.","In phosphates, we demonstrated market and cost discipline. First by permanently closing the Plant City facility and then through curtailments at other phosphate manufacturing plants as markets weakened. The reduction in supply is now beginning to bring the global supply and demand picture into balance.","We are also executing a number of very exciting and promising initiatives to drive significant future efficiency gains. Those of you who joined us for our Analyst Day last March may recall that we discussed potential technological improvements at our mines. That potential is beginning to come to fruition and we are moving towards automating many elements of our mining processes in both phosphates and potash.","We expect the relative modest capital requirements to yield strong ROI in the near future and enable safe and reliable production for many years to come. We pushed the organization on many fronts in 2019 and we accomplished a great deal while affirming our commitments to responsible operations. In fact, we generated record safety performance for the seventh consecutive year and our recordable injury frequency rate is industry-leading.","We believe the broad spectrum of ESG performance provides good measures of risk management and management effectiveness and we are delivering strong results. Taken together, the moves we made in 2019 has strengthened Mosaic, permanently reduced our costs and help balance global potash and phosphate supply and demand.","Now I will turn the call over to Clint to discuss the financial details and changes in our approach to setting forward-looking expectations. After that I've asked Rick to provide some insight into the coronavirus impact in China, before I close with our updated strategic priorities. Clint?","Clint Freeland","Thank you, Joc, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, Mosaic's reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $921 million or $2.43 per share, which included $1.1 billion in previously announced non-cash charges related to asset and goodwill write-offs. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $202 million and adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.29.","For the full year, Mosaic's net loss totaled $1.1 billion including approximately $1.5 billion in non-cash charges related to the Plant City closure and the impairment of goodwill at the phosphates business unit. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.16.","At our potash business, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $159 million, down from $270 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower sales volumes and a higher rate of fixed cost absorption as we adjusted production levels to more closely align with customer demand.","With reduced demand during the fall application season, we curtailed production at our Colonsay facility leading to an overall operating rate for the segment of 63%, down from 99% in the fourth quarter of 2018. While this would normally lead to a sequential increase in production cost per tonne given the fixed cost intensity of that business, cash cost of production during the fourth quarter actually declined compared to the third quarter of 2019 as the company began to realize the benefits associated with shifting production from Colonsay to the lower cost Esterhazy K3 facility.","Additionally, gross margins benefited from a true-up of Canadian resource taxes of $13.8 million or $9 a tonne from extending the Colonsay idling. At the phosphates business, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $8 million compared to $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a significantly lower finished goods prices more than offset an improvement in raw material costs.","Despite market headwinds, which continued through the quarter, the company continued to focus on managing cost and for the period recorded a sequential decline in cash conversion cost to $64 per tonne and a $2 per tonne reduction in cash rock costs.","Adjusted EBITDA at Mosaic Fertilizantes totaled $78 million during the fourth quarter compared to $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as lower finished goods prices, distribution margin pressure and higher idle costs, more than offset benefits from raw material costs and foreign exchange rates as well as transformational gains.","As noted on the slide though, the segment's operating rate improved reflecting the final resolution of the tailings dam remediation and helping to drive cash conversion cost back to levels we saw before operations were slowed by the mine closures.","At this point, I'd like to turn to 2020 expectations. And as you may recall, I noted on our third quarter conference call that we were considering changes to our approach on earnings guidance.","The reason for this is that the primary driver behind Mosaic's earnings is the market price of finished phosphate and potash products, which is something we don't control and which can change quickly and meaningfully both positively as they did in 2018 or negatively as they did in 2019.","Additionally, we're mindful that any direct or implied pricing outlook we provide can and likely will influence customer behavior. As such, we're modifying our approach to give investors the information and tools we believe they need to accurately model the company and to make reasonable adjustments throughout the year as markets change.","As shown on slide 7, our approach pivots of actual reported adjusted EBITDA results, $1.35 billion for full year 2019 in this case. We will also note those non-market related items that will be different going forward.","In this case the $225 million that we've previously disclosed related to cost incurred in 2019 that will not reoccur in 2020 or known structural benefits from actions taken by the company.","Further detail on the makeup of that $225 million can be found in the appendix of this presentation. The total of these two items $1.575 billion in this case, should be the starting point for an investor's 2020 analysis.","As you can see we've provided annualized adjusted EBITDA sensitivities for both realized FOB mine fertilizer prices and foreign currencies, which can be applied by investors to adjust their estimates for full year consolidated results. Going forward, I would not expect to update these numbers unless there is a material change to the non market-related items.","For full year volumes, we've provided a summary of the history of each segment on slide 8. Like prices, volumes are driven by market conditions. So, consistent with our approach on market prices, we will not be providing forward guidance on volumes. But this is an important assumption that investors should update in their evaluation of the company.","One thing to note for 2020 is that we do not expect the previously disclosed curtailments in the phosphate and potash businesses to limit sales volumes in 2020 as the ramp-up of K3 replaces lost production from Colonsay and Bartow has already begun to restart production.","As reflected on slide 9, we will continue to provide the company's outlook for capital expenditures and those items needed to help investors reconcile from adjusted EBITDA to EPS.","This is the same information we've provided in the past including our expectations for DD&A, net interest expense, non notable adjustments like equity compensation and ARO accretion, and an estimated effective tax rate.","As you will note Mosaic's sustaining CapEx level for 2020 is somewhat elevated compared to historic norms, primarily due to approximately $75 million in record spend related to the phosphate segments consent decree. All work under that agreement must be final this year, so this will not be a recurring cost moving forward.","Growth CapEx for the year is focused on the K3 project at Esterhazy, and represents approximately $300 million of this total. Most of the balance is associated with previously disclosed phosphate mine extension efforts in Florida and investments in Brazil related to the next-generation transformation work at Mosaic Fertilizantes, which is expected to generate $200 million per year in recurring EBITDA benefits by the end of 2022.","And finally, to assist investors in refining their modeling of the company, we will be supplementing our traditional disclosures with two new sets of data. First, we will add new disclosures to our quarterly performance data on a number of topics. Most importantly, detail around realized pricing, product and geographic mix and raw material mix and realized costs.","Second, while our updated outlook approach is focused on annual results, we recognize the importance of modeling quarterly earnings so to that end, we will begin disclosing monthly sales volumes and revenues by business unit for the first two months of each quarter. This information will be provided in the middle of the following month on Mosaic's investor website with results for the third month of each quarter provided in the regular quarterly earnings release.","We believe this will enable investors to more effectively model quarterly results and better understand both the seasonality of our business and the lag that typically occurs between visible changes in benchmark prices and actual product pricing realized by the company.","And finally, to assist investors with more detailed modeling of Mosaic, particularly those who have less history with the company, we'll be providing an investor education deck on our investor website that will provide additional detail on the most important factors and dynamics that should be included in an analysis of the company.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick to share insight on the coronavirus.","Rick McLellan","Thank you, Clint and good morning. On behalf of all Mosaic employees, I'd like to say our thoughts continue to be with our China employees and the people in China as they manage not only the direct impacts of the coronavirus, but also the challenges they are facing with restricted movements, supply shortages and the uncertainty of when normal daily operations will resume.","Since keeping farmers healthy is critical to protecting China's food supply, we are in the process of procuring face mask to distribute to rural farmers through our local operations and business partners. These small efforts are greatly needed in the region and we hope this assists in stemming the spread of the virus.","Beyond the imminent humanitarian issues, we know there will be impact in China's supply and demand for both phosphates and potash. Approximately 30% of Chinese phosphate rock, 30% of China's DAP, and 45% of China's MAP are produced in Hubei province, which is the epicenter of this outbreak and has been subject to the most restricted rules enacted to reduce the spread of the virus.","In Hubei, phosphate production facilities have been on extended shutdowns and we understand the second round of shutdowns has been enacted from February 16 through the 29th. We believe the earliest these plants could reopen would be sometime in the first week of March.","Plants that had already resumed operations outside of Hubei province are now running short of raw materials causing some of them to reduce production. We believe the overall phosphate production shortfall will ultimately be two million tonnes in the first half of 2020.","Based upon surveys our China team conducted, half of the NPK and blend plant operators surveyed stated they have about two weeks of raw material on hand once they return to operations. This is a very low level.","If phosphate prices are attractive we do expect China to be able to ramp up to recover a portion in the back half of 2020. For potash transportation issues have hampered movement of product away from the ports and will impact ongoing contract discussions. However, spring is near and the government is working proactively to ensure the return of logistics support for agricultural products. When workers are able to safely return to duty in the plants and in transportation, the resumption of normal operations is expected to be slow. But once trucks return to the road, we expect potash will move from the port to the blenders and on to farmers, creating a need for additional potash imports during the second quarter. We continue to monitor the situation and how best we can position Mosaic in these markets and expect to provide an update later in March.","I'll now turn the call back over to Joc to share our updated strategic priorities.","Joc O'Rourke","Thank you, Rick. The short-term challenges we faced in 2019 are largely behind us and our focus is on the future. We have a clear strategic road map to grow and strengthen the company and we have the right teams in place to execute the strategy. Our goals have not changed to drive increased efficiency and competitiveness in our existing business and grow value for the long-term.","The enterprise is aligned around six strategic priorities that will build on our current strong foundation and drive a step change in performance. First in North America we'll continue to transform our potash and phosphate businesses and pursue new opportunities to improve their profitability and competitiveness. Technology and innovation will be used to accelerate our progress and drive value beyond the transformative efforts currently underway such as Esterhazy K3 and next-generation mining in phosphates.","Second, we plan to fully leverage our manufacturing and distribution advantage in Brazil, which is the fastest-growing agricultural market in the world to increase market share and profitability.","Third, we will continue to grow and strengthen the value of our product portfolio by building on the success of performance products and by pursuing strategic opportunities within the broader soil health space.","Fourth, we will leverage the learnings from our very successful Brazil integration to drive improved collaboration and efficiency in our corporate functions as well.","Fifth is our approach to capital and asset optimization. We will continue to balance our allocation between strengthening the balance sheet growing the business and returning money to shareholders. And finally, we remain committed to operating responsibly and ethically in all that we do.","So we're excited about the path before us. Markets are improving and we expect strong global demand for phosphates and potash this year and in the years ahead. We have made tremendous progress. We are managing capital effectively maintaining our market discipline and taking actions to permanently reduce our cost base, while growing long-term value.","In this increasingly unpredictable environment new seed and other technologies and effective soil nutrition are necessary for the world farmers to meet the ever-growing need for food. At Mosaic, we are managing for long-term prosperity so that we can fulfill our mission to help the world grow the food it needs.","We expect to achieve the promise of our mission by building and sustaining the most competitive, resilient, profitable and responsible company in our space. We have the right strategic plans in place to accelerate our progress on that path. And we believe Mosaic is very well positioned to add strong value for all of our stakeholders in 2020 and beyond.","Now, we will take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens Incorporated. Your line is now open.","Mark Connelly","Thank you, Joc. You covered a lot of ground, but you didn't mention Ma'aden. Can you talk about how that business is performing and how it's responding to the stress of this market?","Joc O'Rourke","Yeah. Thanks Mark. Yeah, good morning. Ma'aden's performance so far I guess this is a mega project close to $8 billion of spend. It is ramping up and continues to ramp up. While I think the final answers to that should be with the Ma'aden company to answer how they feel about the ramp-up.","From our perspective, it's ramping up about as we expected. I think they'll add another 0.5 million tonnes this year of production. So by the end of this year we'll be close to -- on track with that project for final production levels. And we still expect similar price impact benefits to Mosaic as that project completes. It will be a low-cost producer. It gives us diversity of supply particularly into markets like India and Asia. So we still think it's a great project. It was ultimately a needed project in global S&D. So -- and that's about where it stands today. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open; you may ask your question.","Jonas Oxgaard","Thank you. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on K3. You say you're going to move about 600,000 tonnes in 2020 to production there. But could you I guess give us a fuller picture of where are you? How much -- at the end of next year how much production will there be in K3? And how should we think about the capital spend going forward?","Joc O'Rourke","Yes. Thanks Jonas. K3 as we've stated a number of times, we've actually accelerated that project a couple of times now. And with that comes an acceleration obviously of the capital. The capital spend over the next couple of years I believe is in the $300 million range per year, but then ramps down quickly after 2021.","In terms of where the project is at we have completed the first shaft it is running. We have completed the conveyor over to K2 already. It is running and in production that's where the 600,000 tonnes has been moved -- of product has been moved.","We are ramping up very quickly. We're ramping up a single new minor every three or four months. And we'll soon have a conveyor over to K1 and then the second shaft running. So, we'll be at full capacity in a little over two years and that will completely complete that project.","Jonas Oxgaard","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open; you may ask your question.","Christopher Parkinson","Great. Thank you. So, lower sulfur prices declined yet kind of where the theme across the entire global phosphate cost curve in 2019 which had varying effects across the quartiles depending on timing.","Just given your own assessment of the global -- your global cost position and the fact that you had to cycle through some higher price inventory even into the second half to the events in North America. Can you just simply give us an update right here right now given your outlook for sulfur in 2020? Just what type of benefit that -- should this actually mean for strip margins and how should we be thinking about this? Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Okay Chris. I think the easiest way to answer that is obviously sulfur prices have been coming down quite a bit lately. Obviously, the difference between solid sulfur prices and the liquid molten sulfur prices makes the difference. As we go forward we're looking as low as in the mid-60s for sulfur price into the first quarter.","I don't see any reason with a lot of sulfur inventory and IMO 2020, et cetera. There's really no strong reason for that sulfur market to tighten. And if we look at inventories around the world, for example, China with three million tonnes of inventory sitting on the ground there's plenty of sulfur in place for the near term needs. So, I would expect continued weakness in sulfur pricing which as you alluded to is positive for our stripping margins.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Your line is now open; you may ask your question.","Ben Isaacson","Thank you. On page 23 of your deck you show that 2020 shipment changes could increase from zero to 2.5 million tonnes. Can you talk about the changes you see on the supply side that will contribute to your comment of a tightening market in phosphate?","So, I think you mentioned a few you've talked about I think 2 million tonnes down in China that could come back a little bit in the second half. You've talked about 0.5 million tonnes out of Ma'aden. What are the other changes that you see on the supply side that will contribute to a tightening market?","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks Ben. Let me hit a couple of these and maybe Rick McLellan might add some color to it. As we see the market on a macro scale as Rick mentioned in his remarks, the first piece is China will certainly be down. I mean Hubei province has been down. So, China's capacity will be down.","We also expect that they will focus that production that they do make in the first quarter certainly on internal or domestic requirements and then they'll make up some of that in the second half. And we expect that some of that will come back and that it is needed for global supply and demand balance.","In terms of new supply, as I said, we have new supply from Ma'aden as it ramps up. OCP has pushed back their new phos asset capacity until the second half of the year. But ultimately this year, we expect they will be also bringing on new capacity per our expectations. So we expect in that case that we will have a relatively balanced market without any changes from China. But the strong growth demand will take up all of that and then some which will need from like I say China in the second half.","Rick McLellan","Joc, I think, the only thing that I would add is that on the demand side, we see two real clear pushes for increased demand. One is in North America where we're going to have 10 million to 15 million acres of production brought back in compared to 2019. And that in turn will improve demand in North America.","And the second is in Brazil and South America where grain prices and the currency are pointing farmers towards a big second crop corn. There's challenges with weather as there always is. But the farmers are following the economics. And we've seen some of the Q4 demand that was sitting still in Brazil now get pulled into Q1. So it bodes well on the demand side.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. You ask your question.","Adam Samuelson","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping to maybe dig a little bit more into the phosphates demand side this year. Two parts. One maybe this is for Rick. Any view at this point kind of how much if any phosphate and I guess potash demand in China could be impacted by the supply disruptions and logistics disruptions in the first half of the year? I mean is there a risk of demand loss?","And then second on the North America point you alluded to strong uptake and depletion of your own inventories in recent months in response to low prices is there any concern that you've seen distributors resell at low prices and pull forward demand from the spring? Thank you. ","Joc O\u2019Rourke","Okay. Thanks, Adam. I will hand this over to Rick right away, but let me make a comment on the Chinese situation because I think the Chinese government is going to be highly focused on making sure this -- that they can have a good planting for their own needs and to make sure that food accessibility and food security is correct.","But there is a real risk here that with the idling of plants and the curtailment of transport that they're going to have a tough time getting all the product to the farm that they need to get. So we do see a risk in this but there will be some demand disruption at least in the first half of the year because of the big impact of this virus.","Rick McLellan","And I'll just take it from there Joc. Good morning, Adam. As we look at China demand I think Joc hit it in that there will be disruptions in planting and usage. But the Chinese government and again this morning in China they repeated a mandate on the importance of prioritizing movement of fertilizers and agricultural products to the blenders and on through to the distributors. So they're going to do everything possible to make sure that what gets produced gets moved to the farmer. And if somebody has a view of just what the impact of all that they've got a better view insight than we do. And we believe we have a very strong view.","The second is North American dealers and distributors have stepped into the market in a nice way in the last kind of two months almost. And it covered up the things that the volumes that they needed to just effectively take care of Q4 and get ready for the spring season. And it's a good time for us to kind of explain why we brought back up Bartow.","If we look at what's in the distributor inventories, they're about normal for this time of year. When we look back to our own facilities, we were getting empty. There's a bit of an axiom that you can't sell of an empty production warehouse, so we had to bring the plants back up, it's that simple.","And we've seen prices continue to strengthen during this period and we're seeing prices in Brazil for MAP in the $335 to $340 range and we believe there's opportunities for that to strengthen and we've seen a big push in North America, despite some wobbliness as imports come in.","We're selling 285 barges at NOLA. And if you take a look at Brazil prices it would equate to something near 300 for NOLA. So all indications right now, we've continued to have -- we're going to continue to have to move product into the marketplace to assure we meet the spring demand.","Joc O'Rourke","And let me just add a clarifier there, Rick. Potash was really following almost exactly the same process. And in China, the movement will be from the ports to the blenders and then to the farm. So both those commodities will be moving much the same way. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open. You may ask your questions.","Steve Byrne","Yes. Thank you. In your appendix you have a couple of charts that show your estimates of shipments of P&K by region, it's very useful. But if I try to eyeball the numbers in, say, North American shipments, particularly for phosphate, the decline in 2019 seems relatively modest compared to what I would have thought given the level of weather-driven disruption in demand.","Can you comment on what portion of those shipments were from you versus imports is that -- has that changed versus historical ratios? And would that level of decline be commensurate with the level of price decline that you saw in 2019? And if not, what do you think was driving that level of price decline and your outlook for an inflection?","Joc O'Rourke","Okay. Thanks, Steve. Let me try and touch on that and then hand it to Rick for a little bit extra. Yes, the 9.4, remember that is a number that is shipments, not necessarily what went to the ground. So we've talked a bunch about how much the inventory buildup was and how much the inventory buildup was, not only in our customers' warehouses, but along the river and throughout the system.","As, I think, was mentioned in the prepared remarks, the long tail of the fall application season has largely drawn down a lot of that inventory now. And so, while it shows a shipment number that is closer to a normal, the actual application number was much lower. And, of course, that's exactly what led to the price declines. And were we disproportionately hit? Absolutely. Mosaic was disproportionately hit, because the imports came in irrespective of the market conditions and the inventory build. Rick, anything to add?","Rick McLellan","Sorry. Yes, Steve. Good morning. I think, that Joc has hit the majority of it. I think your question is, what drove the pricing to where it was. I think the weather conditions, as we've kind of talked about, drove pricing to where it was and excess of imports coming to the U.S. Gulf compared to what the demand was at the farm level, that displacement of time really put the pressure on pricing at the Gulf.","And so, as you look for demand increases for 2020, as we've got in the model for North America, I think one of the things you have to take a look at is the ratio of P&K to the commodity prices. If farmers follow money and where phosphate and potash prices are today, will certainly lend itself to increased farmer applications, on a per acre basis. And that's the only other point, I'd add to what you said, Joc.","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open. You may ask your question.","Don Carson","Yes. A question on, some of the new data that you're presenting, on realizations on the phosphate page, you've got prices FOB mine. So you're $266 million, in the fourth quarter.","Is that going to -- how long before this recent price increase, we've seen will translate into higher realizations for you? And also the $266 million was well below some of the benchmarks was that due to some of the index pricing that was resulted from all these imports coming in?","So again, just kind of the timing of price realizations, in the market today when you get them? And what your outlook would be, for first and second quarter price moves?","Joc O'Rourke","Sure. Thanks, Don. I'm going to hand that straight to Rick. I think we've had -- actually had some sales recently in Brazil that would significantly push that price. And as we realize those Rick, you've got a better handle on that.","Rick McLellan","Yeah. I think, the timing Don, you hit a couple of key points. One is the index pricing model coming into North America or into NOLA that exacerbated the situation that we're dealing with.","We think that, the sellers into NOLA or have learned a fair bit. And there isn't going to be -- or that there should not be the amount of index pricing. And in fact, indexing into a market that's strengthening like, we're seeing today probably works to -- works more to the producer advantage than it does to the buyer.","And so from that perspective, and so that you talked about pricing, we believe that as we move forward into the second quarter, that you're looking at least center of gulf for noble pricing, in the $300 a tonne range with some opportunities to move from there. And we're looking for the Brazil price. Right now we've sold some 315s into Brazil for MAP or 335 what I should say. And we're looking for the 340s and there are opportunities to move from there. Clint, do you want to add?","Clint Freeland","Yeah. And Don, this is, Clint. I'll maybe add a couple of things, here. Because I think part of your question was about kind of, when do we expect to begin realizing, the change in pricing.","And I think that what you're touching on is something that's really important for investors to consider, when they're modeling our company. And that is the lag between, when you see liquid benchmark prices move versus when you actually see it in our financial statements.","And as I mentioned, in the prepared remarks, we'll be putting out a kind of an investor education deck. And that is one of the topics that will be addressed is how people should think about the lag and realizing prices and not only on the revenue side, but also on the raw material cost.","I mean in general, kind of a rule of thumb is there's typically call it a 2-month lag between when you see prices move. And when you actually see it, show up in our financial statements.","And then one other thing that may assist people, on this front, just to monitor that lag and to see things as they realize are some of our monthly disclosures that we've talked about putting out going forward, around not only volumes, but also realize revenues on a monthly basis. So again, that will be another data point that people can reference to, to calibrate that lag.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Jeremy Rosenberg","Hey good morning guys. This is Jeremy Rosenberg on for Vincent. Just a question on potash, obviously, a lot of capacity was taken off-line this year. You indicated comp is going to remain off-line.","Just wondering your thoughts on kind of the other players, if there's risk that they all bring back their capacity this year that they curtailed? And just considering, the Greenfield tonnage we're expecting from EuroChem this year, can the market support all of those tonnes this year? Thanks.","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks, Jeremy. Yeah, look, we do expect some of that tonnage to come back. I think each company who curtailed in the fall will look at the demand expectations they have for the spring going forward and make sure that they have sufficient product for the needs.","On the basis that the demand recovery will be in the range, we believe in the range of 2.9 million tonnes even with the ramp-up of the other operations we still expect there to be some deficit that which will have to come from the existing players bringing back new production.","In terms of our decision for Colonsay, I'd just like to give you a little color on that. The way we're looking at that is the combination of inventory and capacity ramp-up at Esterhazy which has been as we've talked about significantly better than what we originally planned some 8 years ago has allowed us to meet what we believe is market needs without the Colonsay operation for the near term.","We leave that in -- what I would call standby condition, so that if the markets do improve more than what we are expecting then we would be able to bring that up at some point in the future.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi.","Kendall Marthaler","This is Kendall Marthaler on for PJ. Just kind of linking back to an earlier question around sulfur, with phosphate raw material prices coming down one of your competitors had recently said that, that could be a price headwind this year. So how do you think about that impact in the broader context of all the phosphate supply-demand factors, we've been talking about on the call for 2020?","Joc O'Rourke","Thanks Kendall. Look the way I would suggest, we look at it and I would suggest you would look at sulfur pricing is, in a weak market it is hard to have the consumer absorb the price of the raw material changes. In a stronger market, we often expect that the raw materials are basically a flow through.","So what I would -- what we look at is what we would call the stripping margin which is really, what is the margin without the raw materials in it. And so in that way, yes it may -- the price may come down if the sulfur price goes down, but our profitability will not change.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Andrew Wong from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Andrew Wong","Hi, good morning. Thanks. So Joc in your prepared remarks you mentioned that global potash prices might diverge a little bit from China. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And does this indicate maybe a higher degree of uncertainty around the timing of a contract settlement this year? Thank you.","Joc O'Rourke","Yes, Andrew thanks for the question. I will talk about this a little bit. I think it's worthy of Rick mentioned -- talking a little bit on this as well. But let me start by saying, the coronavirus has created a situation. I mean if you think about the travel restrictions to China mean, it is impossible for sales teams and marketing teams to even go to China to have discussions.","So those discussions, while they're probably going on are going on by phone. As such there is added uncertainty as to when a China contract might be signed. As such the needs in the rest of the world will continue whether that be South America for their second crop for North America, for Indonesia, Malaysia all those areas are going to need potash soon. And so if there isn't an India -- sorry there isn't a Chinese contract there may have to be a different process for this year. Rick do you want to talk about that a little more?","Rick McLellan","Yes Joc. Good morning, Andrew. I think as we look at this, the China contract is going to be driven by how fast those port inventories can be drawn down because there's no more inventory -- saleable inventory being sent to China. So we're below 2.5 million tonnes. We see that being drawn down probably accelerating as this direction from the government to move inventory into position to the blenders and on to the farmers was reinforced this morning. So, we think that has an impact.","The other market that doesn't get talked about that is really, really important and saw some significant decreases in 2019 is the Malaysia and Indonesia market. And frankly, palm oil prices have jumped up quite considerably.","They've corrected recently, but the returns are there for palm oil producers, and we see a significant demand growth there. It's one that we don't talk about enough and maybe gets lost in the noise of Brazil, China and North America, but it's a significant market and we will provide significant opportunities for growth in 2020.","Joc O'Rourke","And just let me add too. If we look back to last year, India settled in the spring without the Chinese and then again in the fall without the Chinese. So, it doesn't say that the Chinese isn't an important benchmark market, but it does say that the other needs will at some point take precedent and they will have to deal with their own needs in their own countries.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open. Again John Roberts, your line is now open. You may ask your question.","John Roberts","Excuse me, can you hear me now?","Joc O'Rourke","Yeah, we can hear you.","John Roberts","Yeah. In that investor education deck that you're planning, could we get a sample of what a monthly update would look like say, what you would have reported in mid-December for the fourth quarter?","Joc O'Rourke","Clint, yeah, go ahead.","Clint Freeland","Yeah. Hi, John, it's Clint. No, I think that certainly is something that we can include in there for investors reference.","John Roberts","Okay. And then maybe you could refresh us on the earn-out that Vale had on the Fertilizantes business. Obviously the performance in the recent quarters has been much lower than expected.","Joc O'Rourke","Yeah. The simplest answer there is it wasn't actually based on business performance. The business performance has been probably better than what we expected. It was based on currency and DAP and MAP pricing. So, the payout is now complete. The payout will be zero.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Michael Piken. Your line is now open.","Michael Piken","Yeah. Hi. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about kind of your longer-term strategic plans for your Florida mines. And specifically, I know you've talked about lowering your rock cost, conversion costs. I mean if you could walk us a little bit through the cadence? I know you had showed a slide there showing that prices could be down maybe $2 by the end of 2021 on rock. But maybe you could just walk us through maybe like a five-year outlook and what the trajectory might look like? And how you see the long-term competitiveness of your Florida operations?","Joc O'Rourke","Yeah. Thanks Michael. Yeah I think that's an important question. As we sit at the very bottom of the market that becomes a question obviously. If we look going forward, if you go back our 2021 target has been -- 2021 target that we talked about at Investors Day, has been to hold our cash cost of mined rock flat over the time frame. So basically, I think the number we came to you with was about $39 per tonne.","Likewise, our cash conversion cost as we go through some of these transformations, we expect to go down into the mid-50s to high-50s. So, long-term, we \u2013 with our transformation efforts can really drive significant cost out of our system compared. And if we look at our \u2013 basically our rock plus conversion cost, we believe we're in the best quartile position. And certainly, overall where we believe we're firmly in the bottom half of the cost curve and probably in the bottom third of the cost curve. As such, through market, this is a pretty attractive business and we intend to continue to improve that business to make it even better.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.","Bria Murphy","Hi. This is Bria Murphy on for Joel. Thanks for taking my question. Firstly thanks for the sensitivity information that you provided, it's very helpful. For the phosphate segment, if phosphate prices in 2020 average the same as 2019 levels, would EBITDA be $20 million higher because of the Plant City cost savings, or how would you expect phosphate segment EBITDA to trend in a flat pricing environment even directionally?","Joc O'Rourke","I'm going to hand that to Clint to give that. I think that's part of our guidance approach.","Clint Freeland","Yes. No it isn't. Good morning. I think that would be kind of the starting point would be the $20 million that we spend on idle costs at Plant City last year, obviously that will not affect us this year. So you would see an improvement there. And then I guess the other things that you would need to factor in not only finished goods prices but also update raw materials, also update volume expectations and then overall cost targets.","So to the extent that you would adjust any of the volume targets as far as sales. Also think about what that does to cost per tonne, also think about what that does to idle costs relative to this year. So I would say that those are just a number of things to keep in mind as you model that business.","Joc O'Rourke","Yes. Let me just add one thing before we head off because I think we're running out of time very quickly, which is, look, this year we also absorbed a bunch of costs through idling our plants, we don't expect that to repeat itself. So when you look at our cost you will expect them to be more in line with long-term improvements because we have made underlying improvements.","So let me summarize before we go here. Markets are improving and we expect the global demand for both phosphates and potash this year to increase and be strong. And also we expect that to continue into the years ahead. As a company, we've made tremendous progress. We're managing capital effectively. We're maintaining our market discipline and taking actions to permanently reduce our cost base while growing long-term value.","So with that, I'd like to say thank you very much for listening to us. And in terms of the questions that you may have with respect to the modeling, Lucy and Laura will be available to answer your questions. So please go ahead and have a safe and happy day. We'll see you soon. Thanks. Bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the Company completes their prepared remarks, the lines will be open to take your questions.","Your host for today\u2019s call is Laura Gagnon, Vice President Investor Relations of the Mosaic Company. Ms. Gagnon?","Laura C. Gagnon","Thank you. And welcome to our First Quarter Fiscal Year 2013 Earnings Call. Presenting today will be Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We also have members of the senior leadership team available to answer your questions. We also have \u2013 Larry will discuss key drivers of the segment results as well as provide insight into future expectations. The presentation slides we are using during the call are available on our website at mosaicco.com.","We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call the statements include but are not limited to statements about future financial and operating results. They are based on managements\u2019 beliefs and expectations as of today\u2019s date October 2, 2012 and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties.","Actual results may differ materially from projected results. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued this morning and in our reports filed with the SEC.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko","Good morning. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings discussion. I am pleased to report that Mosaic delivered another solid quarter despite a wide array of external and logistical challenges.","Today, I have three goals. First, to help you understand the various external factors both economic and sentiment related that are impacting our business. Second, to review our results and progress on strategic objectives and finally to convey our confidence in Mosaic\u2019s very bright long-term future. Simply put, we want to be the world\u2019s leading crop nutrition company and we believe we are well on our way to achieving that vision.","First a quick review of the numbers. We reported operating earnings of $610 million on revenue of $2.5 billion for the quarter. The potash business contributed $416 million and the phosphates unit generated $208 million in operating earnings.","In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.01 which includes $0.02 per share of negative impact from notable items. It\u2019s important to point out that we continue to maintain a very strong cash position with $3.6 billion of cash on hand.","I can\u2019t remember another time in my career when so many of the outside influences that impact our business and global food supply were so volatile. Mother Nature has left much of the planet very thirsty, while also battering us with tropical storms, hurricanes and heavy rainfall in Canada.","The North American drought pushed grain and oil seed prices to record highs and the situation is compounded by the growing logistical challenge of the receding the Mississippi River. Drought has depleted the corn crop in the U.S. Heartland, the wheat harvest in Russia and rice in India.","Global grain and oil seed stocks are dropping quickly and reaching dangerously low levels. Farmers know this well, and they will once again have strong incentive to maximize yields in the coming seasons. It will likely take two years of trend yields to get stocks back to secure the levels.","As a result, prices have climbed dramatically, if the fall harvest continues various potential for grain and oil seed prices to go even higher in order to balance demand with supply. Given the current (inaudible) balance in grain and oil seeds prices are going to remain highly sensitive to weather events. Any indication of a potential negative impact of weather on yields in South America is likely to drive prices still higher. In fact, spring corn planting in Brazil is only 7% complete versus 15% at this point last year due to a prolong dry period.","As a result of the historically high grain and oil seed prices, crop nutrients are as affordable as they\u2019ve ever been, as the slide makes clear. Remember it was only a few months ago when experts were predicting some $4 dollar corn, even if grain and oil seed prices were to drop significantly, we would expect to continue to deliver strong results.","Financial returns on the farm in many parts of the world are at record levels. The USDA predicts U.S. farmers will realize record cash income and gain in 2012, for the third consecutive year or even part by payouts of crop insurance.","In India, cash payouts and farmer returns are increasing along with higher on farm prices for nutrients. And in Brazil, economics remained strong and farmers there are expected to plant record acres of beans and corns.","We expect the markets to remain temperamental for the near future. So I\u2019ll focus there for a few minutes. We are often asked, why crop nutrient prices have lost the historical correlation to grain and oil seed prices. The short answer is sentiment and risk aversion. Our own Dr. Mike Rahm, recently published in depth commentary on this subject in our Market Mosaic, publication, which you can find on our website that I\u2019ll summarize briefly here.","When fertilizer prices spiked in 2008, the commodity markets in general were reaching new heights. Remember that oil hit a $145 a barrel and demand for oil persisted. The macro economic environment today is considerably weaker. Because of that and other external factors including weather and uncertainty of North American application rates, we\u2019re seeing a continued high level of risk aversion from our customers to distributors.","They don\u2019t want to get stuck on the wrong side of a potential price decline. So they are keeping the fertilizer bins nearly empty.","For potash, shipments are being impacted by the delayed China and India contracts along with more production capacity coming on line. This has led the market to assume there will be readily available supply later in the season, which in turn makes it easy for distributors to differ purchase decisions.","It\u2019s important to distinguish between sentiment impacting recent food market trends which continues rapidly and economic fundamentals which will drive long-term performance. A change in sentiment usually starts with a catalyst. Let me describe a few possibilities.","In potash, standard grade is plentiful, with granular have different story. Producer inventories of standard grade potash were high because of delayed shipments to India and China. Once these shipments materialize and believe me they will, inventories are likely to drop, thus changing market sentiment.","In phosphates, supply uncertainties remain, with low and declining North American producer inventories, some Mosaic production constraints, continued delays with the modern startup and 30% lower exports from China.","And finally, uncertainties surrounding farmer demand resulting from the 2012 drought is already beginning to resolve favorably. The impact of accelerating demand maybe exacerbated by logistical issues presented by the low river levels which may lead to issues with timely delivery for raw fertilizer demand in North America.","Any of these factors can create customer concerns about availability and price which could change sentiment very quickly, in which case sentiment will catch up with a very favorable fundamentals I described earlier.","Now, I\u2019ll move on to the potash market. As you\u2019re well aware, our expansion then the tolling agreement reversion will give us significantly increased capacity. And we are confident that long-term demand for the product will grow. The current dip in demand we believe is essentially a timing issue and we\u2019re beginning to see improving dealer sentiment North America and elsewhere.","In fact, I was with our global sales team late last month and I heard a very positive tone from that group, representing all the major agricultural markets. Dealers are going to fill their beans at some point and we will have the product ready for them. And next year, we expect record demand for potash, with global demand reaching 58 million tons to 60 million tons. To meet the long-term demand, we are continuing to execute our potash expansion projects and they remain on budget and on time.","As an example, and as you can see in our slides, our Esterhazy K3 head frame is now in place, claiming the title as the tallest structure in Saskatchewan. While we expect demand to pick up, we are also aware of new supply coming on line. Over the next few years, we expect the operating rates across the industry to remain high as new capacity lags increasing demand. At Mosaic, we will continue to meet that demand.","The phosphates market in contrast with potash is very tight. We and producers have low inventories of finished product because of high demand, the situation that has been exacerbated by plant turnarounds and production and logistics disruptions.","Global supply uncertainty continues to tighten the market. We expect a 6% to 8% increase in global phosphate shipments in calendar 2012, followed by a 3% to 5% increase in 2013 to a record level of 64 million to 66 million tons.","Overall, our two business units generated solid performance given the market conditions and various operating challenges during the quarter. It\u2019s clear that our results are benefiting from our diversification with leadership positions in two essential crop nutrients. More important, we continue to make good progress on our strategy and Mosaic is positioned for long term success.","With that, I\u2019ll ask Larry Stranghoener to take you through our financial performance and outlook. After that, I\u2019ll conclude with some further thoughts on the market center future. Larry?","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. We delivered solid results despite weak market sentiment and the logistical issues that Jim mentioned. As you can see on my first slide, revenues were down year-over-year. Phosphate revenues were down 30% due to both lower volume and pricing. Potash revenues were up 10% reflecting flat year-over-year average pricing and higher volumes. That said, the year-over-year comparisons mask the divergence we\u2019ve seen between the potash and phosphate markets over the past six months.","As Jim said, tight phosphate markets are driving higher pricing and slower potash markets are leaving prices flat to slightly down. Net operating earnings were down in the quarter as a result of lower revenues. Note that our consolidated gross margin rate increased year-over-year from 28% to 30%.","Moving to the potash segment, operating earnings were up as a result of higher revenues. Our margin rate was down due to higher brine management expenses, and the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns, partially offset by a $34 million benefit from an unrealized gain on derivatives.","During the quarter, the potash operating rate was low at 65%, primarily as a result of extended plant shutdowns to tie and new expansion projects. Given the weakness in international demand, we took the opportunity to take extra days for turnarounds resulting in 119 turnaround days this quarter compared to 76 a year ago. These dynamics lead to our lowest quarterly production levels in over two years.","Sales volumes met our expectations, while pricing was higher than our guidance. Though North American producer inventory levels remained higher than average, we have seen declines three months in a row.","For Mosaic, there was a notable difference by type and grade of product. Much of our inventory is standard grade and blend grade product is much more limited. Brine management cost was $67 million for the quarter considerably higher than the year ago, but consistent with last quarter. Most of the incremental spent continues to go toward advanced technologies including horizontal drilling.","We expect second fiscal quarter cost to be similar to the first. We also expect fiscal 2013 cost to exceed the fiscal 2012 level although we expect the quarterly run rate to decline in the second half of fiscal 2013. While costs have been elevated, I should remind you that our production at Esterhazy has never been effected by brine inflow and Esterhazy remains cost competitive.","Before I move on to phosphates, I want to explain the dynamics of our tolling agreement and our Canpotex allocation process. The tolling agreement reversion goes into effect in January and all else being equal that would increase our Canpotex allocation from 37% to 43%.","To-date, these tolling tons, approximately 1 million annually have not been included in our tons sold metric. We sell these tons at costs and both the revenue and the cost of good sold income statement lines reflect this. Based on the tons shipped to PCS and market prices we received during fiscal 2012, selling these tons for our own account would have increased fiscal 2012 gross margin by over $200 million.","Going forward, the impact will depend upon prices and volume sold which in turn could be impacted by further changes in Canpotex allocations. Canpotex allocations are subject to change on January 1 or July 1 of each year, but only a number brings expansion projects online after conducting an audited proving run substantiating the increased capacity. If the new peaking capacity is higher than the old capacity, the Canpotex allocation is modified accordingly.","In the phosphate segment, both volumes and prices were down year-over-year. Shipments to major export markets especially India were down and shipments were also effected by the production, logistical and weather issues we\u2019ve mentioned.","We began the quarter with very low inventories, and during the quarter our chemicals plant were down roughly twice as long as in prior years due to more extensive planned annual maintenance, as well as delays due to tropical storm Debby.","Additionally our facilities in Louisiana lost to weaker production due to hurricane Isaac. As a result our chemical plant operating rate during the quarter was 81%. Prices rebounded from our fourth quarter with an average selling price increase of $35 per ton which was inline with our expectations and guidance.","Our gross margin rate was flat sequentially as expected. Lower rock costs were offset by higher ammonia costs, lower concentrated operating rates, and a seasonally higher proportion of lower margin blend products. Blends constituted 28% of sales tons in this segment versus 18% last quarter. As in the past, we\u2019ve included raw material cost in the appendix to our earnings presentation.","Next quarter, we expect to continuing positive impact from lower rock costs and a lower proportion of blend volumes offset by higher ammonia costs. We expect the second quarter gross margin rate for this segment to be relatively flat with the first fiscal quarter rates.","Phosphate mine productivity remains a highlight. South Fort Meade is now back to full operation and we have replenished our rock inventories. Phosphate rock production in Florida was 3.8 million metric tons in the quarter compared to 2.8 million tons last year. We expect to resume shipping Florida rock across the Gulf of Mexico to our Louisiana operations later this month, which will lower the use of third party purchased rock.","During the quarter, our Florida team achieved significant sustainability improvements in water use allowing us to cancel a $50 million investment in treatment facilities. That win resulted in a $7 million asset write-down related to frontend engineering for the project.","Before concluding, I\u2019ll provide updates to our guidance. We expect second quarter potash volumes to range from 1.6 million tons to 1.9 million tons. To reach the upper-end of the range we would need a return of demand from India and China. Given current demand we are experiencing price pressure, but we expect prices to remain in the range of $420 to $450 per ton.","We expect operating rates to be above 70% assuming no benefit from foreign exchange in the potash segment cost of good sold, continued low operating rates will pressure the gross margin rate in the second quarter.","In phosphates, second quarter sales volumes are expected to range from 3.0 million to 3.4 million tons. Our ability to reach the high-end of that range depends on a strong fall application season as well as highly effective operating execution in our phosphates facilities. Tight markets are likely to continue, increasing our expected average price to a range of $520 to $550 per ton. Operating rates should improve sequentially.","We continue to expect our capital expenditures to be in our guidance range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion even with additional capital we have committed to conduct front-end engineering technology and permitting work to expand our ammonia facilities. We expect to reach a decision on this project by the end of this calendar year.","Now back to Jim for his concluding comments.","James T. Prokopanko","","Thanks Larry. This year\u2019s global harvest is coming in much smaller than expected. You\u2019ll recall that spring in North America started with great expectations for a record corn crop with 96 million acres planted. The rain necessary to nourish all that corn never arrived and wide swaths of the crop withered, hot and dry conditions were a norm across the globe, with crops damaged from the Black Sea nations to India and China.","The harsh climates and commodity prices are a powerful rally, and ultimately these conditions will drive strong demand for crop nutrients in the coming 18 months.","This summer reminds us once again that food security is very fragile. You heard me speak on the subject before, but it is worthy of repetition.","The world will go to 9 million people by 2050, and human prosperity is also rising, bringing with it demand for higher quality food. Many estimate state that a billion people are now under nourished, so global agriculture challenge is great. We have to vastly increase food production with very little additional land devoted to farming, which means crop yields must increase.","Farmers simply cannot meet the demand without balanced crop nutrition, and Mosaic is here to help them raise to that challenge. Mosaic has unique strengths, our global reach, our innovation, our capital and our assets not only to make an important contribution to feeding the world, but also to outperform of competitors and deliver value to our shareholders. Our story is long in the future, because the future is enormously promising for Mosaic.","We continue to make important strides so that we can realize that promise. Our programs to achieve operating excellence are bearing fruit. Our phosphate mines are delivering record productivity, our safety performance continues to build on our excellent 2012 results and our sustainability work continues to deliver meaningful value for our communities and shareholders.","Our innovation lead is increasing, micro essentials has gaining and ever growing share with the phosphate market and we continue to make progress in our process technologies.","Our potash expansions are on time and on budget. During our planned turnaround at Esterhazy, we integrated our new K2 plant. Over the next few months, this capacity will be available to meet our customers\u2019 needs when demand rebounds and our capital strength continues to differentiate Mosaic.","We have the capital and cash flow to withstand market swings, to seize compelling growth opportunities as they arise, to fund our ongoing potash expansion projects, and to return capital to shareholders.","Overall, we feel great about the foundation we\u2019ve built in eight years as a public company and we feel even better about our ability to fulfill our mission to help the world grow the food it needs.","Now, we\u2019ll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley, your line is open.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you and good morning everyone. I just have a couple of questions about China. First, if we look at where retail prices have gone in China, in recent weeks it have been going down and the present prices looks like it was very difficult for the importers to roll the contract over at a flat price and actually make any profit filling the product in country. So it is what we are looking at that we need the inventory levels in China to come down so that local prices can go up there in order for you to settle or how should we be thinking about that dynamic?","James T. Prokopanko","Hello, good morning, Vincent. You got it about right. There is a good inventories of potash and you are referring to potash of course\u2026","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Yes.","James T. Prokopanko","Good inventories of potash in China and that is \u2013 and so that\u2019s given the cushion to differ moving on a nearby contract. What will happen over the next few months is that, NPK production is going to start building, inventory is going to start drawing down, and they are going to be faced with having to replenish their potash pipeline. So this market will clear, we\u2019ve got to find that price, it hasn\u2019t happened yet, but it\u2019s just the matter of weeks or couple of months before that will happen. I\u2019m going to ask Richard McLellan to add some color on the China market if he would like to. Rick?","Richard N. McLellan","","Yeah. Thanks Jim. Good morning Vincent. In China, we\u2019re seeing the domestic prices decrease, so the retail prices to the farmer and this is reflected from lower import prices coming in by (inaudible) into the north. There\u2019s no contract, but spot prices have decreased above $20 a ton. And part of that I think is the \u2013 is an indication that we will be able to roll over the existing price in today\u2019s market situation, but we still will find the clearing price to go to China as soon as inventories are cleaned up.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So just to follow-up, I guess it sounds like you\u2019re saying you\u2019re expecting to settle China not flat but actually down. It\u2019s just the question of when you do that. Is that correct?","","Richard N. McLellan","The market situation right now would tell us that prices we look forward will be difficult at this time. I won\u2019t make the comment about what we expect to close it at, we just know that they will have to clean those inventory.","Vincent Andrews \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and just as lastly, as a follow-up, and your guidance for the first quarter when you talk about the high end being a function of when you settle India and China, we\u2019re obviously already a month into the quarter and you\u2019re talking about weeks or maybe months before you settle India, so can you just give us a sense of what that volume guidance range would be ex India and China.","James T. Prokopanko","Frankly we\u2019ve got in our guidance, tons going to India, and India and China at the end of the quarter. And our guidance range would, if nothing happens in both markets, would move to the lower end of the guidance, closer to the mid point.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Market. Your line is open.","Joel D. Jackson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Hi, good morning thank you. I just want to talk about your cost, maybe you can give a bit of guidance or your trend (inaudible), ammonia pricing on \u2013 you mentioned some commentary on your rock purchases, so maybe give some commentary on how you see rock purchases going forward and meet the possibility to send the rock market. And finally also if the current \u2013 is the current brine management cost at Esterhazy, is that a good run rate going forward?","James T. Prokopanko","","Yeah, good day Joel. So you have two questions, one on the input cost and brine management cost. So I am going to have Joc O'Rourke speak to that or operations related.","James C. O'Rourke","","Okay, Joel good morning.","Joel D. Jackson \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning.","James C. O'Rourke","I\u2019ll take these one at a time, first of all ammonia price, we\u2019ve seen ammonia price increasing over the last couple of quarters. We expect that be flat or slightly up over the next few quarters. Rock purchases, importantly as we\u2019ve increased our rock production in Florida, we\u2019re now on a situation where later this month we\u2019ll start exporting from Florida to Louisiana which will bring down our net cost of rock fairly significantly as we stop using \u2013 or stop, use a lot less import rocks than we have in the past. So that expects prices there to come down. Sulphur flat probably over the next couple of quarters. In terms of brine management, as Larry mentioned in his text, we expect cost to be similar for the next quarter and then declining for the second half of this fiscal year.","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","And Joel, it\u2019s Larry Stranghoener, if I could just clarify a comment Joc made, when Joc referred to flat ammonia prices, he was referring to current purchase prices for ammonia. The cost of ammonia we actually realized in the first quarter will likely go up substantially in the second quarter and then remain sort of at those levels for the rest of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank, your line is now open.","Ben Isaacson \u2013 Scotiabank GBM","Thank you very much. I was hoping we could spend a little bit more time on MicroEssentials just understanding how it\u2019s progressing in the various markets and what the strategy is going forward.","James T. Prokopanko","Thanks, Ben. Thanks for asking that question. MicroEssentials has been a real success \u2013 innovation success story at Mosaic. It\u2019s a product that\u2019s between ourselves and our legacy company. It\u2019s been worked on for 10 years and we are really quite thrilled with the take-up that we are seeing in the market. We\u2019ve expanded our production to now with capacity of almost 2.3 million tons of MicroEssential product production capacity, that\u2019s nearly a quarter of our phosphate capacity and I think the numbers of phosphate tons that we are selling, 1 ton in 10 tons of phosphate sold in the U.S. is a MicroEssentials ton. So in a really short period of time, we\u2019ve really brought a value added product to the market really benefitting the farmers. I\u2019m going to ask Rick to give some details on what\u2019s happening in terms of margins and cost production of that material.","Richard N. McLellan","Yeah. Good morning, Ben. As Jim said, we are seeing very good market penetration in North America, but we\u2019re also focusing on South America as well. We\u2019ve seen a consistent increase in Brazil of the amount of product being used and I think the most important piece to take away is farmers are using these products and dealers are selling them because they are increasing yield, and this is about creating more value for the dealer as well as ourselves and the farmer, and that\u2019s where our focus is on. Our pricing, we\u2019re generating more margins on a per ton basis as well as we\u2019re growing our business with those customers that we do MicroEssentials with. So it\u2019s been a significant component of our phosphate go to market strategy and we continue to see that increasing and we\u2019ll be looking for other opportunities to expand production.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.","P.J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets","","Yes, hi good morning. Jim what is the impact of any residual P&K that is left in the soil in the U.S. after low yields? And do you believe that growers are likely to test their soils first and then possibly delay the fertilizer application to the spring?","James T. Prokopanko","","Well good day. Good day P.J., good to hear from you. Yeah it\u2019s a topical question getting much discussion in the industry in the farm markets. First, the question about residual P&K in the soil, P&K, I think you\u2019re aware unlike nitrogen is residual in the soil for some period after it\u2019s been applied. So when you apply a ton or 100 pounds of these to a field it\u2019s going to be there for a couple of years. But at the same time, when you apply it, it is not all readily available to the plant. So if you apply 100 pounds of phosphate to a field, it\u2019s going to take three to five years for that to be completely available to the farm field. So yes, the droughts in some badly effected drought areas, the P&K take up by the plants might not have been as much they were in a normal year. However, most soils in the U.S. don\u2019t have the necessary levels of P&K in the soil. So farmers have been drawing down on the P&K banks in many parts of the country and they didn\u2019t start with a healthy balance.","So we believe that they\u2019ll be in the worst effected areas, Indiana, Illinois, where we saw some pretty dramatic yield reductions. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 we would see a bit of a tail or drop-off on the phosphate and potash application. But they didn\u2019t have a surplus to start. So we think that this coming year in some areas we can see a reduced \u2013 reduction of P&K. However, offsetting that is we went into the summer season following this past spring with warehouse stocks very much depleted, there is nothing to pull on. ","So the pipelines after we feel some farmers may use a little less P&K this year, the net result for us is that our sales that should be similar this coming fall season as they were last year. Now farmers, now do testing, they test, it\u2019s a good agronomic practice once every three years. I think it would be good to, smart for farmers to test the soil, see with the P&K is, but with the high-high grain prices, oil seeds, corn, wheat the incentive is strong for farmers to plan to maximum yielding crops and that is going to take strong fertilizer application rates to get there. [Audio Gap] I\u2019ll turn it over to Rick to talk about what\u2019s happening from his perspective with dealers as a result of this drought.","Richard N. McLellan","","Yeah, good morning. I think one of the things I just add on to Jim\u2019s comment on soil testing. It happened to be at a lunch and sat with a guy that operates a major Midwestern soil testing lab and he has never been busy. So farmers are going to test to see what\u2019s in the soil, but I think we are getting feedback from the dealers now as harvesters getting to the midway point that because of strong commodity prices improved in some areas rains after Hurricane Isaac as well as demand for winter wheat planting. We are seeing growers, our dealers move from what had been planned to be a very conservative fall application season moving back to one that at least at average if not slightly above.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan ","Thanks, two-part question. I think your original estimate of brine info cost that you made in February was 170 to 180 for fiscal \u201812 and you came in at 206 and now you\u2019re annualizing at roughly call it 270. So what happened? Why are the costs greater? ","And second, I think China has imported something like 5.5 million tons so far this year versus 4 million last year, so they are up 32% and I guess pretty much all the other potash producers other than Canpotex have really lifted their volumes into China and Canpotex is down about 20%. So can you talk about the dynamic such that Canpotex [seems to be doing] a lot less business in the China market and then what that might mean for trying to purchases to the end of the year.","James T. Prokopanko","Okay, Jeff, thank you. I\u2019m going to have [Jeff] talk about what\u2019s happened with the brine cost and what some of the new actions we are taking in (inaudible) and then I\u2019ll return to your China potash performing.","Unidentified Company Representative ","Thanks, Jeff. In terms of our brine, we have increased our spending and particularly that\u2019s our new technology such as horizontal drilling. More recently we\u2019ve been using some latex growth et cetera to really aggressively manage our brine, but we do expect this cost to decrease in the second half of fiscal year as Larry mentioned. Remember also, we had never affected production in the 25 years that we\u2019ve been managing this brine, so we think we\u2019re doing everything we can to aggressively fix the problem. And I\u2019ll hand it over back to Jim.","James T. Prokopanko ","Jeff, the potash question, which I know is a good question, yes we were down, we\u2019re seeing China imports up 32%, 33% over the year, and that as Rick mentioned is coming from northern borders rail shipments into China. So although Canpotex has lost some tons in China, we\u2019ve had that made up in other parts of Asia, Indonesia, Malaysia we\u2019re seeing very strong sales into those markets. And so in the end, we\u2019re not seeing a net-net, we\u2019re looking at a year for Canpotex its going to be largely unchanged, products moved around a bit, little bit more into Brazil, good bit more into Southeast Asia, and the economics are working at this point in time for some of the Russian product to be a better fit into the Chinese market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Your line is open.","Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group","","Thank you. Jim, a question on your potash slide on 9, where I guess you get a rather bullish case for fiscal \u201813 that the shipments will rebound. Question would be where have you seen the most destocking and is your forecast for shipment increase in \u201813 driven by higher consumption or a rebuilding of inventories or some combination of both?","James T. Prokopanko","Good day, Don. Good to hear from you. What we\u2019re seeing on destocking question is North America this past spring has really destocked that pipeline. Recall that going into the spring, we had a huge crop expected lot of acreage planted and people were getting ready for sub $4 corn and as a result people were careful about not being stuck with inventory going into the summer, so the inventories were low there. ","We\u2019re seeing [in India destocking] of the pipeline as a result of the government subsidy program, the farmers haven\u2019t been changed were the subsidy payment for potash and phosphate was reduced, netting in a result of higher fertilizer prices to farmers, farmers reduced PNK use and they just put more nitrogen. And now it\u2019s interesting you see the fertilizer industry in India starting to lobby for lower subsidy payments to farmers on nitrogen to get it back into balance. They\u2019ve just gotten so far out of whack in balance. And those are the principle markets where we seem to destocking, North America and India. And I\u2019m going to just ask Rick, if he\u2019d like to add to that answer.","Richard N. McLellan","Good morning, Don. I can\u2019t add much more Jim other than we see the market in Brazil pretty brisk demand. They started with inventory to begin the year and they\u2019re on a record phase for shipments to continue from the first half and we expect their inventories to be drawn down as well. And then if you look in the phase of strong agricultural fundamentals for 2013 that will in turn dry up the demand side. So we\u2019re going to see supply clean out and we\u2019re going to see demand increase.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Your line is open.","Jacob Bout \u2013 CIBC World Markets","Good morning. Maybe just a follow-on on slide 9 there. So looking at the growth and your forecasted demand from 2012 to 2013, looks like you are seeing basically going from 53 million to 59 million tons. What is your assumption on the potash pricing there? And effectively, what I\u2019m trying to get out here is, how sensitive do you think the potash demand in 2013 is going to be to potash pricing? And maybe you can talk specifically on your thoughts on that sensitivity in Brazil, India and U.S.?","James T. Prokopanko","Good day, Jacob. That is an excellent question for our Dr. Michael Rahm to answer.","Mike Rahm","Good morning, Jacob. You are right that we have about a 6 million ton increase projected for 2013. About two-thirds of that comes from India, North America, and Indonesia, Malaysia. And so in terms of pricing, when you look at farm economics, particularly in India as well as North America, rice economics in India are at record highs. Wheat economics are probably the second best ever and in North America very strong economics. So I think as Jim alluded to earlier with potential modifications in the subsidy in India, we expect a very good rebound there. ","And in the case of North America, we\u2019re seeing 18% rebound in shipments in North America due to swings in the pipeline and for the first two months of the year, we\u2019ve seen shipments increase 17%. So I think in terms of the price assumptions, we see fairly stable outlook for prices and given strong farm economics, we think that translates into a big increase in potash shipments in 2013.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities ","Good morning. Mike, on a similar question on pricing and the hopeful convergence of North American, Chinese and the Indian prices, you are trying to sell down 20,000 ton this year. Does that have to \u2013 in the near term bring down U.S. prices or is that just delay the eventual convergence of those two metrics. And just lastly on Brazil despite the strong demand, we\u2019ve seen price (inaudible) function of increased competition, globally weak supply demand or is there something else underlying that why [are billion] prices high given the strong demand.","James T. Prokopanko \t","Hello David, we have Dr. Rahm answer your first question and Rick McLellan will answer the second question about Brazil pricing.","Mike Rahm","Yeah, I think it\u2019s important to, as we alluded to in the commentary that you have to distinguish between standard and granular product. Standard product in terms of the large Asian markets, there is simply more inventory of that product than granular. So I think there is a distinction between those two prices. In the case of Brazil, we have a situation where given the slower movement in some of the other markets, there has been a strong competition for demand in that particular market. Rick, I\u2019ll pass it over to you in terms of other comments.","Richard N. McLellan","Yeah, I think David, if you want to think about where you need to see convergence, we need to see convergence of import blend grade in the Brazil market. And as we came into this quarter, they were fairly close to be in even and so looking at prices because standard product goes into different markets, it can show this international price to be larger than what it really is. So we\u2019ve seen pressure in Brazil. Mike did a good job of describing just what\u2019s happening there, it\u2019s a time period. We\u2019ve seen prices slide there about $30 a ton. We had planned a price increase in North America of about $25 a ton and that is not going to take place. So we are going to continue to see the Brazil market and the North America market find a price where it\u2019s going to operate at and they are relatively close as they are today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Mccarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Kevin Mccarthy \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. I guess my question relates to prospects for international potash shipments, maybe two parts. First part on Canpotex allocation, you\u2019ve indicated the step-up from 37% to 43% in January. Could you comment on how that 43% is likely to change over the next year or two as various industry participants prove out capacity. ","And then second piece, I take the 43% versus 37%, it implies something like 16% step-up on a tonnage basis or else how constant? Your forecast obviously is that we\u2019ll see growth in places like India, Indonesia, Malaysia et cetera. So if I boil all that down, would it be reasonable to expect growth in the 20% plus range from January for Mosaic in international markets?","James T. Prokopanko","Good day, Kevin. Sorry, I got your first question but I didn\u2019t quite catch the full second question, second part of your question. So we will allow you to ask that one more time, but I\u2019ll first address the 37% to 43%, that you got the math right and that is correct assuming there will be no other member of Canpotex is undertaking approving run which we wouldn\u2019t know about, that usually is fairly confidential and kept in-house. So we don't know if somebody else is running a mine, but we are not aware of that being the case. So with the reversion of the tons, we go from 37% to 43% and I know what we have coming is our Esterhazy expansion. ","We are on the edge of doing a proving run that. We don't expect that to be completed this calendar year, so we won\u2019t make the January date. So once we get that [done which will be] some time next year, we will have the opportunity to increase again our Canpotex share whatever we approved above our current peaking capacity in Canpotex. If other members have a proving one that they are running more accurate in the gate one of those. So, also I know is fairly confident that beginning January 1, we will have a 43% share of Canpotex. And I am going to ask you just to ask that question one more time.","Kevin Mccarthy \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Yeah, apologizes for my inelegantly stated second piece of it. I\u2019m just trying to get at the compounding effect of a rising Canpotex allocation coupled with what looks to be forecast for rising demand as well in the international markets that Canpotex serves. So for example, if I look at Mike\u2019s forecast for something [like 59 million] tons on a base of 53 million tons, that looks to be a 11% growth globally. I think there is a strong contribution within that from the international markets that Canpotex would serve as well. So, if I couple the two of the higher allocation rate and the growth overseas might that imply something on the order of 20% growth for Mosaic\u2019s specifically in international potash nutrient.","James T. Prokopanko","","Sorry, all are being equal Kevin, your math is, your math is generally correct.","Kevin Mccarthy \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from CSLA. Your line is open.","Mark Connelly \u2013 Credit Agricole Securities","Thank you Jim, just one question, as we watch ammonia prices by [cal] concern should we be that, it isn\u2019t moving into DAP faster, and given your comments on DAP it seems like that market should be skin tight and we ought to be able to take advantages of these rising ammonia prices are at least past from through more quickly, I\u2019m just wondering how much concern we should have about next quarter maybe getting a little bit squeezed?","James T. Prokopanko","Good day Mark. Good question, right now we are just on the crust of the fall season for North America. So yes we\u2019ve seen ammonia prices have strengthened, getting that pass through we have inventory of course, so we have to work that down first. But until we really see the North American market product go from dealers to the farms, dealers replenishing their inventories, and we believe that is coming, we\u2019ll start seeing some strengthening to phosphate prices, and we\u2019re showing increasing phosphate prices in our guidance going forward. Larry, would you do\u2026","Lawrence W. Stranghoener","Yeah, I would just add that. Mark, when we see some headwinds from ammonia cost (inaudible). But on the other hand see some benefits from continuing reductions at rock costs, which is a very good new story. And we\u2019ll see more percentage of plans on our phosphate sales going forward. So all in all, we would expect to see a gross margin in the second quarter, similar to the first. And then with some of these trends and continuing positive pricing momentum, continuing into the second half of late period and improved gross margin in the second half of (inaudible).","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Cowen from Barclays. Your line is open.","Matthew Cowen \u2013 Barclays","","Hey good morning, it\u2019s Matthew Cowen. Could you just talk a little bit about the potential impact of the lower levels through the end of the rest of the calendar year on phosphate shipments and whether that\u2019s just a matter of being able to procure the trucks and the rail needed to bypass the river? Whether that\u2019s something that you are able to do? And then what kind of additional cost that would add to the delivered price and if there is any worry about demand may be not being robust enough to face the additional cost? Thanks.","James T. Prokopanko","Hello Matthew, those three question for Rick McLellan, our commercial leader to answer.","Richard N. McLellan","Hey good morning Matthew. What we\u2019re seeing on the frankly barge movements up the river, is their move being slower, their toes are smaller, and barges are getting field later, so all that makes the trip up the river fairly lengthy trip. We are seeing is that product is getting, we\u2019re moving product in by rail into our warehouse system. And that\u2019s catching up, but the rail cost is probably $10 slightly higher a ton on a delivered basis, if you wanted to take look at to most markets. But the offset is that is a product in warehouses isn\u2019t unsold then it will see stronger pricing on a warehouse is up country then may be as reflect it at the Gulf or in Central Florida. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carroll from UBS. Your line is open.","Bill Carroll \u2013 UBS","Good morning, thank you. As you continue your feasibility study for an ammonia plant? Can you share some of what you learn so far in terms of costs and [setting] issues, timing et cetera? And how they might compare with what you had expected going in?","James T. Prokopanko \t","Good morning Bill, good question. With these ammonia prices you can well see in the cost of gas, you can see the attraction that ammonia has had to investors and despite some resistance by current producers saying it was not going to happen when you\u2019re making $400 to $500 ton gross margin on ammonia production, you\u2019re going to track new facilities. And so there is been of a bit of gold rush to building nitrogen plants, everybody has to have won and no wonder when you have 350 gas and $700, $800 ammonia that\u2019s which you\u2019re going to get. ","So we expect that with the rash of announcements that we\u2019ve seen. We will see more ammonia plants being built. We believe the further step ahead in our deliberations and analysis of this were best equipped I think to make use that ammonia being our self short about million tons of ammonia. So it looks like a very good project to us, lot of lot of attention and it looks like the very attractive kind of investment. So I\u2019m going to ask Joc, our work operations leader who\u2019s reviewing this project to tell you what is learned in last year of assessment.","James C. O'Rourke","Thanks Bill. Carrying on from more Jim is, I think we are three parts, you\u2019re asking capital cost, operating cost, and locations, clearly from a capital cost perspective. There is demand, because there is as Jim mentioned, bit of a gold rush for these plants. So there\u2019s probably a little bit of an extra demand for contractors and stuffs, so we may see a small escalation in cost of what we originally looked at, but in terms of operating costs 80% of the cost of making ammonia is straight from natural gas. So that we\u2019re pretty comfortable that\u2019s no change. In terms of location where we\u2019re going to be, and we\u2019ve got a number of options still open to us and that will depend on the cost of building in those places are permitting and just the overall, what would you say, overall feasibility of each of those locations compared to each other.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of the Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.","Michael Piken \u2013 Cleveland Research","Hi good morning. Just a quick question on Brazil and understanding the logistics there, we talked a little bit about the river levels here in the U.S. but that we felt that there\u2019s been a back up 30 to 60 days at some of the ports, and do you think that\u2019s going to impact the policies in that all and in terms of being able to get the farmers everything they need, and we\u2019re going to able to get everything in through the (inaudible) season as well and kind of what you can due to address that in the future? Thanks","James T. Prokopanko","Good morning Mike, we are raid on with the \u2013 concerning the question about Brazil logistics Rick McLellan, will give you some color on that.","Richard N. McLellan","Yeah, good morning Michael, it\u2019s a timely question, I just came back a week from visiting our port facility at Paranagua, Brazil, the public ports there had above 45 days of weight for product coming in our own port was more or like 15. So couple of questions; the first one will this impact deliveries into Brazilian country for planting. Right now it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s close to just in time as I\u2019ve ever seen it, and planting would have started at the first of September, I think you could have honestly said, we are going to experience some delayed deliveries. As it is, we\u2019ve got to the 1 of October until we\u2019ve seen significant kind of moves on bean planting. Everything is going to have to work right into Brazil to get the product into place, a lot of it is bought and paid for and farmers are going to be waiting for it to arrive. ","As far as future, we are looking and expanding our port facilities in Paranagua type of project to do just that. I think the key thing to remember is, these farmers need it, they can\u2019t plant the crop without having the fertilizer. Its soil test levels are very low and they need PNK to grow soybeans.","James T. Prokopanko","With that I\u2019m going to wrap up our call with these comments. Our first quarter results were impacted by very wide range of factors. Hurricane, drought, skittish markets, weak demand in India and China, low water in the Mississippi and I can go on from there. But I\u2019d like to leave you with this thought. Well we can precisely predict the timing, global demand for potash and phosphates is going to increase and Mosaic is in an excellent position to meet the demand. Thank you all for joining us and have a safe morning. Good day. ","Operator","And this concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
