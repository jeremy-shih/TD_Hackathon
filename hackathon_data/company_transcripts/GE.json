At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Christine and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you, Christine. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today second quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release, presentation and GE supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff Bornstein, and our Vice President Power and Water Steve Bolze. We\u2019ve asked Steve to join today to talk about the Alstom deal.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Great, Matt, thanks, good morning everyone. GE had a good quarter in a generally improving environment. We saw a solid economic growth across most of our segments. Some economic indicators are really quite strong like rail loadings, revenue passenger miles, demand for commercial credit and appliance market strengthened during the quarter. Global markets were also generally positive.","GE ended the quarter with a record backlog of $246 billion. A particular highlight was the payback of our investments in technology. We recorded $36 billion of wins at the Farnborough Airshow, transportation is prospering because of our commitments to push ahead with the Tier 4 locomotives, healthcare is gaining share behind several big product launches, in oil and gas the same broad interest to new subsea innovations.","There are still a few tough markets like U.S. healthcare and mining but the economic trend is positive. At the half execution is in line with our key goals, industrial segment growth is up 10% with 6% organic revenue growth and margin expansion of 30 basis points.","We're on track for $7 billion of capital earnings with the $3 billion dividend, capital allocation remains balanced and discipline, we've returned $5.9 billion to investors through dividends and buyback, we're improving the GE portfolio as well. The Alstom acquisition will generate attractive growth and returns while helping GE to accelerate our achievement of 75% industrial earnings.","Retail finance remains on track for an IPO by the end of July. The GE team is executing both operationally and strategically. Orders grew by 4% with slightly positive pricing, backlog is at a record high as I said of $246 billion, up $23 billion from last year. This was the strongest service performance in several years with growth of 14%, aviation spares grew by 16% and power gen services grew by 13%. Most of our service businesses are expanding.","Transportation orders were up close to 40% overall and we positioned the business to succeed in the future. We experienced some equipment order push outs particularly in wind and oil and gas and subsea however our rolling four quarter equipment growth is up 7% and growth markets remain a highlight with 14% order expansion and growth in six of nine regions.","Our orders and backlog give us confidence in the second half and 2015. Our operating execution was good, we have 7% revenue growth in the quarter with 20 basis points of margin expansion. We are gaining share. Farnborough made a statement about GE\u2019s position in aviation with $36 billion in wins. We won nearly 90% of all next gen narrow body announcements. As was reported earlier in the week, GE remained substantially ahead on the Tier 4 locomotive. We have 264 Tier 4 locos in backlog for 2015 and \u201816 with more on the way and this was zero in the first quarter, so our momentum is growing.","We have nine high efficiency large block H turbines in backlog with many more in the pipeline. In oil and gas, we sold the first 20k-psi drilling system to Maersk. We have $55 million backlog for the industry leading Revolution CT scanner. For the quarter, equipment revenue grew by 8% and service revenue grew by 5% and six of nine growth regions expanded in the quarter. In addition, a few of our adjacencies are performing quite well. Life Sciences had order growth of 10% while Water grew by 11% and we now expect $1.3 billion of productivity revenue for \u201914, slightly ahead of our operating plan.","Simplification and value gap continue to drive margins; we are reducing the structural cost of GE. For the year simplification, value gap and R&D efficiency should continue to be positive. In addition, we saw nice margin turnaround in energy management and appliances and lighting while transportation and health care are growing margins despite tough markets. We will continue to be negatively impacted by equipment mix for the year but we are on track for solid margin improvement in 2014 overall with expansion in most of our businesses. And in the quarter, six of our seven industrial segments had earnings growth. So, really a good execution quarter.","Our capital allocation is in line with plan. Total CFOA is $3.4 billion, down 9% year-to-date, industrial CFOA is above last year\u2019s total but below if you add back the impact of the NBCU taxes last year. CFOA is impacted by timing and long cycle orders in wind, driven by the lack of PTC clarity and in oil and gas. Additionally, we have more inventory for second half shipments, given the substantially higher organic revenue growth we expect in 2014 versus 2013.","We'll see strong improvement in working capital in the third quarter and second half. As previously communicated, we expect the capital dividend to be about $3 billion in 2014. We ended the quarter with $87 billion of cash and we expect CFOA for 2014 to be in the $14 billion to $17 billion range as outlined in our 2014 framework. We have a similar first half, second half profile that we had in \u201813.","Capital allocation continues to be disciplined and balanced. We have raised the dividend by 16% for \u201914; we have filed the red herring for RFS today, targeting a late July IPO. And this should raise roughly $3.1 billion at the midpoint price for 15% of the company. And we are targeting $4 billion of dispositions for the year.","In an important move for GE the Alstom deal is announced and signed targeting a 2015 close. This is an exciting opportunity for GE and our investors. By 2016, we expect this will add $0.06 to $0.09 per share and allow the company to have 75% of our earnings from industrial. The synergies and returns are excellent. And Steve Bolze is here this morning to give you an update on Alstom. So let me turn it over to Steve.","Steve Bolze","Thanks Jeff. We've had a lot going on with respect to the Alstom transaction. And I wanted to update you on the deal, our revised structure and our execution plans.","As you recall from our initial announcement on April 30th, the acquisition of Alstom's power and grid businesses would represent a largest single acquisition in GE's history. At the time we said it was subject to several reviews including our discussions with the French government. Those discussions have led now to our revised offer. We are happy with the outcome and have the unanimous recommendation of the Alstom Board and the endorsement of the French government.","A key point that I would like to stress is the deal economics remain the same and the price did not go up. Our deal is $13.5 billion of enterprise value at 7.9 times EBITDA and Alstom still retains its transport business. We have however revised the initial deal structure in payment terms. We will be selling our signaling business to Alstom transport and creating three joint ventures. GE will have operational control in these joint ventures and Alstom will be investing about $3.5 billion for its stakes. I will give further details on the ventures in a moment.","Although the structure has been modified our strategic rationale has not changed. The power sector is core to GE\u2019s future and it has excellent long-term growth prospects. Alstom Power and Grid are businesses we know and like and are being acquired at a good time in the cycle. What we like the most about Alstom is it complements us in technology, geography and they have great talent. It brings us broader scope and power, a larger installed base for services growth and larger presence in emerging markets.","Together with GE this creates opportunities to improve our combined performance and it\u2019s in our sweet spot. Also we continue to see good cost synergy opportunities and our plans remain intact. Overall, this is an attractive investment in a core business which expands our competitive capabilities and is accretive to GE earnings in year one with high teens IRR.","On the next page I want to ground you on the new deal structure. First, the changes do not impact the core businesses, which are Alstom\u2019s thermal assets. We will still own close to 100% of Alstom\u2019s gas and steam equipment and service businesses. About 86% of our synergies are in these businesses. With respect to the joint ventures Alstom will be the investor but GE will have operational control and we still have clear visibility to the remaining synergies.","The first JV is renewables. It\u2019s made up of Alstom\u2019s offshore wind and leading hydro business as well as some of thier new renewable technologies. GE and Alstom will each own 50% of this joint venture, onshore wind from Alstom will go directly into GE at 100%.","The second JV is the combination of GE's digital energy business and Alstom\u2019s grid business. GE and Alstom will each own 50% of the joint venture. And the third joint venture is global nuclear and French steam. We knew all along that with the majority of electricity generation in France being from nuclear power there would be nuclear sovereignty issues. This venture includes Alstom\u2019s production and servicing equipment for conventional island of nuclear power plants and development in sales of related new equipment globally.","It also includes Alstom\u2019s steam turbine equipment and servicing applications for France. In this joint venture, GE will own 80% of the economics and Alstom 20%. But Alstom will still have 50% of the voting interests. The sovereignty issues are address through a preferred share held by the French State with certain governance rights.","In each JV, GE has control, will appoint the CEO and expects to consolidate. Alstom will have standard minority governance rights and will have put options with the minimum four value at the fine time. These joint ventures will not impact or ability to achieve our synergies.","On top of these ventures one additional transaction that we agreed to sell our signaling business, a part of GE transportation. It's a good deal for both parties. We got a good price rate, a market multiple and it is a business that will do better as part of a larger signaling business that Alstom has. In addition to that, we will enter into a collaboration agreement for both services and commercial activities that should make both GE and Alstom\u2019s transportation businesses more successful. As for our presence in France and Europe, after Alstom\u2019s businesses join the GE family we expect to have over 100,000 employees in Europe. We have agreed to add 1,000 new jobs in France have factored this commitment into our financial plans.","In addition we have committed to keeping grid, hydro offshore wind and stream turbine headquarters in France. In summary the dealer returns remain unchanged, there will be 3.5 billion less cash invested upfront and a $0.01 to $0.02 reduction in EPS accretion.","So now let\u2019s look at our plans for execution. We still see 300 million in year one synergies growing to 1.2 billion in year five. We expect to realize 80% of the 1.2 billion in synergies by the third year. There are four main categories for synergies the first is optimizing the manufacturing and services footprints. The combined businesses have 16 major manufacturing sites and many more feeder sites. And about 70 service sites across the globe.","We estimate roughly 400 million of our savings here over the period. Second, leveraging the combined sourcing by to increase, productivity we have approximately 5 billion in common spend that we believe we can realize about 5% savings on. This is very consistent with our experience when we bought EGT from Alstom in 1999. The third area is combining our R&D efforts across the product lines, then lastly by consolidating supporting functions across SG&A we see the ability to get about 10% synergy here across the combined businesses.","We expect to spend approximately 900 million over the first five years to realize the 1.2 billion of cost savings. Beyond the $1.2 billion, we have assumed some modest revenue synergies, but see the potential for more upside. The teams have started to work to develop these additional growth opportunities. The current plan should drive $0.06 to $09 of EPS accretion in 2016, assuming a mid 2015 close.","We have now kicked off for integration planning with Alstom, so we can hit the ground running when the approval process is complete. This will be a broad GE effort spanning many parts of the company. We have appointed Mark Hutchinson, our overall GE integration leader. Mark is a GE officer with broad global experience and was most recently our CEO of China. We have formed a joint GE Alstom steering committee and had our first meeting last week in Paris.","From here, the process for closing will include works council consultations, Alstom shareholder approval and customary regulatory reviews driving an expected closing in mid 2015.","Overall, we are excited about the acquisition. We are confident in our ability to execute and we have a proven and experienced integration team now in place to ensure success.","With that, I want to hand it over to Jeff Bornstein.","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks Steve. I\u2019ll start with the second quarter summary here. We had revenues of $36.2 billion, up 3% from the second quarter of 2013. Industrial sales of $26.2 billion were up 7% and GE Capital revenues of $10.2 billion were down 6%. Operating earnings of $3.9 billion were up 7% and operating earnings per share of $0.39 were up 8%.","Continuing the EPS of $0.35 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. We had $41 million charge in the quarter in discops, primarily $30 million from WMC. WMC pending claims were down $700 million in the quarter and litigation claims were $1.3 billion higher. Reserves of $550 million are essentially flat versus the prior quarter with the slightly higher coverage of potential losses.","As Jeff said, CFOA year-to-date was $3.4 billion. We added industrial CFOA of $2 billion and received $1.4 billion of dividends from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was up 12% reported and down 41% excluding the impact of 2013 MBCU tax payments. This is driven by timing of orders and inventory build and was still on track for the $14 billion to $17 billion CFOA range that we guided for the year. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 19%, up from 17% last year bringing the year-to-date rate to 21%. As previously communicated, we expect the full year industrial rate to be above 20%. The GE Capital tax rate of a negative 13% was principally driven by the announced consumer Nordics disposition. The tax benefits from this transaction are anticipated to be higher than what we had planned for and with that we now expect a low single-digit tax rate for the full year.","We recorded roughly $260 million of tax benefits in the second quarter to bring the year-to-date rate in line with the expected lower full year rate. On the right side, you can see the segment results. Strong top-line growth of the industrial segment\u2019s revenues up 7% and operating profit growth up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 5% in the quarter on lower assets. Per our previous communication, the GE Capital results now include the impact of preferred stock dividends. For the quarter that was approximately a $160 million versus a $135 million in 2Q, \u201813.","I\u2019ll cover the dynamics of each of the segments on the following pages. First, I\u2019ll cover other items for the quarter. We had $0.03 of restructuring and other charges at corporate, about $0.02 of that related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to invest in simplification to improve the industrial cost structure. The spend was broad-based with projects in every business in corporate. We were executing on approximately 145 projects that average a year and half payback.","We also had a $0.01 one-time charge related to the write-off of an asset in our consolidated nuclear joint venture. We took 51% of the impact related to that write-off and our partners took the remainder. Offsetting the restructuring, we booked a gain related to the disposition of Wayne fuel dispensers business in oil and gas. We recorded a pre-tax gain at corporate of $90 million related to that transaction. The net impact of these two items was a $0.02 charge.","So to give some context, the gain came in about a $100 million lower than expected. Our restructuring spend of $300 million pre-tax also came in about a $100 million lower than planned. This was due to lower spend of about $70 million needed to execute the existing projects and some delays attributable to works councils for roughly $35 million.","In addition to the ongoing restructuring spend we had the one-time charge related to the nuclear asset write-off. So restructuring and other charges net gains of $0.02, ended up being a higher expense that we planned in the quarter. Now I\u2019ll take you through the segment starting with Power and Water.","Orders of $6.3 billion were up 6%, equipment orders were down 1% with distributive power down 32%, thermal down 9% and renewables up 60%. The decrease in distributive power was attributable to the timing of orders in the emerging markets that we expect to close in the second half. Thermal orders were lower on gas turbine orders, 10 versus 24 a year ago, partially offset by more BOP orders for balance plan.","First half gas turbine orders were 41 versus 32 a year ago. No change to our framework for a 125 gas turbine orders for the year. In the second quarter, we booked our first [H] gas turbine order for cogen application in Russia but we expect to ship that unit in 2015. Service orders were up 12% driven by PGS up 13% and strong demand for upgrades and parts. We expect a reasonably strong transactional outage season in the second half of the year. We booked 19 AGPs in the quarter versus 12 a year ago. Revenue in the quarter was higher by 10% to 6.3 billion, growth was driven by equipment up 20% and services up 2%. Equipment revenue was driven by thermal up 38% on two more gas turbines versus last year and higher BOP up 38%.","Wind equipment revenues were up 30% with 159 more wind turbines year-over-year. Thermal and wind growth was partly offset by lower distributed power growth which shipped 41 units this year versus 55 a year ago.","Our profit of 1.1 billion was up 4% driven by volume and simplification benefits offset by negative mix principally higher BOP and wind shipments. Product line mix was 2.4 points of a margin drag in the quarter. SG&A was down 7% in the quarter. Our outlook for the business for the total year has not changed. At the moment we are likely to be stronger on AGPs than we planned but may see some distributed power volume push. Gas and wind turbines remain within the framework we have shared with you.","Now for oil and gas orders were up 5% in the quarter to 5.3 billion equipment orders were down 9% versus a very strong second quarter in \u201813 when equipment was up 42%. Turbomachinery was down 42% versus up 74% last year. Subsea was down 44% versus up 30% a year ago. Downstream technology up 85% on strong petrochemical demand and drilling and service up 55% were strong in the quarter.","Drilling received a large order for our new 20,000 PSI drilling system, the first in the industry for Maersk and BP. The 20,000 PSI capability makes ultradeep offshore drilling possible in areas unavailable today. So, we're quite excited about the progress there.","Service orders are strong up 23% with Turbomachinery higher by 49% on increased upgrades insulations and transactional services. Downstream technology was up 35% and MNC was up 1%. MNC was up 19% excluding the impact of the [Wayne and Santis] dispositions.","Revenues of $4.8 billion were up 20% by equipment strength up 29% with subsea up 51% and Turbomachinery up 15%. Service revenues were higher by 11% versus the second quarter of last year.","Operating profit was up 25% on higher volume positive value gap and strong productivity offset partially by negative mix from subsea growth. Margin rates in the quarter improved 50 basis points.","On the next page Aviation. Demand for travel continued its strong growth, year-to-date May. Revenue passenger kilometers globally were up 6.2% with strength across all regions. Freight grew 4.4% May year-to-day. Orders in aviation were up 1% with equipment down 8% driven as we expected by commercial engine is down 27%, our lowest CFM orders in a non-repeated the FedEx CF6 order from last year. This was partially offset by stronger international military orders.","Service orders were 13% higher with spare parts orders -- the spare parts orders rate up 16% to $28.4 million a day.","As Jeff mentioned at the Farnborough Airshow, we won 312 LEAP engines on the Boeing bags. We also won 520 LEAP engines on the Airbus A320neo versus a 100 to the competition. For the A320neo program to-date we've won 54% of the engines. And in 2015 year-to-day the LEAP is on 67% of the engines on the A320neo. Overall since the launch, the LEAP engine has won 77% of all narrow body competitions. Operationally in the quarter revenues were higher by 15%, equipment revenues were also up 15% driven by commercial engines up 14% and military engines up 3%. We shipped 75 GEnx engines versus 33 a year ago in the quarter. Services revenue was up 15% with strength in commercial services partly offset by military services.","Operating profit in the quarter was 12% driven by higher volume positive value gap offset by negative mix associated with the GEnx shipments and higher R&D spend in the quarter. Operating profit margins of 19.7% was down 40 basis points in the quarter. Through the half margins are up 20 basis points. Overall Dave George and the aviation team continues to execute and win and we expect the technology investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make will sustain the momentum.","Next healthcare. Healthcare in the second quarter was again soft in the U.S. as we expected. In-patient volumes were weak which in conjunction with increased consumer resume and the changes in the Healthcare Law appear to be causing hospitals and the clinics continue to be cautious on the new investments.","Orders for the business of $4.8 billion were flat with emerging markets up 7% led by Latin America up 12% and China up 12%, offset by the U.S. down 2%. Equipment orders were flat with HCS down 4% offset partially by life sciences up 23%, up 5% organically. Service orders were up 1%. Backlog of $16.6 billion was 6% higher than a year ago. Revenues were flat with developed markets down 2% and emerging markets up 7% with strength in China, Latin America and the Middle East.","Operating profit was up 1% with strong cars productivity offset by negative value gap and FX. SG&A ex acquisitions was down 8% in the second quarter. Our profit margins improved 10 basis points, up 60 basis points organically.","For the second half, we expect the market dynamics to be similar to the first half with weakness in the U.S., but continued growth in life sciences and the growth regions. The business will continue to deliver on remaking the cost structure. And we expect that healthcare will grow earnings single-digits for the year.","Next, talk about transportation, the transportation team continues to execute well in a pretty tough environment. Domestic activity continues to improve though, carloads in the U.S. were up 4% for the first half driven by intermodal, petroleum and a very strong grain shipments and even coal saw 30 basis points of growth as post winter stockpiles a replenished.","Higher volume in conjunction with the first quarter whether effect have impacted velocity on the lines. As a result, part locos are at their lowest levels since 2007, 2008. We have seen increased orders activity in locos. At the beginning of the year, we communicated that we expected to ship about 600 units in '14. We now expect that that shipment number to be closer to 750 plus.","Balancing that, mining volume for both units and parts are week. We guided an expectation of being down almost 50% in 2014 versus '13 and now expect mining to be slightly weaker than that. Orders for the quarter were up 35% with equipment growth of 40% and service growth of 32%. Equipment strength was driven by North American locomotives including our first order for 39 Tier 4 locos for delivery in 2015.","Service orders were driven by locomotive parts and $125 million signaling went in Singapore. Backlog of 15.9 billion grew 13% from the second quarter of last year driven by equipment up 51%. Revenues in the quarter were down 18%, equipment was down driven by mining down 43% and lower loco and kit deliveries. Service revenue was down on weak mining parts partially offset by core services and loco parts. Our profit down 14% was driven by lower volume partially offset by positive value gap and cost out. SG&A was down 14% in the quarter. Operating margins improved 110 basis points on strong cost management.","Our total year expectations for transportation remain intact with better locomotive demand and deliveries offsetting slightly worse mining experience and the 50% down we expected. We feel good about our momentum on locomotives and are experiencing high utilization of our plants in 2014. Based on the first of market Tier 4 solution and improved rail volumes, we are optimistic that customers will continue to place orders in and for 2015.","Now energy management, the business took a couple of steps forward in the quarter but still remains very much a work in progress. Orders were down 14% in the quarter partly driven by no repeat of the big ComEd meter order last year in digital energy. As a result digital energy orders were down 32% but up 26% excluding the ComEd order. Industrial solution was down 8% on slow demand in North America and the exit as part of restructuring of seven subscale international platforms.","Power conversion saw a number of marine orders push into second half. Backlog continues to grow up 12% year-over-year. Revenue in the quarter was down 6%. Our profit more than doubled from last year to $69 million and margin rates improved to [$110] basis points. The team is doing a great job executing the restructuring strategies including reducing rooftops by 40%, simplifying their product structures and realigning their SG&A functions. Restructuring benefits are delivering productivity that more than offsets the negative volume.","We expect energy management to continue its improvement trajectory. Appliances core industry was up 5% the second quarter with contract up 8% and retail up 4%. Housing starts rebounded up 9%, helping volumes in the quarter and single family starts grew 5%, multifamily starts grew 18% in the quarter.","Revenue in the quarter was flat with appliances flat and lighting down 1% Appliance revenue was down 1 point on volume, but up 1 point on price. We read a number of promotional events that drove improvement during the quarter with revenue down 5% in April, up 1% in May and up 5% in June. So the trajectory is correct.","Lighting revenue was down 1% with strong LED growth of 50% offset by 9% down on traditional products as retails continue to bleed off incandescent inventories. Op profit of $102 million was up 23% on positive value gap and productivity. SG&A in the quarter was down 4% and op profit rate improved 90 basis points in the quarter.","Next is GE Capital. Revenue of $10.2 billion was down 6%, primarily from lower assets and lower gains. Assets were down 2% or $10 billion year-over-year. GE Capital's net income of $1.7 billion which includes $161 million of preferred dividend payment was down 5% on a comparable basis, as impact from lower earning assets and gains more than offset lower losses marks and impairments and higher tax benefits.","E&I of $371 billion was down $19 billion or 5% from last year and down $2 billion sequentially. Non-core E&I was down 15% to $51 billion versus last year. Net interest margins in the quarter of 5% were essentially flat. GE Capital's liquidity and capital levels continue to be strong. We ended the quarter with $76 billion of cash and Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel 1 basis improved 28 basis points sequentially and 51 basis points year-over-year to 11.7%.","On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable, the only exception being the seasonality we expect in UK mortgage but delinquencies in UK mortgage portfolio are actually down a 160 basis points year-over-year.","Now to walk through each of the segments. In CLL, commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with $174 billion of assets, flat to last year. On book core volume was $11 billion, down 3%, driven by the Americas which was down 4%. But we do see pockets of strength in the U.S., largely in equipment financing with our transportation business up 25%, vendor equipment leasing up 7% and our fleet business up 6%. Volume in CLL international was up 3%. The team is staying disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles and the new business returns were about 1.8%, roughly in line with the first quarter.","Earnings of $541 million were down 34%, driven by lower tax benefits from the non-repeat of last year\u2019s fleet candidate disposition and tax benefits we had in Europe as well as lower assets. These were partially offset by improvement in losses marks and impairments.","The consumer segment ended the quarter with a $135 billion of assets, flat to last year. Earnings of $472 million were down 43%, driven by lower international assets which were down 12%, year-over-year including the impacts of the Swiss IPO and BAY Thailand sale. In the current quarter, we also recorded roughly $85 million of after tax loss provisions as a result of recent legislation on consumer pricing in Hungary.","North American retail finance earned $512 million in the quarter, down 9% driven by continued investment in its standalone capabilities partially offset by 9% growth in its earning assets. Real-estate assets of $37 billion were down 11% versus prior year and down $1 billion sequentially. The equity book is down 26% from a year ago to 13 billion. Net income of 289 million was down 34% primarily from lower level of tax benefits and gains. In the current quarter, we saw 52 properties for the book value were above $420 million for $137 million in gain that's down $65 million from last year.","The verticals GECAS earned 343 million up 13% is lower impairments and higher gains offset the impact of lower assets which were down 9%. New volume was 1.5 billion, up [17%] with attractive returns of above 3% ROI's and we ended the quarter with zero aircraft on the ground.","Energy finance had a good quarter with earnings up 27% to $76 million driven by core income and lower level of loss and impairments. As I mentioned earlier, the tax rate at GE Capital is negative for the quarter and that was driven by the plan order transaction with 260 million of tax-to-up being both for the GE Capital Corporate. Excluding the tax-to-up the GE Capital tax rate would have been in the low-single-digits for the quarter.","As you look forward in the third quarter, we expect GE Capital to be about, be around about 1.6 billion in earnings. Overall Keith and the team continue to execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results. The Nordics dispositions which we expect to complete in the third quarter and the IPO of retail finance which I'll cover on the next page, are major steps from further reducing GE Capital's consumer footprint and focusing on the commercial core.","So we're announcing today that we're targeting the IPO of our North American retail finance business for the end of July we will be putting out a prospectus of a red hearing later this morning. We're limited to what we can say during the IPO process but we're pleased to be at the final stages of the IPO. We're targeting a 15% offering for about 3.1 billion at the mid-point of the price range. There is a potential additional 2.25% for the Green Shoe. As we said in the past the capital raise will remain within Synchrony to enhance its standalone capital and liquidity levels. There will be 1.5 billion of funded transitional financing from GE Capital. This is down from our previous estimate of about 3 billion.","The team has been doing a lot of work to strengthen their standalone capabilities on capital liquidity and governance. You may have seen that S&P and Fitch publish their investment grade ratings earlier this week for Synchrony. We are targeting the split off in late 2015 subject to regulatory reviews and approvals. Assuming a $3 billion IPO from 15% we would retain an approximately $70 billion position in Synchrony.","There are a lot of variables and the GE share count reduction will be dependent on the price of GE and Synchrony shares at the time of the split. We are still targeting 9.5 billion or less shares with this transaction. The process in on track and we\u2019ll update you along the way.","With that I will pass it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","","We have no change for the operating frame work for 2014, we expect double digit industrial operating profit growth behind solid organic growth and margin expansion. GE Capital earnings were on track for $7 billion excluding the impact of the preferred dividend. We will hit our simplification goals including a $500 million reduction in corporate expense we plan for restructuring to exceed gains which is a drag on 2014 -- benefit 2015 and beyond. Our CFOA and revenue remain on track. In fact I would say organic growth in probably closer to the high end of the range. We continue to move the company forward strategically. Our long-term investments in technology are really paying off with solid share gains and with the retail finance IPO and Alstom acquisition we are broadly reshaping the company.","I am proud of the GE team\u2019s ability to execute so well strategic and operationally on so many fronts and we're well-positioned for the future.","So Matt, now back to you and let's take some questions.","Matt Cribbins","Thanks. Christine, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Scott Davis of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi, good morning guys.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Scott.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Thorough presentation, so I appreciate that. I guess since we've got Steve there, I think just some logistical questions on Alstom. I mean did they still, I mean how do you keep the price from falling apart, I guess from now until you close it? I mean did they still bid on projects and compete against you till your close? Do you have some any control or oversight of how operations -- how things are run between now and then, because it's going to be a little while till everything gets approved?","Steve Bolze","Scott, listen we are two separate companies and we'll be through closing. As we said we have an integration planning effort that we have now kicked off, but we have a process that we have to go through works council approval to have a shareholder review and we have all the various regulatory steps to go through. So at this point, Scott they are separate, in some areas we do compete. But as I mentioned earlier these companies are largely complementary, complementary towards the geography, technology and it's a company we obviously know. And as you know Scott back in 1999 we bought the packaging business that was EGT that came to us and some of our best leaders came from that.","But in the short term we are separate and they are under their control.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, understood. And then couple of a niche here. I mean is there - when you think about Synchrony, is there and this is for Jeff and Jeff. But are there any structural or tax reasons why this business can\u2019t be sold in the process or post the IPO versus spun?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, Scott. I mean the reason we focus and we\u2019re heading down the path on the split is that it\u2019s very tax efficient for shareholders. So there is real value creation in doing the split offer, shares versus selling the business outright. ","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. Fair enough. And then just lastly, there is a lot of chatter on M&A in the space. I mean there is pressure points out there on Siemens and Dresser, does Alstom really cut you guys out at being able to go after some of the stuff if it becomes optimistic and you have white knight type scenario with Dresser? I mean it\u2019s a fairly unique asset. I mean could you -- I don\u2019t think I am asking you to comment just specifically on Dresser but on an overall basis, does Alstom really keep you out of the market or do you feel like you could still go in there and if need be issue equity or be creative about how to finance it?","Jeff Immelt","Yes, Scott. What I would say is on -- in our oil and gas business, we feel like we\u2019ve got a great coverage in terms of where we are right now. We really don\u2019t have any changes today on how we think about capital allocation and things like that. But look, we\u2019re always looking at the portfolio in terms of additional divestitures and things that we can do progressively inside the company. We\u2019re not done with that yet. And that can open up new capital allocation options. But we\u2019re really not -- we really today -- our focus is on -- our near-term focus is on the Alstom integration and doing a great job with that.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, good answer. Thanks guys and good luck.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks.","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi, thanks.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hey. Just had a question on the healthcare business. You talked back in December about how you might get close to 10% profit growth this year in healthcare, first half I think profits are down. So just maybe a quick update on your thoughts there?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, Julian. I think what we talked about was healthcare profit growth of high-single-digits, low-double-digits. I think given how we\u2019ve started the year, particularly in the U.S. and particularly in HCS, our expectations as of now are that we\u2019re going to grow operating profit in healthcare single-digit a share.","Jeff Immelt","I would say Julian the U.S. market continues to be tough. Outside the U.S., I think the team\u2019s executing pretty well overall. I would agree with Jeff\u2019s assessment on where healthcare are coming on the year. And I think the good part about GE is we have other segments that will be higher than our original expectations, so in total we still feel good about the overall framework of double-digit operating profit growth, industrial operating profit growth.","Jeff Bornstein","And within healthcare, I mean we still expect that we have expectations that growth markets will continue to grow for us, most of them double-digits, life sciences will have a great year, but the U.S. is going to be real headwind.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. And then just on the kind of GE-wide EBIT margin bridge I think in the first half, you had a value gap benefit to EBIT of about 200 million, I think in January you talked about a 200 million benefit for the year as a whole. So what should we expect for value gap in the second half as a EBIT driver?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes. So I think the guidance we gave is a couple of hundred million for the year; we\u2019re in very good shape through the first half. We still expect value gap to contract a bit in the second half as it relates to prices, we ship backlog particularly in power and water. But there is a chance, we could be a little bit better for the year on value gap but I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be markedly different than what we have shared with you previously.","Jeff Immelt","","I think [simplification] [ph] still on track for $1 billion plus for the year.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. And then just lastly for Steve on the grid business, Chinese competitors have made very big inroads there, even on areas like HVDC is the last decade. How confident are you about the ability to bring up the grid margins given the competitive landscape is so different now?","Steve Bolze","","I think what you saw from the results in the quarter is that team is making progress. And one of the thing that business also needs long-term is scale. And that\u2019s one of the things we talked about with Alstom in our integration planning. One of the joint ventures we have is right in that space. We will be putting our digital energy business with the Alstom grid business to have more scale globally and be able to compete with the people like ABB and Siemens. So I think we are on the right track.","Jeff Immelt","","Julian, if you look in the industry ABB is 15 plus, Siemens is double digits, our combined business will be 5% to 6%. If we can get from 5%-6% to 10%, we are going to create a bunch of shareholder value here in terms of where we need to go. And I think that\u2019s our game plan in terms of how do you be a more competitive enterprise on a combined basis.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great, thank you.","Jeff Immelt","","Thanks.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","","Yes, just a quick question on Synchrony. Obviously you are pushing the button today on the road show but once that IPOs what happens to the accounting for the retail funds business; does that move as an investment or does it qualify for discontinuation?","Jeff Bornstein","","No, will continue accounting for it and continue our operations and we'll account for the public ownership, roughly 15% as minority interest.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. No, that's very clear. And then just switching to the H; you\u2019ve got nine units in your order book. And I'm just wondering Jeff, you mentioned that EPG that's I think roughly 35% on the proposal, I'm just wondering how that number\u2019s changed?","Steve Bolze","The H, just to follow up on your question there Nigel, as we said we have nine now in the process and our first one ship next year and the demand is around the world and you see demand also in this high efficiency segment continuing to move forward, a lot of focus on area; there are multiple people in the space, but we are happy with our progress. And as you heard from Jeff Bornstein, if you look at our gas turbine orders through the first half, we're 41 versus 32 last year. We're making headway towards the framework that we put out earlier this year of about 125 for the year.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","How many in the bid cycle?","Steve Bolze","In the bid cycle, H probably north of 45, 50. So there is a lot of activity around the world. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Hey. Just a couple of kind of deal related questions. First just Steve or perhaps Jeff Bornstein, but the JV structure and the put structure as it relates to that at Alstom, can you give us a little more color on how that works and how this floor mechanism works?","Steve Bolze","Absolutely Jeff I, the mechanics, two different structures but it's clear on how Alstom gets liquidity. And in each case, Alstom would have the right to sell all of its shares in the JVs to GE at a price that would return Alstom\u2019s investment plus an annual accretion in line approximately to our borrowing costs. Additionally there is an opportunity for Alstom to share and some potential upside based on a predetermined EBITDA multiple. The timing of those outputs are slightly different grid and renewables more in the three to four year timeframe for the [nuclear] and French steam JV more in the year 5, 6, 7 timeframe but it\u2019s clear we know how it works and pretty straight forward.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","If those things go [south part] you still own that making them hold at their investment plus some accretion?","Steve Bolze","That\u2019s correct. In terms of their whole and some slightly return as we talked about. But at this point we maintain operational control. We named the CEO and we know how to get after the synergies.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","And then I was also just wondering shifting gears on Synchrony. I was a little surprised to hear late 2015 is kind of the split-off target given that looks like you\u2019re getting this done mid \u201814 I would have thought maybe six, nine months of seasoning would have been enough and this would be kind of an early \u201815 split. Can you share any thought or philosophy on that?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. So we\u2019re on the timeline we talked about for the IPO. We\u2019re talking in the second half of \u201815 now. I think just based on the amount of work to get the standalone ready and to get to where we need to be with regulators and get to the approval process. We think that\u2019s probably closer to the second half of \u201815.","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, Jeff, we\u2019re not going to keep it a day longer than when we get approval to do the split. So it\u2019s just really letting it season as all we\u2019re trying to just allow for a little timeframe for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. So Alstom, back to Alstom. When do we get a full handle on the EPC liability risks that project death and life? And as the crawlery just to wait until the deal closes to communicate that if there is something that could be material that you might have to true up or top-up with GE Funding?","Jeff Bornstein","Why don\u2019t I step in on that one John. Listen, there is nothing new to report here today, you're talking I think about turnkey projects that they have. We get public company due diligence, so there is a certain amount of detail that we have got the exposure to. And with that, we've accounted for that in our financial model, but there is always going to be things we find as we go through the process. But I say at this point, this is a business we know well, we factored that in and we have some synergies to offset as we go forward. So at this point, we just got, we think we got to come.","Jeff Immelt","John I would just add that and say really a business in an industry that we've been in for 100 years. We've done at once with Alstom, so we knew a little bit from 1999. Deals like this come around infrequently particularly at this kind of valuation, so 4.5 times EBITDA after synergies and synergy pipeline that adds up to more than 1.2 billion. So there is always a lot of discussion around deals like this, but the overall economics are extremely compelling for investors in light in our sweet spot vis-\u00e0-vis the ability to execute.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Steve.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So just at a high level first and I have a follow up on power and water mix, what offsets the healthcare revision in framework?","Jeff Bornstein","","Well we generally expect the businesses within the framework I just shared with you in December to be within that framework and.","Jeff Immelt","","I think Steve aviation is certainly doing better and oil and gas is off to a good start for the year and we expect energy management to deliver\u2026","Jeff Bornstein","","Across the portfolio we think we are still within framework we have shared with you.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay and then just on power and water I guess this kind of goes to the next question. When you look out to the second half I think you have the thermal deliveries are going to be up, it looks like distributed power faces pretty much tougher comps and the orders aren\u2019t holding up there so maybe that\u2019s a little bit lower. How much better or against Advanced Gas Paths going to be in the second half and is that enough to offset what would seem like ongoing negative mix when you look at thermal being up and distributed power being down?","Steve Bolze","","Steve as we look at Advanced Gas Paths we have got 19 shifts in the quarter, 36 year-to-date versus 14 last year. So we are clearly on a better path this year on Advanced Gas Paths. My guess is as we look at the second half of the year we are going to see the second half kind of more level loaded with the first half so therefore it might be 70ish maybe a little more. So that\u2019s why when Jeff Bornstein talked about Advanced Gas Paths we feel little better but we do have some probably some softness in the distributed power area. So that\u2019s how we, kind of how we look at that.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So to-date, I think you've announced dispositions of roughly a little over $1 billion; you think you've got a targeted number of $4 billion. I was just wondering, if you could give us any update on the timing there? And Jeff, you made a comment earlier that you like where your portfolio is today on oil and gas, so I was wondering what areas you would be looking at specifically to add across your industrial portfolio?","Jeff Immelt","Well Joe, again, I think we never like to talk about dispositions and so we actually see them, but I would say we are on track for the $4 billion and we would expect additional announcements as you look at how the year unfolds, but those things happen as they happen.","And on the buy side, look we always have a list of stuff that we do. I think the question that Scott asked earlier was really a more along the lines of Turbomachinery and packaging and things like that. We feel like in oil and gas, we feel like we've got a great portfolio in that particular segment of oil and gas. And I would just circle back to the big priority of the team really is the Alstom integration and that's where the main focus is right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Hey. Jeff, in your opening remarks, you touched on there were some push outs and you said wind, oil and gas, and subsea. And I was hoping you could quantify a bit as to what the size of those or maybe by geographies any reasons and is this project timing or customer confidence?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes Deane, I\u2019ll give you a few pieces of it. So within power and water and wind, we had 400, 500 wind units that moved out of the quarter really just awaiting clarification from the treasury department on what constitutes start of construction to be eligible for PTC and these are projects that evolve bank financing and tax equity investors. So, very tough to move those projects along until we\u2019re absolutely certain that they\u2019re going to qualify for the PTC. We expect that clarification to come from the treasury in the next week or two. And we\u2019ve seen that clarification and we think it\u2019s helpful. So, that\u2019s one example, that\u2019s over a $1 billion of orders. And then in subsea, we have a couple of big projects. Of course that we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see here certainly in the second half as soon as possible would be great, that\u2019s well over a $1 billion as well. ","Jeff Immelt","Deane, on this, there is I think three big subsea deals, two of them have been awarded us, so it\u2019s just a function of getting the kind of project approval and stuff like that.","Jeff Bornstein","We\u2019re waiting for financial close\u2026","Jeff Immelt","We\u2019re just waiting for financial close to put the order.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Yes, good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Good morning, yes. Just with Alstom and with Synchrony, and also you guys are going to do divestitures. What is the rest that some of the restructuring actions get pushed back with active portfolio reshaping going on, just thinking about management bandwidth this year?","Jeff Bornstein","Zero.","Jeff Immelt","Andrew I just think zero. Our intent is to get to the 75-25 by \u201816 and still do the simplification that we\u2019ve got going right now and the teams are executing along that track.","Jeff Bornstein","I would just add Andrew, as long as we\u2019ve got a project list it looks like year and half pay backs, those returns on investment are incredible and we will do every one of them.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, good morning. Thanks for putting me in. I appreciate the transparency and speed that which you are moving through this. Couple of questions here, the first one, just clarification on GE Capital. The $3 billion of dividend; how much specials in there?","Jeff Bornstein","We're estimating a $2 billion income dividend and about a $1 billion special.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And is there any room for movement around that special in your view, up or down?","Jeff Bornstein","Not likely.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, alright. And then Steve, and so I\u2019ve got you on power gen. What -- we look at the thermal rate which is also lumpy and down again this quarter but what headwinds are you starting to see or anticipate in the future on the distributed generation and roof top solar front versus the impact on power gen and you've got energy efficiency, you've got solar finally making inroads? Are you guys thinking about that as a headwind at all to growth in the core area?","Jeff Immelt","Steve?","Steve Bolze","I think it's a great question. I'd say you are seeing the impact of less load growth, electricity load growth, because of the distributed generation technology, solar energy storage et cetera. But what I would say is in aggregate though there is still electricity load growth. And again, a lot of those technologies still are less than 1% or 2% of the total load on the system and still 70% of all new power generation, new equipment purchases in the world are in developing regions. So this is something we got to look at on a global scale. So overall, I'd say we play in pieces of that. And I think you'll see us over time build out the portfolio in spaces but\u2026","Jeff Immelt","","In the DP businesses, Algeria, Brazil, Thailand, those aren\u2019t solar places, that\u2019s where the DP business really goes.","Steve Bolze","","Right. So, I would say overall it\u2019s an opportunity for us and we go from there.","Matt Cribbins","","Okay, great. We\u2019re bumping up against 09:30. The replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We\u2019ll also be distributing our quarterly supplemental data for GE Capital later today.

","Our industrial earnings growth was up 12%, with six of seven segments growing. Capital earned $2.5 billion, including some tax-efficient gains as we exited global platforms. And we were able to pull forward $0.05 of industrial restructuring, partially offset by $0.03 of gain, so this is more than we expected and will give us some more cost out in 2014. ","We continue to run the company well. Margins grew by 100 basis points in the quarter and 60 basis points for the year. This actually reflects 66 basis points before the impact of acquisitions. Our value gap was exceptionally strong and we reduced structural cost by $1.6 billion for the year. We generated $17.4 billion of CFOA in India, with $89 billion of consolidated cash. ","We allocated accounts in a value-creating way. We returned $18.2 billion through dividends and buyback. We completed $9 billion of M&A, primarily in oil and gas and aviation, and these businesses are delivering for investors. So overall, this was a good quarter for GE, and positions us to deliver in 2014 and beyond.","Our earnings for the quarter were about $31 billion, a record. We also ended the year with a record high backlog of $244 billion. We had growth in both equipment and services. There was real strength in power and water. We ended the year with 125 orders for heavy duty gas turbines. Power gen services grew by 9%, which was actually 16% excluding Europe. And recently, our gains were broad-based. The U.S. continued to rebound, growing 8%. For the total year, orders grew by 8%, and backlog grew by $34 billion.","Aviation orders reflect our record backlog for equipment, but at the same time aviation services continues to be very strong. Orders for oil and gas equipment are always lumpy, but orders year to date are up 8%, and we\u2019re encouraged by the orders\u2019 price performance in oil and gas. We built a big backlog in energy management, which should help in 2014. And transportation is being impacted by a weak mining market. ","Orders pricing was in line with our expectations. We saw pricing pressure in heavy-duty gas turbines, mainly based on regional mix. But on balance, we expect to continue to drive a positive value gap in 2014.","Our growth initiatives continue to deliver results. Growth market revenue was up 10% in the quarter. Growth was pretty broad-based. Six of nine regions were up by double digits. And we continue to build out our growth market presence.","For service, 6% revenue growth was the best quarterly result in 2013. Highlights include 54 advanced gas paths. Aviation spares grew by 17%. The oil and gas services grew by 17%. We launched another 14 productivity offerings in the fourth quarter. And our dollars per installed base grew by 5% in the quarter.","We continue to win in the market. The Dubai Airshow resulted in $40 billion of wins. The Revolution CT is rapidly becoming the industry standard. We\u2019re the only locomotive competitor, with both a tier four diesel and an LNG offering in test, and we continue to build out service technology in the oil and gas installed base.","At our outlook meeting, we set a target of 4% to 7% organic growth for 2014. And with the huge backlog and strong growth initiatives, that looks achievable.","For margins, we have a pretty good story on margins, growing 100 basis points in the quarter. We finished the year up 66 basis points on an organic basis. We had an internal plan that was well above 70 basis points, but we were impacted by supply chain quality issues [in wind] and some energy management project delays.","By business, we had positive operating leverage year over year and margin expansion in six of seven businesses. Big drivers of our margin expansion were simplification and value gap. In 2013 we achieved $1.6 billion of simplification benefits and our value gap was about $900 million.","In addition, we were able to do more fourth quarter restructuring, which will fortify our margin goals in 2014. One other note, we had no gains in the fourth quarter of \u201913 versus some gains in the fourth quarter of \u201912. So this really was solid performance.","We\u2019re getting fairly consistent margin performance across the company, and with margins expanding 110 basis points in the second half, we really feel like we have good momentum going into 2014.","So on to 2014. We plan to grow margins in 2014 in line with our goal to exceed 17% by 2016. And we pulled forward more restructuring in \u201913 than we originally planned. In the fourth quarter of \u201913, we executed $0.05 per share of projects that have an 18-month payback. This was partially offset by $0.03 of gains.","We finished 2013 with $1.6 billion of structural cost out. Because of our fourth quarter restructuring, we\u2019re increasing our cost out goals for 2014. At the outlook meeting, we said we would achieve about $1 billion of cost out. We\u2019re now targeting to get more than $1 billion. And we expect our SG&A as a percentage of revenue to be about 14% in \u201914. ","Key margin drivers will again be value gap and simplification. We expect R&D to be better and mix will be negative as our product sales are growing faster than service. But our margin plans have been fortified, and this should be a tailwind for GE going into 2014.","Look, we ended the quarter with significant balance sheet strength. Our total CFOA was about $17.5 billion for the year, consistent with expectations. We had a good quarter in capital efficiency and working capital. ","On the GE Capital side, we have substantial liquidity. Our commercial paper fell below $30 billion for the first time in many, many years. And we ended the year with $89 billion of consolidated cash and about $14 billion at the parent. ","We\u2019re implementing our plans of value creation and opportunistic and balanced capital allocation. In 2013, we returned $18.2 billion to investors through dividends and buyback. And we announced a 16% increase in our dividend at year-end. ","And like I said earlier, we completed $9 billion of acquisitions. As I said at the outlook meeting, we plan to work capital efficiency hard in 2014, and our capital allocation will create value for our investors. ","So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff to talk about the operations and performance of the businesses. ","Jeff Bornstein ","Great, thank you. So I\u2019ll start with consolidated results. We had continuing operations revenue of $40.4 billion, reported up 3% in the quarter, industrial sales of $28.8 billion were up 6%, and GE Capital revenues were up $11.1 billion, down 5%. ","Operating earnings of $5.4 billion were up 16%, and operating earnings per share of $0.53 were up 20%. Continuing EPS of $0.49, which includes the impact of nonoperating pension, and net earnings per share of $0.41 includes the impact of discontinued operations, which I\u2019ll cover on the next page.","As Jeff says, total year CFOA was $14.3 billion. When you add back the $3.2 billion of NBC tax impact, you get to $17.5 billion. We had solid industrial performance this year, with the variance to 2012 driven by the NBCU related taxes, as I mentioned.","We received $2 billion of dividends from GE Capital in the quarter. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 19%, which is in line with the framework we provided earlier in the year, and the total year rate was also 19%.","The GE Capital tax rate was significantly negative in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by the tax efficient sale of our Swiss platform, which resulted in about $1 billion of tax benefits in the quarter. This drove a negative 77% tax rate in the quarter, and for the year GE Capital\u2019s tax rate was a negative 14%. ","On the right side, you can see the segment results, with total industrial segment profit up 12% and six of seven businesses contributing to earnings growth. GE Capital earnings also grew in the quarter, up 38%. And I\u2019ll take you through the dynamics of each of the segments on the following pages, but overall, a reasonably strong quarter. ","On the other items page, first we had $0.03 of gains related to industrial transactions. We disposed of air filtration within our power and water business, the Vital Signs business within healthcare, and the advanced sensors business within oil and gas. All three of these gains were booked in corporate.","We had $0.05 of charges in the quarter related to restructuring and other items. This was about $0.02 higher than we had planned, as we continue to invest in restructuring to rightsize the industrial cost structure and position the company for 2014 and beyond. ","In discontinued operations, we had $787 million in after tax impacts in the quarter, really driven by four items. First, we booked $442 million of additional reserves on Grey Zone. While we saw claims decline in the third quarter, claims in the fourth quarter are above our model expectations. So we revised our assumption to reflect a further slowing in the overall claims reduction rate. We ended the quarter with $859 million in reserves. ","On WMC, pending claims declined from $6.3 billion in the third quarter to $5.6 billion at the end of the year, as the team settled about $1 billion of pending claims. That was partially offset by new pending claims of $281 million.","We recorded a $116 million charge resulting in the total reserve balance at the end of the year of $800 million, and that\u2019s flat with where we ended the third quarter.","Also in the quarter we signed an agreement to sell our consumer bank in Russia, resulting in a $170 million loss in discontinued ops, principally FX-related. And we expect to complete the transaction in the first quarter, and this will lower our E&I by almost $1 billion.","Lastly, we had a [unintelligible] tax adjustment related to plastics of $65 million on disallowment of interest reductions from years previous.","So on an operating basis, we had $0.02 higher industrial restructuring versus gains, which was about $300 million on a pretax basis. It\u2019s the main driver of our higher corporate expense in the quarter.","Now I\u2019ll go through each of the segments, starting with power and water. Orders of $10.3 billion were up 44%, our largest orders quarter in the last five years. Excluding Europe, orders were actually up 56%.","Equipment orders of $6.4 billion were up 81%, driven by thermal and wind. Thermal orders were up three times, driven by the Algerian deal and strength in Saudi and Latin America. Excluding Algeria, thermal orders were still up over 100%. We had orders for 65 gas turbines in the fourth quarter versus 26 last year, and that brought the total year to 124 units on order. Backlog for thermal was up 70% for the year.","Wind orders were up 63%. We had orders for 779 wind turbines versus 412 in the fourth quarter of \u201912, principally driven by U.S. demand. And wind backlog was up 43% for the year. Service orders of $3.9 billion were up 8%, primarily driven by PGS, up 9%, and up 16% ex Europe. ","And we were very strong in AGPs. We did 25 AGPs in the quarter versus 6 in the previous year. Total [unintelligible] price was lower, as Jeff said, at 3%, with thermal down 4% and wind down 5%. ","Revenue in the quarter was $7.7 billion. That was flat with last year. Thermal revenue was down 11% as we shipped 28 gas turbines versus 32 in the fourth quarter of \u201912. That was partially offset by wind up 6%, with shipment of 875 turbines versus 722 a year ago.","We recognized the revenue on 200 fewer wind turbines than we had planned, primarily due to a supply chain quality issue and project delays and customer delays. The impact on the quarter was approximately $500 million of revenue, and including the reserves for the quality issues, about $100 million of margin.","As we work through the quarter here, we had some blade issues in November. The team was all over it. We spent an enormous amount of time within the supply chain understanding the blade issue. ","We spent most of December understanding what the fleet impact would be and what the manufacturing anomalies associated with it were, and it was really not until around Christmastime that we realized that we probably weren\u2019t going to [rev req] a lot of these turbines that potentially could have an issue with the blade.","Service revenues of $3.8 billion were up 3%, up 8% ex Europe. On segment profit, $1.9 billion was up 9%, driven primarily by value gap. The power and water team has also done an exceptional job on cost, with SG&A in the quarter down 18% and down 13% for the year. Margins improved 190 basis points year over year in the fourth quarter.","Overall, based on 2013 orders, we\u2019re seeing a gradual improvement in heavy duty gas turbines and wind will also have a strong year in 2014. With these higher deliveries, coupled with simplification benefits, we expect power and water to grow earnings in 2014. Based on our backlog, we do expect deliveries to ramp through the year similar to 2013.","Additionally, we\u2019re continuing to work through the blade supply issues in wind. And it could have a moderate impact on the first quarter, but it in no way changes our outlook for 2014 for the business or the wind business.","Next is oil and gas. Orders of $5.5 billion were down 2%, with equipment orders down 8%. Subsea orders were down 10% and drilling and surface was down 20% on tough comparisons to last year. That was partially offset by M&C, up 8%.","For the year, equipment orders were up 12% and backlog grew 27%. Service orders were up 6%, led by global service, up 8%, partially offset by M&C, down 3%. Service backlog grew 27% in services as well.","Orders pricing was strong in the quarter, up 1.8%. Operations in the business had a solid quarter. Revenue for $5.3 billion was up 17%, that\u2019s up 9% after acquisitions. Equipment revenues of $2.8 billion were higher by 16%, driven by strong execution in subsea, up 70%, drilling and service, up 20%, partially offset by M&C, down 18% on continued market softness.","Service revenues of $2.5 billion were up 17% with strength in global services, up 9%, drilling and surface up 20%, and subsea up 45%. Segment profit grew 24% to $800 million, up 18% after acquisitions, driven by strong value gap and higher volume. Margins were up 80 basis points year over year, and they were up 120 basis points year over year excluding acquisitions. ","Next I\u2019ll walk through aviation and healthcare. Aviation, orders of $7 billion were down 5%, driven by equipment orders down 15%. Commercial engine orders were $3.2 billion, down 12%, primarily driven by the huge ramp of CFM LEAP orders starting in the fourth quarter of \u201912. CFM orders were down 23% in the quarter to $1.5 billion.","GEnx orders of $1 billion were up 21%, and GE90 orders were up 43% in the quarter. Commercial engines backlog grew 28% to $21.6 billion, despite not yet booking the vast majority of the $23 billion plus of energy commitments from the Dubai Airshow.","Military engine orders were down 43% as we expected, so as we look ahead into 2014 for the military business, we\u2019re expecting profits to be down mid-single digits year over year. Service orders of $3 billion were up 11%, driven by commercial spares, up 16%, to $26 million a day. Military service orders were down 3%, driven by sequestration and lower flying hours, which are down 15% to 20% over the last 12 months.","Service backlog ended the year at $97 billion, 22% higher than year-end 2012. Orders pricing was strong, with positive 1.8%. Revenue in the quarter of $6.2 billion was up 13%, up 7% ex Avio. The commercial equipment revenue was 17% higher with 627 unit deliveries versus 589 in 4Q of \u201912 and a greater mix of higher value GEnx and GE90 engines.","We shipped 80 GEnx engines in the quarter. The military revenues were up 16% on lower units, 239 versus 258, but the value was higher, driven by favorable mix of tankers and fighter engines. ","Service revenues were up 10%, driven by strong spares revenue, up 17% to $26.4 million a day. And military service was down 17%, driven in part by sequestration and the lower flying hours, in addition to the wind down of some upgrade programs. ","Operating profit of $1.25 billion was up 20%, up 13% ex Avio, on strong volume and value gap. Margin rates improved 130 basis points, 100 basis points ex Avio. Strong cost productivity more than offset GEnx mix and higher R&D spend, and also if you exclude the Duarte disposition from the fourth quarter of \u201912, margins would have been up 310 basis points in the quarter. So overall, a very strong quarter and a strong year for the aviation team. ","Healthcare orders of $5.4 billion were up 1%, driven by emerging markets up 4%, with Latin America up 15% and China up 8%, partially offset by Russia, down 19%. From a developed markets perspective, the U.S. was flat, Europe was up 2%, Japan was down 10%, but actually up 11% excluding the impact of FX.","Equipment orders of $3.4 billion were down 1%. CT was down 16%, MR was up 1%, ultrasound was down 2%, and molecular imaging was up 6%. Service orders of $2.1 billion were up 3%, driven by healthcare IT, up 6%. Healthcare IT growth has picked up as new product launches are gaining traction. And as Jeff said at the December outlook meeting, we expect healthcare IT to be up 10% organically in 2014.","Revenue of $5.1 billion was down 1%. That\u2019s flat excluding the effects of FX. And fourth quarter profit of $1.1 billion was up 4%, as the benefits of simplification more than offset the impact of lower price and foreign exchange.","SG&A was down 13% in the quarter, and down 6% for the year. Margin rates were up 110 basis points. Excluding the impact of the Thomas Medical disposition in the fourth quarter of \u201912, our profit would have been up 13%, with margins expanding 230 basis points.","Next I\u2019ll cover transportation. Orders of $1.2 billion were down 9%. Equipment orders were down 2%, and we had orders for 149 locos versus 88 in the fourth quarter of \u201912. But mining orders continue to be soft, down 60%. Service orders were down 15%, driven by flat service contracts, but offset by fewer modifications and weak demand for mining parts.","Revenues of $1.5 billion were up 7% year over year. Strong equipment growth of 22% was offset by service revenue down 8%, again driven by soft mining parts. Locomotive shipments were higher, with fourth quarter deliveries of 171 units compared with 117 a year ago.","Operating profit of $280 million was up 11%, with margins better by 70 basis points. And the improvement was principally driven by positive value gap. In 2013, transportation executed well in a difficult environment, expanding margins 140 basis points. ","Looking into 2014, we expect a continuing soft mining industry with OHB shipments down 50% for the year. And the first quarter will be weaker than that, probably down closer to 80%. We expect a slow recovery for North American coal offset somewhat by strong international pipeline for locos.","Performance in our energy management business has been disappointing this year. Although results were modestly better sequentially, they were still well below the business\u2019 potential.","Orders continue to be a good story, up 6% in the quarter to $2.3 billion, a record for the business. This was driven by power conversion, up 18% on strong renewables industry volume, offset partially by industrial solutions, down 6%.","2013 backlog was up 20%, with every single platform in the business being higher. Revenues were up 4%, principally driven by industrial solutions and intelligent platforms. Operating profit of $46 million was down 28%, driven by power conversion. ","This business has continued to deal with backlog conversion challenges and higher setup costs as they began production of our new marine platform. Over the last few years, the marine business has more than doubled its backlog, and total power conversion has grown backlog by 35%. We expect to see steady progress in power conversion throughout 2014 as their volume ramps and they focus on converting this backlog.","Despite the poor performance in energy management this quarter, we do think we are making progress in our restructuring efforts and our execution issues. For instance, our industrial solutions business that we started restructuring two years ago was up 71% in op profit in the quarter. It was up 38% for the year on op profit, on almost flat volume. So more work to do here, but also some good execution within our industrial solutions business. ","Appliances and lighting had a good quarter, primarily driven by appliances. Overall, the appliance domestic industry was up 10% on units, with strength in both retail, up 10%, and contract, up 12%. Housing starts continue to be positive. They were up 16%, with single family better by 13% and multifamily up 22%. ","Revenues of $2.2 billion were higher by 6%, led by a 9% increase in appliances. Lighting revenues were up 1%, with strong global LED sales, which were up 50%, offset by continued decline in our incandescent product lines.","Segment profit of $142 million was up 23%. Appliances op profit was up 51%, driven by positive value gap and productivity, and lighting op profit was higher by 5%. Margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter for the segment.","Next I\u2019m going to go through GE Capital. Before I go through the standard operating page, I thought I\u2019d take you through a layout of some of the major items in the quarter, similar to the way Keith did it in the November meeting.","So if you start on the left here, GE Capital earned $2.5 billion, up 38% from a year ago. On the right side, you can see we had $1.6 billion of tax benefits and gains from the Switzerland and the BAY transactions as we discussed. We sold 68.5% share in the Swiss consumer bank via an IPO, resulting in $1.2 billion of tax benefits and gains. In addition, we completed the sale of our remaining stake in Bay Bank, resulting in a $400 million gain. ","As the team continues to reposition the portfolio, we did have $1 billion of charges related to dispositions and restructuring of noncore consumer and real estate assets as well as impairments in CLL and GECAS. And I\u2019ll cover some of the principal drivers here.","In the consumer segment, we exited $700 million of mortgage assets in the Netherlands at a loss of $75 million. And we recorded an impairment charge of $90 million on an investment in a Taiwanese bank that positions us to exit that noncore asset in 2014.","In real estate, we had a $75 million charge related to the sell down of the equity book in our Swedish portfolio. In CLL, we recorded an after-tax impairment of $290 million related to two specific investments as well as a small writedown in our corporate asset book.","And in GECAS, we recorded impairments of $270 million, primarily related to certain older aircraft types that are more susceptible to changes in technology and operator preferences, which reduces our exposure to these less desirable assets and creates additional portfolio flexibility. And I\u2019ll cover more of these items as I go through each of the segments on the following page.","Finally, we had adjustments to reserving models, primarily in North America retail finance and consumer international, resulting in $200 million in higher after-tax credit costs in the quarter. In retail, we increased our loss reserve coverage in 12 months to 12.5 months of forecasted chargeoffs. And after adjusting for all these items, GE Capital\u2019s net income in the quarter was $2.1 billion. ","Now to cover operations in the segments, revenue of $11.1 billion was down 5%, with assets down 4% or $22 billion year over year. Net income of $2.5 billion was up 38% from prior year as the tax benefits and gains, as I mentioned, from the Swiss and BAY transactions, more than offset portfolio actions, higher losses and impairments, and lower assets.","We ended the quarter with $380 billion of ENI. That\u2019s down $36 billion or 9% from last year, and down $3 billion sequentially. Noncore ENI was down 22% to $53 billion. Net interest margins in the quarter increased 16 basis points to 5%, and flat with the third quarter. Volume was up 5% in the quarter, with new business ROIs over 2%, as we continue to stay disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles.","Tier one common on a Basel I basis improved by 10 basis points sequentially and 120 basis points year over year to 11.4%, driven by the reduction in assets and after paying $2 billion of dividends in the quarter.","For total year 2013, GE Capital paid $6 billion in dividends at the parent and will pay an additional $130 million in the first quarter to reflect the higher fourth quarter earnings.","On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be strong, with delinquency rates improving across the portfolio. We ended the quarter with $29 billion of commercial paper, ahead of our plans, and liquidity was very strong, ending the quarter at $75 billion.","Now I\u2019ll walk through each of the segments. The commercial lending and leasing business ended the fourth quarter with $74 billion of assets - that\u2019s down 4% from last year - including a reduction in noncore assets of $3 billion. On book core volume was $13 billion, down 8%, due to the elevated level of customer activity we saw last year from the U.S. fiscal cliff concerns. ","But we did see strong volume growth in the U.S. direct mid-market businesses, which were up 32% in the quarter versus 2012. Overall, new business returns remained attractive at about 2% ROIs, despite continued excess liquidity. These are positive growth indicators as we think about our core CLL business going into next year.","Earnings of $263 million were down 52%, driven by lower assets and impairments. After adjusting for impairments that I covered on the prior page, earnings would have been up 1% with assets down 4%. Asset quality was stable in the portfolio. In 2013, the CLL business earned $2 billion, and going into \u201914, we expect it to be up double digits. ","The consumer segment ended the quarter with $132 billion of assets. That\u2019s down 4% from last year. The Swiss and BAY deals we exited reduced assets by $5 billion. Net income of $2.1 billion was up almost three times, again driven by these two transactions, partially offset by higher credit costs and charges related to the portfolio actions that I talked about on the prior page.","North American retail finance earned $466 million in the fourth quarter - that\u2019s down 2% - as higher core net income was offset by reserve adjustments and continued marketing investments. Asset growth in the business was strong at 10%, driven by volume up 11%. Overall, consumer asset quality remained stable.","Real estate had another decent quarter. Assets ended the quarter at $39 billion. That\u2019s down 16%, down $1 billion sequentially. The equity book is down 32% from a year ago to $14 billion. Net income of $128 million was down 59% versus 2012, but in line with where we expected them to be. That was driven by nonrepeat of last year\u2019s gain from the sale of our business properties portfolio of about $82 million and our Sweden equity sell down, at about $75 million.","In the quarter we sold 341 properties with a book value of about $2.4 billion for $145 million in gains. The debt business earned over $100 million in the quarter and originated $4.7 billion of volume at attractive returns, including the purchase of a $1.8 billion U.K. portfolio from Deutsche Postbank.","Asset quality continues to improve, with 30-day delinquencies at 124 basis points. And that\u2019s the lowest level we\u2019ve seen since the crisis. The real estate team earned $1.7 billion in 2013, and continues to execute well as they shrink the equity book and invest in a profitable debt business. In \u201914, we expect the business to have lower earnings, as we\u2019ve shared with you, with the debt business performing well, offset by lower gains and tax benefits.","Within the verticals, GECAS earned $71 million. That\u2019s down 79%, driven by impairments of $270 million, which were up roughly $230 million from prior year. As I mentioned on the prior page, we revised our expectations for certain older aircraft types in our portfolio. We lowered our estimate of future cash flows on these aircraft to reflect a shorter useful life and lower residual values. ","As a result, we had impairments related to old and narrow bodies of about $130 million, cargo aircraft of $50 million, and $32 million on 50-seat regional jets. The average age of the aircraft we impaired in the quarter was 15 years compared to our fleet average of about 7 years. GECAS did end the quarter with zero delinquencies and no aircraft on the ground. For the total year 2013, GECAS earned $900 million, and in \u201914 we expect them to be up double digits. ","EFS earnings were up 95 in the quarter to $117 million, driven largely by lower margin impairments year over year. We had several large items in the quarter. As we continue to reposition the portfolio, the capital team continues to execute well and deliver strong operating results. In \u201913, the business earned $8.3 billion, up 12%, on $36 billion lower E&I.","Capital liquidity and funding are all very strong and we continue to be disciplined around the volume that we\u2019re originating. In \u201914, we expect GE Capital to earn roughly $7 billion on core growth, offset by lower gains, tax benefits, and the impact of our anticipated retail finance IPO.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff. ","Jeff Immelt ","Great, Jeff. Thanks. Again, just to recap on \u201913, we had a good year in \u201913. Industrially, our segment profits grew by 12% in the second half and then we had five of seven segments that had strong growth for the year. We grew margins by 66 basis points organically, close to our 70 basis point goal.","Organic growth was flat but up 5% ex power and water. Capital had a solid year, with earnings up 12% while shrinking E&I by 9%. And they paid a dividend of $6 billion to the parent. Per our plan, we returned $18.2 billion of cash to investors through dividends and buybacks. ","So we hit really most of our goals for 2013. And then looking forward, on the 2014 framework, we have no change for the 2014 operating framework. We expect double digit industrial earnings growth similar to the second half of \u201913. We expect 4% to 7% organic growth with expanded margins. ","GE Capital has about $7 billion of earnings, reflecting an improving origination environment, the North American retail transaction, and lower real estate gains. Corporate should be slightly more positive as we pulled forward restructuring into 2013. And there\u2019s no change in our outlook for cash or revenue.","So we end the year with momentum. I think we presented this framework to you in December, and I would say, based on the way we closed the year, we\u2019re quite confident in this operating framework for 2014. So we feel good about the momentum of the company.","So Trevor, with that, let\u2019s turn it back to you and take some questions. ","Trevor Schauenberg ","Great. Thanks, Jeff and Jeff. Operator, let\u2019s open up the phone lines for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays ","Early in the call, Jeff, you mentioned having greater confidence in the structural cost out. Can you talk about your confidence in value gap? Price looked a little light, particularly in power and water. Do you have a greater confidence in value gap in 2014, or the same? Or lower?","Jeff Immelt ","What I would say is the value gap was about $900 million in \u201913. Our expectation is that it\u2019s not that strong. It\u2019s probably more in the couple hundred million dollar range. When we look at the backlog and where we\u2019ve gone from a sourcing standpoint, we feel confident in the value gap still being a tailwind in 2014. ","If you just go a layer lower and you look at gas turbine equipment margin, operating profit, it\u2019s going to be positive in \u201914 versus \u201913. So that\u2019s the one that\u2019s probably had the most intense pricing pressure. But we\u2019ve had a very active plan to get about 10% of the costs out of our heavy duty gas turbine product. And that\u2019s going to bleed through. ","So just to pick the one where we\u2019ve had the most intense competition, we see positive earnings growth year over year in \u201914 versus \u201913 on heavy duty gas turbine operating profit dollars. ","Scott Davis - Barclays ","And then energy management continues to be a bit of a tough spot. Where can that business go? Can it ever be a double digit margin business? Is there an end game? Just trying to figure out what we can expect out of these guys.","Jeff Immelt ","I think it\u2019s a very fair question. I think what Jeff said earlier is we\u2019re going to do a lot of restructuring this year. Every time we sit and review the business, we compare it directly with their industrial peers, all of whom have double digit operating profit rates. That\u2019s our expectation for this business. And investors, and me, should expect substantial improvement in 2014 versus 2013.","Operator","And then the next question will come from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","You guys in the last several quarters have given the year over year change in services margins. I didn\u2019t see it in the slides. Can you maybe just give a little extra color on that, year over year?","Jeff Bornstein ","Service margins year over year were up 190 basis points fourth quarter to fourth quarter. Total year, we were up about 90 basis points, full year \u201913 versus \u201912.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","And then just a couple of followups. On the oil and gas side, what\u2019s your visibility on the orders there? There\u2019s just been a lot of moving parts and mix dynamics at your peers. And the orders have obviously run very hot. Everybody is kind of full from a capacity perspective. How do you see the orders in drilling and surface and subsea playing out over the next year?","Jeff Immelt ","There was one big order for these guys that pushed probably into the first quarter that\u2019s big enough to be a meaningful swinger year over year that should lead to a positive first quarter from an orders standpoint. But to your point, particularly in subsea, we\u2019ve got a strong backlog, pretty high visibility, and so as you know these things are lumpy. So our expectation is that these guys continue to have good, solid orders growth next year, but a push of one big project is meaningful from an orders standpoint.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","","And then just on the distributed power, the aeroderiv shipments I think you had a target this year for 200 something. What do you expect for next year? And where did you finish this year on the aeroderivs?","Jeff Bornstein ","On aeroderivatives next year, we\u2019re going to be more or less in the range of this year. We expect to see potentially a little bit of growth, but it\u2019s not going to be enormous growth. We had a big year this year on aeroderivatives, particularly trailer mounted, so we\u2019re hoping for a small amount of growth. But it\u2019s not going to be enormous.","Jeff Immelt ","We had a boomer this year, and I think next year we\u2019re kind of in the flattish range.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","And I don\u2019t want to get all choked up, but thanks to Trevor for all the years of help and best of luck in his new role. ","Trevor Schauenberg ","I\u2019ll miss you too, Steve. [laughter] ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","Not sure about that, but we\u2019ll talk after. [laughter] ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","As I look at the composition of the margins, on slide six, various puts and takes, what is the big drag in 2014 versus the 66 basis points that we did in 2013, just thinking about it?","Jeff Immelt ","Why don\u2019t I start and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. I think the way we\u2019ve tried to build 2014 is to drive the things we can really control in the environment. So we\u2019re going to have another year that\u2019s going to be very aggressive on the structural cost out. And you guys saw us do well this year. We\u2019re going to have another year of real focus there.","We\u2019re going to have a positive value gap, not as strong as we had this year, but still positive. And I think that\u2019s realistic. So I think simplification is in our control, value gap, we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility. That\u2019s going to be positive. I think R&D we were able to do a little bit more R&D this year. I think that creates a little bit more headroom for us to make sure that R&D is a positive next year for us. ","And then the toughest thing always to call here is mix, in terms of where. So what we\u2019ve tried to do is create a buffer with the things we can control to be able to better balance the mix impact as we go through the year. So we\u2019re not taking our focus off anything. If anything, our structural cost is going to be aggressive. Our restructuring is going to be aggressive. And what we\u2019ve tried to do is create a little bit of buffer vis-\u00e0-vis how mix shakes out in the year.","Jeff Bornstein ","I would just add, on mix, we think equipment is going to be ahead of service next year. And we\u2019ve got a real ramp in GEnx, we\u2019ve got a real ramp in wind. And that\u2019s most of what that mix is driving.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And maybe I missed it, but could you just comment on the order patterns in December? Any big positive or negative surprises versus your expectations other than what happened in wind, obviously?","Jeff Immelt ","In orders, I think power and water was a little bit stronger. We expected a strong fourth quarter, but it was probably even a little bit stronger than what we thought. I think oil and gas, like I said, tends to be a little bit lumpy. Aviation, we\u2019ve got such a big backlog in aviation. I would say the spares number and the service orders are what we watch closely in aviation. I think those were positive. ","Healthcare really no difference in terms of what we thought we were going to see. And I\u2019d say in transportation we just saw weakness around mining, and we expect that to play over into next year. And then the one thing that was really very late-breaking\u2026","Jeff Bornstein ","We had one big oil and gas project in Southeast Asia, almost $700 million, that we were reasonably confident was going to land in the quarter that actually pushed to the first half of next year. Other than that, not a lot of major surprise. As Jeff said, parts and aviation were strong. We expected them to be strong. We knew aviation year over year, based on the CFM launch in the fourth quarter last year, was going to show a little weaker. So I think most everything else was more or less as expected.","Jeff Immelt ","And wind was really not an orders issue.","Jeff Bornstein ","No, we had good wind orders.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Steve Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","I\u2019d like to push that oil and gas question a little bit further. You know, the majors in [petrograph] have all stopped expanding capex. They\u2019ve got numerous projects that are being deferred, [giving cost blowouts], and that\u2019s likely leading to a decline in subsea equipment, at least as we see it, as customers digest their prior orders here. And then we\u2019ve got nominally high crude prices despite that cost inflation that seems to be eroding some of these returns offshore for these guys. So just maybe help us understand this in a little more depth, how you\u2019re going to buck some of that trend. Or do you just disagree with my assertions there? ","Jeff Immelt ","Again, I would say that if you look at most of the big industry contextual comments, even with some of the concern about capex costs and things like that, the forecast is for capex to be positive growth in 2014. Maybe not as great as it was in years gone by, but still pretty great. If you look at the national oil companies versus the integrated oil companies, our view is that the NOCs really haven\u2019t backed off at all. And that\u2019s where we see a ton of activity. ","I\u2019d say the place that we still think is reasonably weak is maybe around North America, some of the drilling and surface stuff. We\u2019re kind of watching that. And then measurement and control stuff, we\u2019re watching that. ","But the last thing I would say, you know, when I get up in the morning, around oil and gas, if you asked me what I worry about first, it\u2019s shipping our late backlog, you know? In other words, we have such a traffic jam around the volume we\u2019ve got in our factories. I\u2019d say we\u2019ve got extremely good visibility, certainly in the short term. You know, again, it\u2019s something we all watch, but I think there\u2019s always going to be big puts and takes in this business. ","But I\u2019d leave you the thought of NOCs versus IOCs, the backlog we have today, and getting it executed, and a long term notion that says, if you pick up any of the big reports that your banks tend to write, you know, they basically say that the long term health of the industry is still pretty strong.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","Yeah, we\u2019re not a bank, but I get it. And that\u2019s helpful. Now, since you mentioned what you think about first thing in the morning, the blade issue for wind, can you identify a little bit more why we shouldn\u2019t have to worry about this happening again, from just an operational standpoint?","Jeff Immelt ","I think this is stuff that comes out of the supply chain. We look at it, we\u2019ve been looking at it for a period of time. I think our teams really feel like we\u2019ve got it isolated and reflected. We\u2019ve got teams that are good at this stuff, and I think we know kind of exactly where we are. ","It may impact a little bit timing, but our read is it\u2019s not going to impact the year at all from the standpoint of either power and water or the power and water segment growth that we\u2019ve got planned for the year, or the wind business revenue growth for the year. ","So we\u2019re good at this stuff, we use an abundance of caution whenever it relates to our customers and things like that, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve exercised here. ","Jeff Bornstein ","I was just going to add, the population we think we\u2019re talking about, it\u2019s one manufacturing batch of blades that we think we\u2019ve isolated it to when we\u2019re doing instructions on nondestructive testing, etc. So the percentage of the fleet we\u2019re talking about is very, very small. And so we\u2019re just trying to isolate this down, and we wanted to be very careful at year-end about how we dealt with it. And we think we\u2019ve got our arms around the issue, and as Jeff said, it will play out here in the first quarter or second quarter of \u201914. ","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","And the $1.6 billion provision number in GE Capital was bigger than I expected, trending from, what, 821 or something last quarter and then bigger last year. And it looks like, as you said, the 30-day delinquencies are getting better. So is this all credit model changes? And do you expect it to stay elevated? Or how should we think about modeling this or anticipate it?","Jeff Bornstein ","It might help if I kind of explain how it moved. Year over year, last year we were at about $1.1 billion, about a $230 million increase in consumer. Now, almost half that increase is associated with selling that Dutch mortgage business in the quarter. Part of the economics of the loss in that actually ran through the provision and then directly to writeoffs. So that, year over year, skews half of it. ","And then I mentioned booking up coverage in the North American retail business from 12 to 12.5 months. And then we had a book up on some restructured consumer accounts in Asia year over year. That\u2019s the bulk of it. On the commercial side, we\u2019re up 175 year over year in provisions, about half of that in real estate and half of that in CLL. ","And some of that was specific reserves around a couple of accounts, but some of it was just hitting reserve floors. So we\u2019ve said we\u2019re not going to go below certain levels of reserve coverage. The portfolio quality of both real estate and CLL would naturally push us below those floors, because things have improved so quickly. And we\u2019re kind of booking back to those floors, which is not going to go through there, and that\u2019s resulting in reprovisioning up with not necessarily direct correlation to what\u2019s happening for me from a portfolio and quality perspective. And that\u2019s most of the change year over year.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","And before I hand it off, I might have missed this, did you guys say what the equivalent to that 66 basis point number would be in your rough expectations for this year, when you put it all together?","Jeff Bornstein ","No, we didn\u2019t say.","Jeff Immelt ","Nice try, Steve. [laughter] ","Jeff Bornstein ","You know, we\u2019ve talked about by the end of 2016 being at 17% plus operating margins, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re defining success, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting. ","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","Just to follow up on Steve\u2019s question, on the 66 margin year over year, could you help bridge where you came short on the 70 basis point target? I know the blade issue you size at $100 million on the margin line, but you also included energy management as one of the margin pressures. So if you could just bridge for us those two items?","Jeff Bornstein ","The wind issue in power would have been diluted to the rate that they printed in the quarter, but it would have been accretive to the overall industrial segment. So that\u2019s a couple of basis points on the total year rate. And combined with energy management, if they had delivered the framework that we expected them to deliver on, we would have been above 71 or 72 basis points for the year. So we\u2019re counting basis points here. The difference between 66 and 70 at this level is $40 million of profit for the year. So we\u2019re really counting small increments here. But ex those two items, we would have been above 70 basis points.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","Good, that\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. And then just a couple of other items. The commercial spares being up 16%, that\u2019s well above global flying hours. What do you attribute the upside to? Is there a restocking going on? Is it easier comp? That looks above expectations.","Jeff Bornstein ","A couple of things. Flying hours are improving pretty dramatically. We\u2019ve been globally north of 5%, and that has a dramatic impact. You also have a little bit of restocking going on. The orders rate is improving, partly because airlines have cut back on the level of inventory they were carrying on spare parts in 2012. And then the fleet has continued to grow, and the fleet is aging, and we\u2019re seeing more instances of overhauls. So the overhaul rate, if you will, on the installed base, is going up. And that\u2019s driving demand for spare parts. So I think it all fits together.","Deane Dray - Citi Research ","And just last question from me, I know you\u2019ve had uncovered restructuring in the quarter here. What\u2019s the expectations for uncovered restructuring? You said $0.10 for 2014. And then specifically, do you have a line of sight on uncovered restructuring in the first quarter?","Jeff Bornstein ","I think what we said was we expected to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in \u201914. We did, as Jeff mentioned, end up accelerating a little bit of that investment into the fourth quarter, largely because the projects were ready to go and we didn\u2019t want to wait to start on execution on those items. ","Overall, that\u2019s money that would have been spent in \u201914 that won\u2019t now, but I still think our range is $1 billion to $1.5 billion. I think there will be other ideas. We talked about doing some restructuring in \u201915. ","So I\u2019m not sure that range is really changing much. I would expect the benefits, as Jeff said, would be slightly better in \u201914 than they otherwise would have been, because we got a little bit of a head start. ","Jeff Immelt ","I think that\u2019s the way I\u2019d think about it. We\u2019ve really fortified the benefits in \u201914, and those should be greater.","Jeff Bornstein ","In terms of the timing on the restructuring, earlier is better than later, and I would expect the bulk of this to happen in the first quarter or certainly the first half of the year.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","Just on GECAS, did you change the useful life on 737s at all? And if not, why not?","Jeff Bornstein ","Here\u2019s what we did. We go through this annual review, you\u2019re very familiar with it. In the third quarter we use third-party data on useful life, residential values, lease rates, etc. We always have some cleanup in the fourth quarter. It usually doesn\u2019t amount to much. ","This year, coming out of the third quarter, the team took a deeper dive on some of our older aircraft, principally narrow body. We\u2019re in a situation now where you\u2019ve got an enormous amount of technology being introduced over the next five to ten years. ","When you get to this level of oil and jet [A] price, the differences in efficiency economically are enormous versus what they might have been historically. And we just decided on both older narrow body Boeing and older narrow body Airbus, that our views of useful lives and residential values were less than what third parties had given us as appraisals in the third quarter. ","And it gives us flexibility to deal with these aircraft, and we think we\u2019re on the right side. We\u2019ll be in the market with some of these aircraft in 2014, and we\u2019ll have an idea of just where we are vis-\u00e0-vis the portfolio. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","Yeah, I just understand, like you\u2019d obviously marked down the older ones first, but if a 37 used to have a useful life of 40 years, and now you\u2019re using 35 - I\u2019m just making up numbers - that actually impacts the whole fleet, regardless of how old the aircraft are in the book. They all come down.","Jeff Bornstein ","This is very specific to 50-seat regional jets, the average age was 15 years, to Airbus A318s, very old 737s. Some of the 737s were in cargo format. Etc., etc. So it\u2019s very much narrow body and deep into their lives aircraft. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a broader implication across the fleet. I think we like the fleet we have. It\u2019s got an average age of 7 years, it\u2019s priced well. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","And just on tax in GE Capital, do you need to start off the year accruing higher because the subpart F has not yet kind of been fixed? How do we actually think about that into the new year?","Jeff Bornstein ","Given our year-end, our fiscal year-end, within GE Capital, etc., the impact for us is really not until the very end of the year. We\u2019re good through the end of November. So the rate we accrue through the year will reflect the fact that we\u2019re in good shape relative to AFE through November and then we\u2019ll assume that in December AFE may not be there, and that\u2019s the rate we\u2019ll accrue to.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","So for a placeholder then, for 2014, what kind of rate should we be using for Capital? ","Jeff Bornstein ","We expect Capital will be single digit tax rate.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","And then just one other one from me. Just kind of back to the margin question, and kind of less the bridge from 66 to 70, but more kind of the bridge from, you know, at the beginning of the year, I think, you saw line of sight as something like 120 or 130, which was giving you confidence in the 70. ","Obviously revenues came in a little lighter. There\u2019s a couple of things that are identifiable in what you\u2019ve put in front of us. But is there anything else that we should be thinking about there that was a problem in \u201913 that doesn\u2019t repeat in \u201914, and along those lines, can you give us an idea of what kind of hedge is in that implicit 40 or so that we\u2019re looking for for \u201914? ","Jeff Immelt ","The one thing I would say is that R&D, with the way the funding ran for aviation, and I would say oil and gas, R&D was a little heavier in \u201913 than I had expected. And again, this is in our control. We\u2019re reasonably confident that R&D is going to be tailwind in \u201914 versus \u201913. So other than that, I think it\u2019s all the puts and takes around mix. But I think we\u2019re pretty confident on that. ","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","And is there a way to frame kind of an internal hedge on 2014?","Jeff Immelt ","I think we\u2019ve got some momentum now, right? So you\u2019ve got a pretty good framework, a pretty good flow, and I think that\u2019s going to carry us over into 2014.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of John Inch of Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Jeff Bornstein, just want to go back to your comments around the fact that you think the bulk of the kind of range of restructuring, the negative restructuring, is sort of first half. Should we just, by inference then, be expecting\u2026 Because GE obviously traditionally kind of has the first three quarters and then you have typically a pretty big fourth quarter. Should we be expecting then kind of a down EPS first and second quarters, or first half versus 2013?","Jeff Bornstein ","We don\u2019t give guidance at that level. I think you\u2019re correct in assuming that the bulk of what we will invest in simplification next year will be in the first quarter, first half. But we don\u2019t give quarterly earnings guidance.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","I understand that. So I\u2019m not looking for specifics. I\u2019m not off-base in my thinking right? Or is there something else that we should think about, sort of the first half?","Jeff Immelt ","I wouldn\u2019t read into it so much. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a specific profile. And we expect a number of our businesses to be able to come out of the year and perform well in the first quarter.","Jeff Bornstein ","I\u2019ll give you this much. I think we certainly expect industrial segment earnings to grow in the first half. That\u2019s about as much as I can give you. But we\u2019re not giving quarterly guidance.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","No, I understand. That\u2019s helpful. And I want to ask you about the simplification. So we sold the three industrial businesses in the quarter. Jeff Bornstein, as you\u2019ve kind of gotten into this with your team, how would you kind of frame the outlook for cleanup within the industrial segments? I\u2019m not talking about maybe larger scale portfolio simplification down the road. Or just what have you been uncovering, and how that maybe dovetails into some of the restructuring that you guys have been taking in your outlook there?","Jeff Bornstein ","Well, I think we\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio where it makes sense. And you know, there will be more transactions in 2014. I don\u2019t know that there will be, certainly excluding NBCU, the same order of magnitude economically as there was in \u201913. This is an ongoing process, and the businesses are going to continue to go through their portfolio, and we\u2019ll continue to clean up where it doesn\u2019t make sense, or where we\u2019re not willing to invest, or we don\u2019t see the growth there. So that process will continue as we move through 2014.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Maybe one last one for me. Just on the echo oil and gas, on the drilling side, the land-based side, there\u2019s a fairly widely held view that WTI prices, or certainly U.S. oil prices, could be actually heading lower. One, I\u2019m wondering have you seen any of this kind of reflected in Lufkin\u2019s backlog, your recent acquisition, just because the prices of the oilfield service companies, their share prices are down? And how do you guys maybe think about that, because obviously you\u2019re building a long term business? Does this present opportunities actually for M&A, if in fact some of the public company share prices were well off? You could continue to consolidate some of these properties.","Jeff Immelt ","When I look globally and in the various segments in the oil and gas business, kind of the drilling piece in North America probably has been the weakest as time goes on. And if we see opportunities to do more work there, we\u2019re certainly going to do it, because we think over the long term that\u2019s still a good place for us.","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your next question will come from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs ","Quick question on organic growth. You\u2019re exiting the year with a good clip at 5%, orders were up 8% year to date. But you take a look at your guidance for 2013, it looks like organic growth ended negative, your guidance was closer to 2. So my question is really around, as you look into \u201914, what kind of confidence do you have in that 4% to 7% number based on what you already have in backlog? And what are the puts and takes to those numbers to the high end versus the low end of the range?","Jeff Immelt","I don\u2019t know, Jeff, if you went through the unit shipments year over year, we basically haven\u2019t backlogged. You know, Joe, if you just look at that, a big win backlog, shipping more heavy duty gas turbines, the jet engine backlog, etc., etc., it kind of takes you to the 4% to 7% range.","Jeff Bornstein ","The one thing thematically here, we have a couple of unique things at GE, or at least in the same company, which is the GEnx story and the wind story are fairly unique to GE. And that\u2019s a big part of pushing the range to 4% to 7%. After that, we\u2019re somewhere around 3% to 5%, which I don\u2019t think is off color. ","I\u2019ll give you a sense of where we expect units for 2014. Wind we think it\u2019s going to be around 3,000 units versus 2,100 units in \u201913, gas turbines somewhere between 85 and 90 versus 81 in \u201913, locomotives will be between 550 and 600. That will be down slightly. Jet engines will be up, as I just said around GEnx, will be up to 2,500 units, versus about 2,378 in \u201913. And as I mentioned, GEnx will be somewhere between 250 and 300, most of that growth, versus 180. Military is going to be a mix, as it relates to aviation. ","So that gives you a sense of kind of what we\u2019re thinking on units. I did mention earlier in the script that we do have a few areas of softness, mining being one of them, and our locomotives business. Mining\u2019s going to be, we expect, very soft on OHB in 2014. ","Jeff Immelt ","And I would say on the services side, we kind of end the year with the best philosophy we had during the year, so that\u2019s the other piece of the equation.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs ","One question on the gas turbine pricing pressure. It looks like power and water pricing has been down now for two quarters in a row. Can you just provide some color where you\u2019re seeing that regionally? So where are you seeing most of the pricing pressure today?","Jeff Immelt","The region mix is always a relatively big swing in the gas turbine side, so there\u2019s a couple of big deals in Saudi that have been price competitive. And it\u2019s going to be a competitive market, I think. But we\u2019re doing a good job on the cost side, and like I said, I think when we look out over \u201914 and into the future, we still see heavy duty gas [unintelligible] equipment, operating profit dollar growth, in this time period.","Jeff Bornstein ","I would just add to that, if you look at quoting activity in the space around gas turbines, the fourth quarter, definitely the level of activity has picked up. We\u2019re up like 96% versus fourth quarter \u201912, and 26 more projects quoting real time in the fourth quarter than a year ago. And the bulk of that strength has really been in the U.S., surprisingly, and China. So there\u2019s a lot of activity here. I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re necessarily calling a significant turn on gas turbine, but there\u2019s definitely the activity, and you saw the order performance with 65 units in the quarter, 124 for the year, and this quoting activity, we\u2019re hopeful.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs ","And then just one last question. You quantified the impact from the blade issue at $100 million for this quarter. Have you quantified the potential impact on the margins for \u201914?","Jeff Bornstein ","I think what we said was we are not anticipating this being an issue for our framework for the entirety of 2014.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. ","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer ","First, a clarification, then a question. In response to John Inch\u2019s question, or the answer to it, where you expect industrial earnings to go in the first half, was that at the segment level, or post the eliminations line, that comment?","Jeff Bornstein","I was talking about segment earnings.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer ","And then just looking back at how 2013 transpired, operating profit at the industrial segment level is up a little over $700 million, but we had the $900 million value gap and the significant cost out. So just wondering what pieces plug that difference.","Jeff Bornstein ","If you go back to the [unintelligible] that Jeff did for the total year, we spent a bit more in R&D , which partially offset that, and then base inflation, foreign exchange, and other items, we had volume down somewhat. And we didn\u2019t repeat the two big deals I talked about in the fourth quarter year over year, the Duarte deal in aviation and the Thomas deal in medical, which, on a year over year walk, are material differences.","But we feel great about what the team is delivering around simplification and SG&A cost out. That value gap was real positive. We expect it to be positive again, not at the same levels, but we expect it to contribute to margins in \u201914.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura "," ","Real estate, the nonearnings jumped up like 6x this quarter. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there and where are we in terms of unrealized loss and what it means for the equity book in \u201914?","Jeff Bornstein ","We\u2019re executing a reclass in the quarter between our nonearnings calculation and the traditional industry calculation of nonaccrual. And so it\u2019s really just that. When you go through the supplemental, there\u2019s a really detailed note that walks exactly what the tradeoff is between cash basis and cost recovery of assets deemed nonaccrual, and within nonaccrual, nonearning. And so you have a bump up in nonearning, you have a big bump down in nonaccrual, roughly $3 billion. And it walks you through the pieces of it. There\u2019s no change whatsoever in terms of portfolio quality. It\u2019s just how we\u2019re characterizing between nonearning and nonaccrual, and that\u2019s just to get us closer to an industry basis.","The second is on the real estate, I think we ended the year at roughly about $2.1 billion embedded loss, which is basically flat year over year. The biggest change year over year is we\u2019re at I think $1.1 billion roughly at the end of \u201913, as the 30 Rock transaction we did in the first quarter of \u201913, which was more than $1 billion pretax, bumped that up a little bit.","Now having said that, we sold things throughout the year, there\u2019s both the gains and losses, etc., and we kind of find ourselves back at $2 billion. But I think we feel great about where we are in that $14 billion portfolio, and we\u2019ll continue to liquidate it down. And so far, anyway, we\u2019ve outperformed the embedded loss numbers we\u2019ve been sharing with you for the last five years.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura ","And then on pension, where are you going to end up for \u201914 in terms of operating and nonoperating pension and funded status?","Jeff Bornstein ","We ended \u201913 at about 91% on the funded status. The deficit in the principal pension plan was down just under $9 billion year over year, driven by portfolio performance. We were up 14.3% in terms of the earnings on pension assets and the discount rate was up to 485 basis points. So that took the deficit down fairly substantially. ","In terms of pension next year, we expect pension in total, as I shared with you guys, to be down roughly $900 million next year. A significant percentage of that will be in \\non-op pension. You know, the operating pension benefit will be something south of $400 million, but about in that range. We need to kind of finalize exactly where all these year-end ending points, how they\u2019re going to play out in pension expense. So we expect to be down about $900 million in total, with a little less than 40% of that associated with operating pension. ","Operator","The last question we have will come from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse ","I had one question in oil and gas again. Measurement and control I think was the one piece of that you had high hopes for a year ago. It fell short of those, and it sounded like you thought it would come back in \u201914. And now it sounds like you\u2019re a bit more circumspect. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about measurement and control, what are your current expectations there for this year?","Jeff Immelt ","We\u2019re kind of expecting flattish, maybe up marginally, but nothing substantial. But I think we showed you guys at the outlook meeting that we still expect strong top line and bottom line growth in oil and gas. And that\u2019s reflective of measurement and control in the flattish range. So that\u2019s kind of where we are. I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what other people in the industry say as well.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse ","But you don\u2019t anticipate a large wave of downstream projects in the U.S. to push up orders there any time soon?","Jeff Immelt ","We\u2019re hopeful, but that\u2019s not the base plan. The base plan is, I would say, kind of like that it\u2019s bottomed and we\u2019ll see flattish kind of growth in \u201914, and we\u2019re taking cost out and stuff like that.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse ","And then just within healthcare, most industrial markets and emerging markets have slowed over the last two years. Healthcare has been an exception. I guess your Q4 emerging markets growth numbers were not great, or certainly lower than what you had seen in the last 12 months. Is that anything you think to be concerned about? Is that maybe reflecting a lag versus broader economic slowdowns? Or do you think it\u2019s a blip and healthcare in emerging markets should remain strong?","Jeff Immelt ","You know, we had a real strong fourth quarter in Russia last year, and it was down substantially this year. And net of that, healthcare growth markets were still pretty good. China was a little bit slower, but not concerning. And the other growth markets were pretty good.","Everybody, I just want to say thanks to Trevor. He did a great job. Fantastic. And I appreciate everybody\u2019s acknowledgement, but Trevor, fantastic for all of us. Thanks for a great job. And welcome to Matt. And Trevor\u2019s sprinting to the door, guys. So thanks for your great support of Trevor as well.","Trevor Schauenberg ","Thank you very much, Jeff, and thank everyone else for all the fun we\u2019ve had together the last five and a half years. And best of luck, Matt. I know you\u2019ll love the job and do great.","The replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website.

I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Thank you, Chanel. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to host today's first quarter 2012 earnings webcast.","Regarding the materials for the webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning, and the presentation slides are available via the webcast. Slides are available for download and printing on our website, www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of the presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today's webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO, Keith Sherin. ","Now I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Great, Trevor. Good morning, everybody. Thanks. This year, we outlined 2 important catalysts for GE: double-digit earnings growth in Industrial; and a dividend from GE Capital pending Fed review. ","In the first quarter, our Industrial business has achieved a 10% earnings growth, and GE Capital is exceeding our expectations, so we really had a good quarter. Externally, global markets are improving but volatility remains. Infrastructure demand is generally healthy and the U.S. is better. We're watching Europe with caution. We had the strongest Industrial growth performance since the crisis: 20% orders growth, 11% organic revenue growth and 16% expansion in growth markets. GE Capital grew by 27% excluding the impact of the Garanti gain. ","Real Estate turned positive in the quarter, which is a positive sign for the year, and we ended the quarter with lots of cash and strong cash flow. Our Tier 1 common ratio is 10.4%, a very healthy level. And we remain on track to hit our margin target for the year. So everything we saw in the first quarter supports double-digit earnings growth. ","Orders were robust off a very high base. Orders growth was broad-based. Equipment was up 29%, Service was up 11%, emerging markets grew by 24% and organic orders growth was up 14%. We're benefiting from several macro themes: global infrastructure investment, healthcare access, gas conversion and favorable transportation and energy markets. ","Over the last 2 years, we redeployed capital from NBC to Oil & Gas. This is paying off with a 64% growth in Oil & Gas orders. ","Orders pricing was positive, which is a great sign for the future. This is the highest first quarter orders in history. It feels like we're outpacing the market gaining share, and backlog ended at $201 billion, another record. ","As I said, organic revenue growth was up 11% in the quarter, very strong. We had 4 or 5 businesses in 6 of 9 growth regions with 10%-plus organic growth. China grew by 18%, on track with our expectations. Service growth was 11%, which is up 8% organically, and we're doing well in the marketplace. ","Aviation is winning a lot of campaigns. The GEnx is doing well. The LEAP-X, with applications on the A320neo, 737 Max and C919, is also doing great. The Qantas win is big for our Aviation business. ","We're launching 71 new products in Healthcare versus 50 last year. ","Our Energy product line is strong, supporting 39% orders growth. We're launching new products in our acquisitions, which on balance, are outperforming their plans. ","Appliances is beginning to launch its Mission 1 products in 2Q with a new water heater and refrigerator. Our investments in growth are really paying off. ","We've always expected margins to ramp during the year. Healthcare and Transportation have already begun to turn. In the first quarter of '12, we had a negative impact of energy backlog pricing, acquisitions and wind volume that moved from the second quarter to the first quarter. However, we see improvements in value gap acquisitions and easing R&D spending as the year progresses. And we will continue to drive productivity in restructuring programs, particularly in Europe. ","Over the past 5 years, we've seen as much as a 200 basis point margin improvement from the first quarter to the total year. So we see 50 basis points improvement as an important commitment for 2012 and 2013. ","Cash and liquidity remain very strong. Our CFOA grew by 22% in the quarter, behind improved earnings and working capital performance. We ended the quarter with $84 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We're managing this CFOA growth despite having stronger equipment shipments, and we expect CFOA to be strong for the year. ","Also on GE Capital, GE Capital had a very good quarter. Our balance sheet is strong. We have a 10.4% Tier 1 common ratio of 50 basis points from the fourth quarter '11, and our nonearnings are down $300 million. Our liquidity is safe and sound. Our commercial paper coverage is 2.5x, and we have $76 billion of cash on the GE Capital balance sheet. ","We're on track for our ENI goals. We should hit our $425 billion ENI target for 2012. We're reducing red assets like the Irish mortgages. And Commercial Real Estate profitability in the quarter is really quite significant. ","Finally, we're able to originate profitable new business. We feel great about expanding our net interest margins. We're originating new business in excess of a 3% return on investment, and our ongoing net income growing by 27% is a good sign. The business is executing well. ","Now over to Keith for an update on financials.","Keith S. Sherin","Thanks, Jeff. I'm going to start with the first quarter summary. As you can see, we had continuing operations revenues of $35.2 billion and that was reported down 8%. This is the last quarter we're going to have to compare to the impact from NBCU. So last year in the first quarter, we owned NBC for one month and we had that revenue and we had the $3.6 billion pretax gain from the sale. So if you adjust for NBC in the first quarter of last year, that would give you a 4% growth on the $35 billion of revenue. ","Industrial sales of $23.7 billion are up 7%. I think a better reflection of our growth is down on the right side of the chart. Without any impact from NBCU, you can see the Industrial segment revenues were up 14%. ","GE Capital revenues of $11.4 billion were down 12%. If you look at Q1 last year, we had the Garanti bank sale that was recorded in GE Capital. If you exclude the impact of Garanti last year, GE Capital revenues were down about 7% in line with the overall asset shrinkage. ","Operating earnings at $3.6 billion were up 1%. Operating earnings per share of $0.34 were up 3%. And continuing earnings per share includes the impact of the nonoperating pension. And net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations, reflecting the $0.02 charge this year, which I'll cover on the next page. ","Cash of $2.1 billion for the quarter was very strong as Jeff covered. On taxes, the consolidated rate for the first quarter was 16%. That was down slightly from 2011 excluding the impact of the high tax and NBCU gain. ","If you look at the pieces, the GE rate of 23% was 1 point higher than last year, excluding the NBCU impact. And we're forecasting a continuation of that low 20s rate for the rest of the year for GE Industrial. ","The GE Capital rate of 9% is lower than the mid-teens range that we previously forecast. As the quarter unfolded, we identified additional international tax planning benefits, and they're going to impact the GE Capital rate for the year. So right now, our forecast is about a 10% rate for the full year for GECC. ","On the right side of the segment results, Industrial revenues were up 14%. Industrial segment profit was up 10%, driven by double-digit growth in Transportation and Energy and Healthcare. GE Capital earnings were reported at flat. However, they were up significantly excluding the impact to last year's Garanti gain, and I'll show you how that affects GE Capital later at the GE Capital page. ","So we'll go through each of the segments in more detail on a page here. ","Before I get to the business results, though, here's the summary of other items from the first quarter. First, we realized a $0.01 after-tax gain from the formation of an aviation JV, which we recorded that gain at corporate. We completed the JV formation with AVIC for future avionic products and that resulted in $0.01 after tax. We also had $0.01 after tax of restructuring and other charges in the quarter. The charge is primarily related to a continued cost structure and improvements at Energy, Healthcare, GE Capital. We also had a onetime cost related to the acquisitions and other non-repeat items. ","On the bottom of the page, we entered into a LOI to sell our Irish consumer mortgage assets and the operating platform in Ireland. And as a result of that LOI, we recognized a charge this quarter. This is consistent with our strategy of reducing the red assets in the portfolio. And although the final terms have not been negotiated and certainly not announced, we did recognize a loss in discontinued operations of $188 million after tax. And this allows us to exit the most challenged mortgage book that we have, and that's going to be positive as we go forward. ","And then one last item on this page, we thought -- just to try and clarify the reported results year-over-year on the top right, the normalized earnings box. It shows you a walk of how we looked at normalized operating EPS adjusting for the gains and the onetime charges last year and this year. So if you look last year, our reported operating EPS was $0.33, but that included $0.01 net benefit from the combination of the NBCU gain, which was partially offset by $0.03 of restructuring. Plus, we had $0.03 from the Garanti sale gain last year that was reported to GE Capital. ","So if you look at last year's first quarter normalized, it was $0.29. And this year, reported $0.34 with no net impact from the other items. So the normalized operating earnings performance is much stronger than the reported variance. ","I'll go to the businesses and we'll start with Energy. Overall results were strong. We had revenue growth at 18%. We had double-digit profit growth. And I'll start with the details of the Energy business. We continue to see strong orders growth, as Jeff showed you. Orders of $7.7 billion were up 21%. Equipment orders of $4.1 billion were up 29%. That was driven some by the acquisitions plus 12 points from organic growth. Renewable orders of $1.5 billion were up 59%. We had orders for 696 wind turbines versus 327 in the first quarter of last year. Thermal orders of $700 million were down 7%. We had orders for 23 gas turbines versus 27 in the first quarter of '11. And overall, Energy orders pricing was a positive 0.2%. Equipment orders pricing was down 0.2% and that was driven by thermal, which was negative 1%. Wind was negative 1.5%, offset by positive equipment pricing in energy management. ","And if you look at the combined thermal and Power Gen Services orders, the price impact there was also positive 0.7%. So orders pricing is definitely abating and it turned in total for the Energy business. ","Service orders of $3.6 billion were up 13%, and revenues in the quarter of $8 billion were up 13%. That was driven by strong volume. Plus, we had about 5 points of that growth from acquisitions. So good organic growth. ","Equipment revenues of $4.5 billion was up 16%. We had a strong renewables quarter. Revenues of $1.5 billion were up 30%. We shipped 611 wind turbines versus 366 last year, and that was about 200 more than we planned in the quarter. Thermal revenue of $1.8 billion was up 2%. So we shipped 35 gas turbines versus 32 last year. And aero revenue of $560 million was up 68%. And service revenues of $3.5 billion were up 10%. ","Segment profit of $1.2 billion was up 6%. That was driven by the higher volumes plus some benefit from the acquisitions, partially offset by the lower pricing from the wind and thermal backlog deliveries. ","Oil & Gas. They just continue to experience tremendous growth. Orders of $4.4 billion were up 47%. Even after adjusting for the acquisitions, orders were up 28% organically. Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were up 64%, driven by strong subsea orders in Australia and Angola. And service orders of $2 billion were up 31%, driven by drilling and surface services. The orders price index for Oil & Gas was up 1%. Revenue of $3.4 billion was up 34%, and that was driven by strong equipment revenues, $1.6 billion, was up 26% or 16% organically. And service revenues of $1.8 billion were up 41% or 20% organically. ","Segment profit of $400 million was up 31%, driven by the acquisitions and the core growth. The acquisitions continue to deliver results ahead of our pro formas. And the organic segment profit of Oil & Gas was up 12%, driven by the strong volume, partially offset by higher variable costs on some of their output. ","So pretty good quarter overall in Energy. Great to have them at double digits. ","Next, we'll go to Aviation. The Aviation team delivered another solid quarter in the first quarter. We took the JV gain out of the segment, so the reported results exclude the gain that was reported in corporate. Orders of $5.6 billion were up 8%. Commercial engine orders of $1.6 billion were up 36%, driven by strong orders for GE90, CFM56 and CF6 engines. ","Military equipment orders of $500 million, they were down 20%, driven by a few lower engines but also lower development from the JSF termination. Service orders of $3 billion were up 6%. Commercial services were down 3%, driven by lower spare parts. Our first quarter average daily order rate was $23 million, which was down 10% as we saw some softness driven by Europe. ","Total orders price index for the business was up 2.1%. Revenue of $4.9 billion was up 12%, driven by strong equipment volume. We shipped 583 commercial engines versus 503 last year, up 16%. And service revenues were up 3%. ","Segment profit of $862 million was up 2% as the benefits of that higher volume and positive price were partially offset by higher R&D investments and the impact of higher equipment versus services mix. ","On the right side, Transportation. Transportation had another great quarter. Orders of $1.6 billion were up 67%. Equipment orders of $1 billion were up 131%, driven by North American and international locomotive orders. We also straw -- saw strong mining vehicle equipment orders. Service orders were up 13%, and orders pricing was up 1%. Revenue of $1.3 billion was up 41%, driven by the strong volume. We shipped 159 locomotives versus 70 in the first quarter last year. And our mining equipment revenue was also up 40% in the quarter. ","Service revenues of $550 million were up 7%, driven by the higher long-term service agreement and parts volume. And segment profit of $232 million was up 48%, driven by the higher volume and positive pricing. ","Next is Healthcare. Healthcare had a strong first quarter. Good orders. Orders of $4.4 billion were up 6%. I'll give you some details on the equipment orders: $2.4 billion, they were up 12%. It was driven by strong growth across-the-board. The U.S. was up 15% on equipment. Latin America was up 33%. China was up 31%. Eastern Europe and the Middle East were up 22%. Asia Pacific was up 11%. And Europe was the one soft spot, down 6%. ","Service orders of $2 billion were flat. And total orders price was down 1.4%. Revenue in the quarter of $4.3 billion was up 5% driven by the growth markets, which were up 17% in volume. And revenue in the U.S. was up 3%. And in Europe, it was down 4%. ","Segment profit of $585 million was up 10%, driven by volume and productivity, partially offset by the pricing. ","And on the right side, Home & Business Solutions had another tough quarter, but the level of decline has slowed significantly. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 5%, driven by strong pricing. The domestic appliance market was down 10% in units and we gained core share. We also saw volume pressure from lighting in Europe. European markets were soft. ","Overall segment profit of $66 million was down 11% as the benefits of the higher pricing in appliances and lighting were more than offset by inflation and by our investments in the new product programs. We started shipping the hot water heater and we'll be shipping the Bottom Mount Refrigerator starting in the second quarter. So they're making great progress on all their Mission 1 investments. ","And next is GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team delivered another very positive quarter. Revenue of $11.4 billion was reported down 12%. However, as I said, if you exclude the Garanti impact, revenue was down 7%. Reported net income was flat. But as you can see, excluding Garanti, it was up 27%. So overall, it was another very strong quarter. ","We ended the quarter with $436 billion of ending investment, already below our original $440 billion target and we're on the way to the $425 billion for the year. And our net interest margin was 4.8%, up 38 basis points. There are more details on GE Capital and margins and in asset quality in the supplemental deck that we posted this morning.","If you look over at the right side, you can see the asset quality metrics continue to be good. Delinquencies fell in the mortgage business. They fell in U.S. retail. They were up slightly in Real Estate and CLL. A big highlight for the team was the Commercial Real Estate delivering positive earnings. It's the first time in over 3 years, and I'll cover Real Estate in a minute. And we saw a good volume and good margins, and our other asset quality metrics remain strong. ","So if you go by business, I'll start with Consumer. Our Consumer results were much better than the reported variance shows. We're comparing here to no repeat of the first quarter '11 Garanti income. On a normalized basis, the first quarter '12 Consumer results were up around 4%. That includes a really strong performance in U.S. ","The U.S. Retail business had a great quarter with net income of $641 million, up 18%, driven by lower losses and higher margins. Our portfolio's in good shape. U.S. Retail delinquency of 4.4% was down 54 basis points from the fourth quarter, and it's at the lowest level in 9 years, which is the only reported period that we have on these current basis. So just a great asset quality and performance in the portfolio. ","Europe had net income of $122 million, down year-over-year from Garanti. Our U.K. home lending business earned $57 million in the quarter. And we exited our Greek bonds in the quarter. We took a $21 million after-tax loss. We have no remaining Greek bond exposure. ","Real Estate had positive earnings of $56 million in the quarter. This is a great improvement, as you know, up $414 million from the first quarter of '11, up $210 million from the fourth quarter of '11. In the quarter, we had $25 million of after-tax credit costs and $30 million of after-tax margin impairments. During the quarter, we also sold 103 properties worth about $500 million for a $56 million after-tax gain. ","We continue to see strong global liquidity. It's helped improve valuations. And while we're pleased with these results, there will be a European portfolio valuation review in the second quarter. But overall, the Real Estate team has started the year ahead of our expectations, off to a great start. ","Commercial Lending & Leasing business delivered strong results. While assets were down 4%, net income of $685 million was up 24% driven by lower credit costs, lower margin impairments and core income growth. Americas is the big driver. Net income of $542 million was up 18%. Europe net income of $59 million was down 35%, mainly driven by lower assets year-over-year, as well as higher provisions in Italy. ","GECAS had a good quarter. Earnings of $318 million were up 4% driven by higher core margin, partially offset by lower gains. We sold 22 aircraft in the quarter for a gain of $21 million. And portfolio quality remained strong. We ended the quarter with one aircraft on the ground out of our portfolio of over 1,500 aircraft. ","Energy Financial Services earnings of $71 million were down 37%. That's driven by $45 million of lower gains. Last year's Q1 results included $50 million from our Caithness wind farm sale. ","So GE Capital's off to a strong start for '12, and let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Great, Keith. Thanks. Just to reflect on the 2012 operating framework. We really have no change to the 2012 operating framework. We still see a solid double-digit growth in both Industrial and GE Capital. If anything, progress in Commercial Real Estate, Energy and Healthcare make us even more confident. We will continue to do restructuring to lower our costs. Our CFOA and revenues are better than our expectations in the first quarter. The year is progressing the way we thought in December. And again, we're confident in our operating framework for the year. ","To summarize, I'd just make several points. Our markets continue to be attractive. Investments have accelerated our organic growth and lead to a strong competitive position. Margin improvements will accelerate through the year. Healthcare and Transportation margin growth has begun. I'm encouraged by the orders pricing trend, and again, margins are important for the GE team. ","The GE Capital is very strong. The turn of Commercial Real Estate's important and makes us feel positive about the balance of 2012. ","Our cash flow was solid. Our plan is to resume the GE Capital dividend subject to Fed review, and our capital allocation will be balanced and investor-friendly. ","We don't take the environment for granted. We continue to be vigilant in risk management in a volatile world. And we have strong liquidity, and we're prepared for a variety of different outcomes. ","And finally, I think we're very well positioned again for double-digit earnings growth in both Industrial and GE Capital. ","So with that, Trevor, let me turn it back over to you, and let's take some questions.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Keith. Chanel, why don't we turn over to our questions? Let's go through them.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Maybe, Jeff, just to start off, if you could give us a little bit of a sense on how you expect the margin ramp through the year. And I know it may be hard to quantify it exactly, but you're starting off in a little bit of a hole in Energy Infrastructure to get your 50 bps for the year. I mean how do you kind of see the rest of the year playing out?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","So Scott, I'd first say that the first quarter is typically the low quarter. We've seen expansion over the last 5 years anywhere from 80 to 200 basis points on the total year. I think what you're going to see in the rest of the year is a positive value gap. You're going to see a reduction in R&D spending as a percentage of the total, improved acquisition performance in the run rate and I would say the impact of restructuring and productivity programs. So I would see as the year goes on, Healthcare, Transportation, solidly growing margin rates through the year. Aviation, we're expecting Aviation to be up 50 basis points on the year. Again, we had some unusual -- unusually high R&D in Q1. And then on Energy, I always break down Energy in the subcomponents. I think Service margins will be up. I think Oil & Gas has a good shot to have positive operating profit leverage on the year. I think Equipment margins will be down. And I think in the -- our gas turbine equipment margins will be down based on what's on the backlog. And I'd say wind is just a wildcard given how much volume could actually take place in 2012 just based on the strength of the market. So what I would say, Scott, is our costs are on plan. Our pricing performance is on plan. We've got lots of activities going to increase margins as the year goes on. And that's kind of how I -- what I don't always control is the amount of revenue that any one individual product's having, but we've tried to build in a little bit of buffer for negative mix, and that's kind of how I handicap the year. So I would say Aviation up, Transportation up, Healthcare up. Energy could swing anywhere from up slightly to down slightly. And that's kind of the plan for the year. But the execution, the underlying execution, is happening about the way we thought and the orders pricing and the pricing on new commitments, I think, bodes well for the rest of '12 and '13. So that's the way I would triangulate.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And Jeff, as a follow-up, your old business, Healthcare, I mean I was -- I mean, I think there was a lot of concerns in the quarter that Europe could really fall apart. And it didn't really. I mean you're only down 4%. I mean what -- how do you look at or how do you think about that business for the rest of the year, particularly in Europe?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Scott, I think it's a great question. I think Europe is -- we had planned on a tough year in Europe in Healthcare, and it's kind of coming in to be about what we had thought. I'd say the U.S. activity is a little bit better than we thought. And then there's places we don't talk a lot about like Japan, which -- where the Healthcare market is very strong, both on a relative basis compared to last year and also in total. So I saw probably -- we probably saw higher orders activity in Q1 than we expected and I would say in general, not just in Healthcare in Europe but in general, it's kind of hanging in there per our expectations.","Keith S. Sherin","Yes, Scott. One interesting point about Europe for Healthcare is that Germany, the Netherlands, the U.K. and the Nordic had pretty good orders performance, and Southern Europe is in a lot tougher shape. So there's a real split going on there in terms of the economic activity. That helped us a bit.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sorry if you already answered this, but the down, I guess, on the gas turbine order side, first of all, it was -- I think what you said it was down from last year, but also the price there was only down 1%, I think, is what you said. How do we think about that trajectory on both those dynamic -- on both those data points throughout the course of the year?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, first of all, on the volume side, we've said that we expect to deliver about 137 gas turbines this year, so that'll be up. There's no change to that outlook. We're seeing some good discussions globally for equipment volume and so I think from a volume perspective, we have a pretty good outlook and consistent with our framework. From a pricing, this is really encouraging, I would say. If you look at thermal last year, it was down 6% in the first quarter, 10% in the second quarter, 7.5%, 12.5% in the fourth quarter. To go to 1.1% down and to be positive including the Service business, I think that shows that we've been saying that the discussions around commitments on gas turbines have been healthy, that pricing was stabilizing, and so it's the start of a turn for us and I am reasonably encouraged by it.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So there's nothing unusual. You think you can get to -- I mean if it's down 1% today and environment is still getting better, you think you can get to positive at some point this year?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, we've said I think down in the Analyst Meeting, we talked about by the end of the year showing a single positive and we're hoping that, that can be what happens with us. We've got pretty good discussions going on commercially with customers. There's still an overhang of supply versus demand. But globally, there's order activity. We're going to have a good volume growth this year. And this first quarter is indicative of where pricing is in the commitment world and where it's going, we think.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I think commitments are positive, Steve. That's usually a pretty good indication. And my hunch by this is going to bode well or should bode well for '13. Think about just the gas turbine margins. So I don't see any change to that. And to Keith's point earlier, I think we see a lot of activity on gas turbine demand, let's say, in a lot of different parts of the world.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then just on the GE Capital front, you guys talked about -- I don't know if that was a change in language, talking about return of capital throughout 2012 as opposed to by the end of 2012. Is there a potential for maybe some more measured return of capital but through several time periods throughout the course of the year? Is there -- is that a purposeful change in language, or how do we read that?","Keith S. Sherin","I don't think there's any purposeful change there. Our intent is to have a dividend as a percent of GE Capital's earnings that we pay to the parent. And we -- our overall objective is to return excess capital above the capital levels required by the regulatory standards and all the stress tests back to the parent as well. So there's no real change on that. We're working constructively with the regulator. We've got a ton of activity going on with them, and they're working very professionally with us. And so our objective is unchanged. And as soon as we get news, we'll give it to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a little more color on price in gas turbines, if we could. Are all those price -- order price numbers you're giving year-over-year changes?","Keith S. Sherin","Yes.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","They are -- they're not sequential. And then I'm just also just wondering, Keith, as you noted, things are clearly look like they're getting better but your 7, 8, 9 quarters of negative price. As your sales price caught up -- sales price in revenue caught up with your order price, can you give us some color on what gas turbine pricing and deliveries was in the quarter?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, sure. We're working through that backlog. Overall sales price in the quarter for the whole company was 0.6% positive on the Industrial side. For Energy Infrastructure, it was 0.4% negative. For thermal, it was down 2.5%. For renewables, it was down 4%. So we are eating through that backlog that we've got. But overall, for the company, including the strength in Aviation, the strength in Transportation, the strength in Oil & Gas, pretty good on pricing overall. But we're going to work our way through that backlog this year.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I'd say the other piece of that, Jeff, is the value gap is positive in the quarter, which is a little bit better than planned. So we're seeing a little bit of break on commodity pricing, which is good and that's, I think, bodes well for margins in the rest of the year.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And on wind, those 200 units in Q1, is that additional units relative to what you expected for the year or is that just some shift between the quarters?","Keith S. Sherin","From Q2, we saw tremendous orders in wind. I think we're going to have a very good year in wind this year. The U.S. market is very robust, as you know. The production tax credits end by the end of the year, and we're taking a really good share in the marketplace and we're going to have a terrific performance. So they had some additional units versus what we thought in the first quarter. But so far, it's from second quarter.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","But, Jeff, wind could run hot for the year, I think. It's just we've got a good product, our market shares are high and there's a ton of activity there right now.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And then just finally, on the Irish ops that went to disc. ops, do you guys have any guarantees or make-goods or anything attached to that where we might be concerned about some kind of discontinued tail on that?","Keith S. Sherin","We do not. That will be a complete exit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Just first question on GE Capital. Just looking at, I guess, the reserve ratios on Page 9 of the supplemental, can you just give a little color on how you were thinking about -- I guess, they've come down to 1.99% sequentially from last quarter to 2.1%. So just the steady trend down, improvement in the environment, how you're thinking about that on a provisioning and reserve basis.","Keith S. Sherin","Well, I think we continue to see stabilization across on the financing receivables side and with loss provisions and write-off stabilization across almost all the portfolios of GE Capital. So I would expect you're going to continue to see a little bit of a decline as we work our way through the write-offs for existing provided losses. But the new provisions that we're laying on today are representative of pretty good run rate, I would say, a very healthy run rate based on a good backdrop. The main change that we've seen is the decline in the marks and the write-offs in the equity book in Real Estate, specifically. So the run rates for new provisions for financing receivables are pretty good rates and at historically low levels, I would say, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. So we're pretty close to what you expect for a run rate reserve ratio?","Keith S. Sherin","On the provision for losses. We're going to continue to have the write-offs on prior provided losses that will probably be a little higher than new provisions.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then on that real estate point you mentioned, I guess there was -- you said $0.5 billion for 56 transactions or I think it was 50 -- sorry, $56 million, right? Was that -- did I hear that correctly for profit?","Keith S. Sherin","That's right. We had a gain. We sold about $500 million, a little over 100 properties. $500 million of fair market value for a $56 million after-tax gain.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Does that mean -- so it would have been, I guess, 0 -- net-net 0 on segment profit roughly for the quarter without those. Is the debt business getting better, too?","Keith S. Sherin","The debt business made money. The debt business made about $30 million after tax in the quarter.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, all right, great. And then just a question on the Industrial...","Keith S. Sherin","How much -- hold on, I'm sorry. 86? Sorry, the debt business made $86 million. The debt business had a pretty good quarter and we lost some money on the equity business.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. So I think you guys covered the whole Energy pricing pretty well. Just let me -- on the Aviation side, I know you mentioned you've got higher R&D driving it, but could you provide a little color on that margin degradation? Was it all that? Was some -- to what extent is pricing a factor there? Are you seeing any degradation in pricing spares, things like that?","Keith S. Sherin","Sure. Pricing was pretty good. Overall, the margins were down in the quarter of 170 basis points in Aviation. Positive value gap was a full point. We had positive price and then we had negative mix basically. We had a lot more Equipment revenue than Services revenue as we continued to deliver a lot of commercial activity. And then we had about $50 million from higher R&D investment. And as Jeff said, that's going to abate through the year. We're kind of at the run rate. And if you compare to last year, we already had reached that run rate in the second half in Aviation. So that won't be a drag going forward that you saw in the first quarter, but pricing continues to be very strong in both spares and equipment in Aviation.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. And that mix, you anticipate continuing to be negative for the rest of the year, but no worse or...","Keith S. Sherin","Well, we're going to ship a lot of equipment. We've got a big backlog and Boeing and Airbus have increased their run rates, and we've got a good share position. So we're going to ship a lot of equipment. But what we'd like to see through the year, as Jeff said, is the spares to grow a little bit as a percent of the total as we go through the year. Spares is -- as we said, the orders were down a little bit. The shipments were down about 2% in the quarter, and our expectation is that those will grow relative to last year as we go through the year. So that should get a little better as we go through the year for Aviation.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Right. And given your mix of orders that you're talking about on that, does that mean when I look at that backlog not changing from 2011 year end to first quarter on that second or third slide, should we expect sort of a stable backlog or you expect that to start coming up now a little bit more strongly in the following quarters on equipment?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, we'll have to see. I don't really have a forecast of orders versus the deliveries on the total. I don't really forecast the backlog. We've got good, good global growth. We've got good equipment growth that we've had. As you know, the Aviation orders can be little lumpy, but we've got a tremendous backlog. We're in great shape here. I don't think that's going to be an issue for us as we go through the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess on Energy, the equipment side, I guess, has been sort of fairly well discussed. I mean in terms of the aftermarket in Service and Energy, the growth rate on service orders was about the same year-on-year as it was in Q4. If you look at the U.S. market, the electricity produced by gas-powered equipment is up year-on-year even though overall electricity demand is down. So I guess are you seeing any kind of effect from that in terms of driving aftermarket business for gas turbines in the U.S. or is it going to be something like nuclear in Japan where there are a lot of hopes that, that would spur a nuclear service boom, which for some reason even though there was a nuclear accident, that never actually happened?","Keith S. Sherin","We had a pretty good activity in gas turbines in Japan. Look, I think it's all good. When you look at the power plants that are running in the U.S. and the proportion of the power that's being generated from gas and how that's increased, that's a good news item for us. A lot of the outages for these customers are scheduled a year or more in advance. So those are kind of in place. But the fact that these gas turbines are running and they're running more and they're being dispatched, the rates that they're being dispatched is all good. I think it's going to be positive into '13 and '14 and beyond. We're not seeing a short-term pickup right now in PGS from that because most of the stuff, as we said, is scheduled, but this is all good news.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. But your service order growth rates in Energy theoretically should accelerate from the 6% or 7% recent run rate?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, I think over time, you're going to get the benefit of the dispatching that we're seeing, absolutely. But again, these are long-cycle assets and I think you're going to see that over time. I don't think you're going to see that as a April, May pickup just because they're dispatching the way they are. I think they're going to run these and they're going to burn a lot of metal parts, and it's going to be good long term for us.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on Aviation. Some discussion around the mix of OE and service. I guess it was my understanding that GEnx shipments in Q1 were fairly light and so does that not mean that you have a very steep sequential ramp of GEnx shipments through the year and that's going to weigh on your Aviation margins even in subsequent quarters?","Keith S. Sherin","Yes, I think if you look at the total year, we're in decent shape. We had a pretty good run rate at GEnxs in the second half. In the second quarter, we are going to ramp up. We shipped 13 units in the first quarter of '12. That was about flat to last year. For the second quarter, we're going to be up to 25 to 30 units. And last year, in the second quarter, we had 4. But when you get to the second half, if we're shipping 25 to 30 units in the third and fourth quarter, that's about the run rate we had last year. That's why I think that's going to be helpful as you look at the Aviation margin impact going into the second half.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","GEnx continues to come down the learning curve. And like Keith said, we had $50 million more in R&D in Q1 versus last year and that normalizes as well. So I'd say Aviation is -- there's always puts and takes with any one of our businesses, but it's about where we thought we'd be.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes. So the sale of the Irish business, what does that tell us about the risk appetite of the buyers in the financial world? I can't imagine it was a particularly easy business to sell. Does this raise probability of seeing some sort of exits on some of these red line assets?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, we'll see. I think, for us, it was just sort of a -- when you do have a chance to take a look at a portfolio that had the dynamics this one had and you get a buyer and we came to the point where you got, we think, a good economic return for shareholders, we'll pursue it. There's not a lot of other parts of the portfolio that are like that. But as you say, as liquidity has come back into the market, this is a particularly challenging one and it was a unique buyer, I would say. But there are signs of improved liquidity across a lot of our asset classes. And you see the valuation improvements that we see in real estate. We will pursue opportunities as the bid and the ask gaps close here.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And what were the operating losses for that business? I mean I'm sure it wasn't $0.02 a quarter.","Keith S. Sherin","Last year, we lost about $150 million after tax. Yes, we expected it to improve some this year, but we'll see.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then switching to Industrial. Again, going back to the gas market in the U.S. Do you have a sense on where the utilization rates for your turbines are right now because there's been a 5-point mix shift year-over-year in gas production. And do you think -- I mean, obviously, the service benefits is clear down the road. But with the high utilization, does that spur orders quicker than maybe you might have thought in 2012?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","You mean, Nigel, orders for new units?","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Exactly.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Yes, look, I think just macro, the good news is almost everywhere in the world people are moving to gas. So the macro is -- the macro scene is very good. Our products are being used at a higher level. That should bode well for Services not just this year, but next. And again, I think when does the next U.S. heavy equipment order start? It's still hard to tell. But just given growth in electricity and reserve rates and stuff like -- reserve margins and stuff like that, it will come and it's going to be gas. And I think that's the...","Keith S. Sherin","All roads lead to gas, Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","That's the bottom line I would give you. I would say China, the penetration of gas in China is growing. The penetration of gas in Japan is growing. The penetration of gas everywhere else in the world is growing, so -- and that we have relatively high market share there. We think every aspect I could give you is encouraging for the long term. I just -- I can't predict if it's going to be second quarter or third quarter, but it's coming.","Keith S. Sherin","I think one point on the thermal business that's helpful, we've diversified the business so much today that the thermal contribution from a profit perspective is less than 10% of the total profit on the Energy Infrastructure business. So the upside is in the front of us here.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Yes.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, and then just one more. We've seen Mitsubishi selling a couple of J-Series turbines and I think Siemens got an H-series last month. What is your strategy with your H Frame turbine? It seems that you talk a lot about the FlexEfficiency turbine, but the H-series seems to -- you don't seem to talk much about that. But what sort of demand do you see out there for your H Frame?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","We're going to have a big block in the next few years, and I think we'll be able to cover all of those areas I think. And a lot of our customers like the Flex. We still think that's a good place to own, but we'll also have a big block.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry Darling, Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess listening to all the comment on GE Capital and the lower tax rate, I guess I'm wondering why the operating framework for GE Capital hasn't moved up here. What's holding you back or what are you still concerned about there, relative to you had a very strong 1Q and kind of the lower delinquency trends and all the other trends you see out there?","Keith S. Sherin","Okay, I think we have to see how the year plays out. It's a pretty good quarter. I think you're right. We've got some positives. I think tax is a positive. I think Commercial Real Estate is off to a good start. It's a positive. I think, if you look, we're cautious on Europe. I think so far, so good, but we're cautious on it. I think low natural gas prices, we're cautious on that in the Energy Financial Services portfolio. But overall, these guys are off to a good start and the outlook in the marketplace is pretty good.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Terry, double plus is double plus. We're not trying to be cute, but it's a good year. There's nothing in the first quarter that makes us discouraged about how GE Capital should perform this year.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then Keith, for the good and welfare, any items you want to call out with regards to comps or any other items in the second quarter that we all just ought to be refreshed on?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, there's nothing on 2012 that I'm aware of. If you go -- I think one thing I mentioned we're going to have more GEnx shipments, but we mentioned that. That's in Aviation. I think if you look at last year's Other Items page, we'll have to see how we compare to some of those things. There were small gains in Aviation that don't repeat and a gain in corporate. But there's nothing significant in 2012 that I'm aware of right now.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then I appreciate it's -- we're not going to get things nailed down here from you on Fed timing, but I'm wondering if you can explain it. It has taken longer than initially expected that was -- the decks were cleared on that point last quarter. Since the last quarter, has the process proceeded at a similar pace as what you had seen before? Has it been slower? Has it been faster? Any color there at all for us?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, yes, I'd say it's proceeding at a similar pace. I can tell you that both the GE Capital team and the team from the Fed are working incredibly hard. You have to appreciate how much work the Fed has to go through here to try and learn a business as global and as diverse as GE Capital in the time frame that they really just started. And I think they're working incredibly hard and incredibly professionally and we are, too. And I think the process proceeded in the first quarter the same way it was going at the end of the year, and we continue to make progress together.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then maybe just lastly. Jeff, on bolt-on acquisitions, it's been a little quiet here of late. Can you update us on what's in the pipeline and potential for some smaller bolt-ons here through the course of 2012?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Terry, we may do some smaller bolt-ons, but we got a lot on our plate. I really want to get all the Energy acquisitions nailed. I just don't want to do a big deal this year. I just -- again, we never say never, but I just don't want to do a big deal this year. I really -- we've got 11% organic growth, 20% orders growth. We got gain right now and I think our focus is on good execution and delivering big backlogs, and that's really the focus of the leadership team.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On the 11% Industrial organic growth does fare pretty when well against guidance. Would you expect that's a high watermark for the year or maybe just offer some color on how you see backlog flowing through during the year.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","My hunch is that we don't have any plans to continue at that rate for the year. I think, Chris, we said 5% to 10% in the December meeting. I think we're going to be safely in that range. And again, we just see pretty good -- big backlogs, big orders and we're in some good places right now, so I think that's -- but 11% is high.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then on the second quarter review of European CRE portfolio review, do you have a taste you could offer on the outcomes you might be anticipating? It's in the context of overall valuation improvement.","Keith S. Sherin","We'll have to see. We've continued to mark our equity book where we have values that put the cash flows at less than our current book value. So I think we've got a pretty good mark on it today. But you'll have to see how the assumptions play out. Overall, we feel pretty good about Real Estate. I think we're going to be cautious. Look, we got about $8 billion of equity in real estate in Europe. So we have to go through the valuation review, take it incredibly seriously. But I think overall, you feel good about the dynamics globally.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citigroup.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Hey, on the Moody's recent recalibration of their methodology for rating finance companies, have you seen any change in your funding costs?","Keith S. Sherin","We haven't really. We've tracked it obviously from the day we were put on notice on the day that the action was taken. Our spreads continue to trade relative to banks who are higher rated and banks who are lower rated than us right in line. And over the last 10 days -- the first couple of days we saw an increase in spreads in line sort of with the market and then the last 10 days we've seen a compression of the spreads back again. I mean, overall, as you know, all the actions that we've taken in GE Capital to strengthen liquidity, lower the short-term funding risk, raise the capital, improve the risk profile of the portfolio, I think those have been pretty well recognized by the market. And the fact that the Moody's methodology just has a fundamental change in how they feel about fincos and ultimately they're going to do the same thing on banks as you've read a lot about recently. I think that the market is looking at what is the core business and underlying strength of the cash flows and the protection for the bondholders of the business. I think the actions that we've taken at GE Capital have been recognized by the market and have helped us to perform through a period where we were downgraded.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, and we agree when we looked at how the bonds initially acted at the time of the announcement, it was very minor. It was like maybe between 5 and 10 basis points and then that seems to have tightened subsequently, so it's fair to say that was a non-event.","Keith S. Sherin","We agree.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then over on the resumption of the dividend from Capital to the parent, one of the scenarios we were talking about in December was the idea that you could be in a position to make that dividend retroactive going back to January. Is that still a possibility, or how are you looking at that today?","Keith S. Sherin","Look, our objective is to have a dividend of a percentage of GE Capital's earnings that's equivalent to what we pay to our investors on the overall company stock and it would be for the year. And the timing of the reviews and everything that we have shouldn't change that. But again, we're going to have to wait until we get feedback and information from the Fed on that. Our objective hasn't changed. Our objective was to pay a 45% dividend on GE Capital's earnings for the entire year and to return excess capital above the regulatory standards including the stress cases. And it's something that, over several years, we feel really good about, the excess capital we have in financial service. But again, we got to work through this exercise, and we're doing it constructively and professionally. And as you saw the results in GE Capital in the first quarter, it continued to strengthen, so we have to see how that all goes.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And what's the expectation on the stress test? And talk a bit about the preparation that you're going through.","Keith S. Sherin","Well, we do our own stress cases a couple times a year and we're not publicizing those results. But you can expect that an enterprise like GE Capital would go through exercises similar to what you saw other large financial institutions go through, but we do it in our own way with the Fed sort of uniquely as opposed to being part and lumped together with the bank. So we're doing a lot of work. We have stress cases. We have portfolio reviews. We have reserve reviews. We have all the things that you'd expect a financial institution to have, and just we're doing it one-on-one with the Fed and it won't be disclosed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So I'm trying to figure out if we should be expecting ENI to go lower at GE Capital? I mean it's -- the problem with Real Estate getting so good now is I mean you had Real Estate turned positive in the quarter, you got the GE Capital tax rate going down 5 points with Industrial staying about where it was and you had capital like 50% of earnings. I'm trying to figure out how we get -- it doesn't seem like anything's getting worse at Capital. Everything's getting better. So how do we get that percentage down if we're not sort of doing I guess some larger asset exits?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Look, I would always say that the GE Capital's percentage of earnings in the first quarter are always high and we haven't changed our long-term outlook on where we want the split to be. And then again, we continue to execute on a plan that would get us lower than where we finished the first quarter in ENI, and we see opportunities to do that by exiting red assets and we still have opportunities there, and that's what I would expect. But at the same time, look, our net interest margin is growing. Our returns on new business, our ROI on new business was higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth quarter. So there's lots of other elements in the business that are good even as we shrink ENI.","Keith S. Sherin","I think it's a good point on -- it's one other point on ENI. When you look at the total year, we are continuing to shrink, so that is one of the things that does reduce earning assets, obviously, and earnings. And on tax, I don't think it's a straight 5 points. I think it's a couple of points in the range of what we had as mid-teens to around 10. And there's a lot of uncertainty to that, as you know, when you get to the end of the year. So that obviously is another item that could move as you go into the end of 2012 and into 2013.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Yes, I understand the point of the seasonality with some Industrial stuff stronger later in the year. But in terms of the ENI, I mean does 425 still feel like the right number or...","Jeffrey R. Immelt","No, Shannon, again I think that's kind of the -- again, these are big numbers. They're always hard to predict to a single point. My preference and the way we're trying to run the place is to get to 425 by the end of the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay, and then just on the capital allocation, can you just fill out, I guess, this investor-friendly comment a little bit in terms of when you do or assuming you do and when you do get the dividend back from Capital, I mean is buyback still sort of the priority use? I mean how should we -- maybe just frame some thoughts around how you think about ramping that once you get the green light.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Again, this is something that we'll go through with the board when that takes place. But I would say we love growing the dividend in line with earnings. We think that's great. We do -- we might do a few smaller bolt-on acquisitions in businesses we're already in. And if we get the opportunity, we'd still like to do buyback. So I think there'll be some mixture, but we certainly think buybacks are attractive to our investors and that's what it means to be investor-friendly.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. So it's sort of balanced buyback acquisitions?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Again, I hate to predict anything. But I think we believe that buybacks are investor-friendly. But I always go back to dividends, small bolt-on acquisitions and buybacks. We'll pull all 3 levers, I think, as we have surplus cash.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First, Jeff, I think you mentioned earlier when discussing orders that you thought you were gaining share in certain markets and feeling pretty good about that. Can you elaborate on where you see the most substantial market share gains?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","We never know those numbers kind of ahead of time, so each industry has its own cadence. It's just -- it's a high level versus what anybody would predict for the industries we're in. So I think we need to kind of see NEMA data and other stuff as we go through the close of the quarter and get a chance to look at some of our competitors' results.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, can you give us an update on the 737 MAX program and the engine development, how it's going there? I think there have been some concerns about how that was going given the size constraints on the 737, whether you'd be able to have an engine that was competitive enough with the A320neo.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Yes -- no, I think we like where we are. We see some additional fuel burn opportunities that we want to execute on. I just was reviewing the program a couple weeks ago out in Cincinnati. I think we've been able to take a lot of technology off the GEnx and put it into LEAP. I'd say if you sat back and said you got the 737 MAX, you've got the C919 and our share of the A320neo is probably greater than 50%. We like how the engine's positioned, and so we feel pretty good about both the technology and the commercial process on that particular -- on the narrow-body space.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Company.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","Just 2 questions, talk about Energy and Healthcare. First, on Energy, great news on the pricing. It almost defies logic not in terms of the direction and what we're looking for, being bullish on your stock, but just how quickly. How much of this is customers? And talk a little bit by region going, hey, we do need this capacity. We may have to back off a little bit to get a deal signed and how much of this, if any, is your teams being a little bit more selective and saying there's just some business that maybe we let somebody else win? And then I have a brief question on Healthcare.","Keith S. Sherin","Look, I don't think -- we're trying to compete globally everywhere, Brian, and we're -- we've got good strong competitors, especially in that thermal space. And we've got a great product in the Flex 50. We've got a great product in our heavy-duty gas turbine product line. And so we're not -- I don't think anybody's backing off anywhere. I think we're competing globally. I think one of the things that you may see relative to the historic trend is you ended up with some higher-priced capacity that's had price erosion over the last 12 to 18 months, and now we're getting to kind of a market-clearing price level. So it's not so much either walking away or supply and demand has tightened dramatically. I think you've really just had the pricing get to a level where it's probably more realistic for the main competitors in the marketplace based on the demand we see. I hope that helps a little bit.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","It does. Sounds a little bit like new normal. Then on the Healthcare side, certainly some decent performance there, especially with all the noise that's going on. Did you -- have you observed or did your team there observe any kind of a change in texture as the healthcare reform is going to the Supreme Court argument? Anything you guys saw blip-wise up or down in terms of marginal propensity to buy it through the quarter or your conversations now?","Keith S. Sherin","Really none. Again, I think the U.S. seems to have normalized. My hunch is the market's probably single digit -- low single digit up, that would be my expectation. And Brian, we really didn't see any change after the Supreme Court or anything like that. Very strong orders on the -- orders on Equipment were really strong in the U.S., as we said, up 15%, and that says that there's good technology and customers have capital and they need to continue to improve their capability. And so I think, overall, it was a very encouraging quarter.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","And that plus 15% was a fairly steady plus 15%? I mean...","Keith S. Sherin","We have -- if you want some products, CT was up 10, MRI was up 9, x-ray was up...","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","No, I mean through the quarter. I'm sorry, Kevin, like through the quarter, like...","Keith S. Sherin","No real change. Really pretty steady.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I don't know if the question was answered, but I guess I just wanted to get a little bit more info on this. Utilities continue to come out and talk about the high utilization of their plants from a gas perspective. How does that translate over the next 12 to 18 months from a Services perspective? Because it's kind of unclear to me. There's a lot of moving parts with which plants are being used, the starts and stops, whether that's more profitable for your Services business. Maybe you could just give a little bit of color on how that actually impacts the Services business at Energy.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","What I would say, Steve, is if you look over, let's say, 18 months and as this performance continues, this should be good for our Energy Power Gen Services business because, again, they run them higher, they're going to consume more parts, things like that. Now this all gets balanced between who's got shutdowns, when are the shutdowns, where are they on a CSA. There's a whole bunch of -- there's like 10 other Xs that are in that equation, but the macro point is positive. That's why I don't think we're trying to be vague. It's just hard to call a quarter, but the macro trend is good.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So was it something that can add -- instead of it growing 5% just on installed base, could it add a couple percentage points to the growth rate? I mean is it something that meaningful or is it, it all kind of blend in and kind of support the kind of mid-single-digit Services growth there?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I think what it could do is, over time, add to the growth rate. But again, I do believe that. So I just think it's just hard to predict exactly when.","Charles  Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, it's certainly not going to hurt the growth rate.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Yes, exactly.","Keith S. Sherin","That's right.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Great, Chanel. I think we're wrapped up now, is that...","Operator","That is correct. There are no further questions.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Great. Well, thank you, everyone, for today. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website.

[Operator Instructions] My name is Chanel, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Thank you, Chanel. Good morning and welcome, everyone. We're pleased to host today's fourth quarter 2011 earnings webcast. Regarding materials for this webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning, and the presentation slides are available. Slides are also available for download and printing on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today's webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO, Keith Sherin. Now I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Great, Trevor. Good morning. Thanks. Look, GE finished the year with real strength. We had the best order results in history. Many of our key end-use markets are showing momentum like Commercial Real Estate and Aviation. The emerging markets continue to be very strong. There are a few challenged markets like Europe and Appliances but on balance, we have a positive outlook. ","Company operations were strong. EPS grew by 11%. Organic growth was 5%. CFOA and liquidity were very strong. GE Capital exceeded all of their performance goals and ended with a very strong Tier 1 common ratio. We're executing a balanced capital allocation plan. We increased the dividend again in fourth quarter. Overall, the dividend grew by 21% in 2011. Our buyback for the year was 5.4 billion, including both common shares and the Berkshire preferred. ","Finally, we ended 2011 with confidence that we could deliver on our 2012 double-digit of earnings framework. So overall, a good quarter. Orders grew by 15%, which was up 9% organically. We had fairly broad-based strength. Of particular note, Energy orders were up 23%. Thermal orders were up 88% and we had orders for 50 heavy-duty gas turbines in the quarter. Orders in the emerging markets grew by 26%. We end the year with $200 billion of backlog and had an equipment book-to-bill ratio of 1.23 for the quarter. So these numbers certainly support a 5% to 10% organic growth goal for 2012.","Our investments in growth are paying off. First, on the global front, we had a 25% expansion in our Industrial growth market revenue. Our expansion was broad-based with most businesses and most regions experiencing strong growth. Services grew by 14% and expanded margins. We had strong growth across all businesses and we ended the year with $147 billion of service backlog. ","We increased R&D by 16% in 2011, resulting in multiple new product launches. In Healthcare, we launched leadership products in MR, ultrasound and interventional. Energy is growing in both the heavy-duty gas turbine market with the Flex 50 and 60, but also in the distributed energy products with solar and waste heat recovery. Aviation has positioned the LEAP-X to win and had the H80 turboprop launched to penetrate new segments. Rail is picking up global orders. We're launching a full range of Appliance products in the next 6 quarters. So overall, our organic growth should continue. ","And we made progress on margins in the quarter. We're up 250 basis points versus third quarter '11. Most of our negative rate versus fourth quarter 2010 is explained by acquisitions and R&D investment. Looking forward, we still feel good about a 50 basis point improvement in 2012. We have good productivity programs in place. We're making structural improvements and our global and R&D investments are on a run rate. We see energy pricing stabilizing as we move through 2012 and into 2013, and so margins are an important focus for our leadership team and we think we'll make progress in 2012.","In cash, we had very good, very strong cash performance. CFOA was $5.5 billion in the fourth quarter. That's a record quarter. This led to total CFOA of $12.1 billion for the year. Our working capital performance was very strong in the fourth quarter. Consolidated cash was $85 billion at year end. Our capital allocation plan was in line with expectations. We grew the dividend twice in 2011. We completed nearly $12 billion of acquisitions and bought back $5.4 billion of stock, including the Berkshire preferred. So overall, cash and capital allocation were either equal to or better than planned and we feel good about that performance.","We continue to strengthen GE Capital liquidity. We're prepared for 2012 maturities by having a substantial amount of cash on hand. We've already issued $5 billion of long-term debt. So we're off to a good start. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 11.4% for GECC and 9.9% for GECS. On a Basel III basis, we compare favorably to the banks. ","We ended 2011 with $445 billion of ending net investment, ahead of our plan. As a result, we're resetting our ending net investment goal for 2012 to between $425 billion and $440 billion. We will continue to grow in high return segments. Our expectations for GE Capital earnings are unchanged for 2012. At the same time, we expect to have lower debt issuances for the year. So looking forward, we've achieved a focused, high margin, safe GE Capital, a Financial Service business that can grow and win in this marketplace. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Keith to go through operations.","Keith S. Sherin","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter summary. We had continuing operations revenues in the quarter of $38 billion. They were down 8%. Industrial sales of $26.7 billion were reported down 7%. However, if you look at the notes at the bottom of the page, excluding the impact of not having the NBC revenues last year, GE's Industrial sales were up 11%. Financial Services revenues of 11.6% were down 9%. That was driven by our lower assets year-over-year mostly. Operating earnings of $4.1 billion were up 6% and operating earnings per share of $0.39 were up 11%, reflecting the benefit of retiring the preferred shares. ","Continuing earnings per share includes the impact of the non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations, and that reflects a $0.02 charge this year, which I'm going to cover on the next page and also on a comparison basis, the non-repeat of the net $0.06 of gains we had last year in discontinued operations. Our cash for the year of $12.1 billion was very strong. We had a great fourth quarter and the total year and Jeff covered that. ","For taxes, in the fourth quarter, our tax rates were 15% for GE, excluding GE Capital. The GE Capital rate was 4% and those rates include about $0.03 of benefit from our IRS audit resolution for the years 2006 and 2007, and I'll go into a little more detail on that on the next page. So those amounts put us right in line with our third quarter outlook for tax rates for GE and GE Capital. ","The consolidated GE rate ended the year at 29%. The GE rate, excluding GE Capital, was 38% and that includes the impact of the NBCU gain from the first quarter. If you exclude that, the GE rate was 19% for the year. That's up 2 points over last year. And the GE Capital rate for the year came in at 12% and that rate's up significantly from 2010 as a result of our significantly higher pretax income. ","As you look forward for 2012, I would estimate our GE rate to be somewhere in the low 20% range and the GE Capital rate to be somewhere in the mid-teens range for 2012. On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial revenues were up 10%. Industrial segment profit was up 2%. That was driven by Transportation and Aviation. You can see Energy was flat and that's a big improvement versus the 3Q year-to-date results.  Healthcare was down slightly and Home & Business Solutions continue to be negatively impacted by the housing market. Down at the bottom, GE Capital had another strong quarter with earnings up 58% and I'm going to go into each of the segments in more detail in a few pages. ","Before I get to the businesses, I will start with the other items page. As we mentioned during third quarter, we were in negotiation for final resolution of the 2006, 2007 tax years with the IRS. We did reach a resolution on several tax matters for those 2 years that resulted in $0.03 of benefit in the fourth quarter. And in terms of geography, $0.01 of that was in Industrial and $0.02 of that were recorded in GE Capital. So overall, a $0.03 benefit at the end of the year from that resolution.","We also had some one-time costs in Q4. We had a little more than $0.02 related to restructuring. We reduced the cost structure in Energy, Healthcare and GE Capital. We also had almost $0.01 of one-time costs related to this year's acquisitions as we've had throughout the year. So if you look at where these were recorded, the charges were recorded at corporate. On an after-tax basis, we have $78 million in Energy, $58 million in Healthcare, $28 million in GE Capital and then Aviation, H&BS, Transportation and corporate all had about $15 million of restructuring as we work on lowering our cost base as we go into 2012. ","On the bottom of the page, we did an update on Grey Zone reserves in the fourth quarter. While the claims have declined significantly from the peak that we saw in the first quarter of 2011, we did see an uptick in September. Then we saw declines in October through December. Based on the 2011 activity, we've updated our long-term claims reduction assumption. We had set this at 4% in the third quarter of 2010 and we reduced it this quarter by about 1 point. So if you include the current claim severity as well as the claims assumption adjustment, it resulted in a $243 million addition to the reserves in the fourth quarter.  We end the year with $692 million of reserves and we expect the claims to continue to decline. The December claims were down and we will have to obviously monitor and communicate where we are in Grey Zone going forward, but the trends feel good based on where we are at the end of the fourth quarter. ","One other point that is not on the page as we discussed in the first quarter earnings, we did have 6 more days in Q1 2011 versus Q1 2010 and that's just based on our fiscal calendar. That helped us by about $0.01 EPS in the first quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had the opposite effect. We had 6 fewer days in the fourth quarter of '11 versus '10 and that impact was about $1 billion of lower revenue and about $0.01 less EPS in the fourth quarter and so we also absorbed that impact. ","Next, I want to cover 2 reporting updates for you. On the left side, we're in the process of merging GE Capital Services into GE Capital Corporation, so that we end up with one SEC registrant for Financial Services. Basically, the current reporting for GE Capital Services will become the going-forward reporting for all of GE Capital Corporation. Those results at GE Capital Services will be the segment GE Capital that we use with investors that will be what Mike Neal and the team run. There won't be 2 organizations. We think this is a big simplification. It will be effective for the first quarter earnings and we're going to file an 8-K today outlining this merger. So there's no change in the fourth quarter or how we're reporting GE Capital until the first quarter and going forward, we'll have one consistent Financial Services entity. So I look forward to getting to just reporting GE Capital and having it be the total enterprise. ","On the right side, we completed an internal reorganization in October. We moved the responsibility for the measurement and controls business run by Brian Palmer over to Dan Heintzelman in the Oil & Gas business. You can see the financial size here, $4 billion of revenue, $600 million of op profit on a total year basis and the details of this move are in the supplemental materials that we released this morning. We moved this business because it reflects the customer alignment for the M&CS business. It's much more aligned with the Oil & Gas base. It's going to give us more scale. In the solutions business for Oil & Gas, there is no change to the overall Energy Infrastructure segment. So this is just between Energy and Oil & Gas within the segment. And today, on the results that we'll show you, I'll give you both the before and after, so you can clearly see this impact. ","So 2 organization changes and I'll move on to the business results. First is Energy Infrastructure. The fourth quarter was a mixed performance. We had a terrific orders quarter, as Jeff talked about and I'll give you more details. Revenue was also very strong, but it was less than our September forecasts. We had some wind units and we had some equipment installations pushed into 2012. We also had some impact that was worse than we expected in September from the stronger dollar. ","Segment profit, while it was significantly better than the first 3 quarters, it was slightly less than the growth we expected and I'll cover that by business. I'm going to cover the details for Energy and Oil & Gas on the new basis as I've just covered. So you can see that down on the bottom left. However, the pre-reorganization basis is also shown on the bottom left and as I said, the supplemental data has all the details. So what I'm going to go through now is on the basis with M&CS moved into Oil & Gas. ","I'll start with Energy. We had another quarter of great orders growth. Orders of $11 billion were up 19%. Equipment orders at $6 billion were up 33%. They're even up 24%, excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Renewable orders at $2 billion were up 53%. We had orders for 1,023 wind turbines versus 477 a year ago. Thermal orders of $1.9 billion were up 88%. We received orders for 50 gas turbines versus 29 last year. That's a great quarter for gas turbines. ","Equipment orders price was down 4.4%. Renewables pricing was down 4.9%. Thermal pricing was down 12.5%. If you look at the combined thermal and Power Gen Services orders price impact, it was down 5.5% and service pricing was flat. Service orders in the quarter $5 billion were up 6%. When you look at the top line, revenue of $9.2 billion was up 11%. That's driven by the strong volume we had and the acquisition benefit. Organic revenue in Energy was up 6%. ","Equipment revenue of $5 billion was up 15%. That was driven by renewables, so $1.6 billion was up 15%. We shipped 688 wind turbines versus 592 last year. That was a little short of our goal if you look at what we put out for the third quarter. As we expected for the total year, we had some slip. End market revenue was up 57%. Aero revenue was up 14% and that growth was partially offset by thermal revenues of $1.3 billion. It was down 3%. We had higher volume of gas turbines, 33 this year versus 18 last year, but that was more than offset by having lower balance of plant revenue, items that are produced by other parties that we don't make, but we include the project and also the lower pricing. ","Service revenue, about $4.1 billion was up 7%. And for the quarter, segment profit of $1.7 billion was down 3% as the benefits of the higher volume and material deflation were more than offset by lower pricing and negative unit mix. Now while being down 3% is a great improvement over the third quarter year-to-date results of down 20%, the main drag continued to be our wind business, which accounted for $41 million of the $44 million year-over-year op profit decrease. And I'll cover some more of the dynamics on the wind business for 2012 on the next page. ","For Oil & Gas, orders of $4.7 billion were up 34%. Equipment orders of $2.4 billion were up 40%, driven by the acquisitions, plus strong refinery and petrochemical orders. Service orders of $2.3 billion were up 29% on strong drilling and production activity. Oil & Gas orders price index was a positive 2\/10 in the quarter. ","Revenue of $4.1 billion was up 38%, again driven by the impact of the acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, the revenue was up 6%. Segment profit of $630 million was up 12%. That's driven by the acquisitions plus strong volume, partially offset by negative productivity across the business. So overall, when you look at Energy Infrastructure, a significantly improved earnings profile as we exit 2011.","Now I thought it\u2019d be helpful to give you a little more detail on the Energy plan for 2012. On this chart, we ended the year with $6.7 billion of op profit. Our plan is to grow double digit 2012 and you can see the drivers on the right side.  First, we have an incredibly strong equipment backlog. Energy equipment orders of $25.5 billion were up 39% last year. We're planning on double-digit growth in the equipment deliveries and you can see the huge growth in wind and aero volume down on the bottom left that's in the business plan for 2012. ","For services, our service orders were $22.8 billion, up 9% for 2011. Our service backlog stands at $50 billion. So we should expect a good services year in Energy. We invested a lot in new products and in growth. We\u2019ve peaked in terms of our program and growth investments as a percent of revenue. So that's not going to be a drag on margins for Energy and we'll get a full year of the acquisition earnings. ","So those 4 factors more than offset the price pressure that we already have in the backlog and that we've talked about quite a bit. So the Energy teams work through the toughest part of the earnings cycle, mainly driven by the 2011 wind margin declines and we're looking forward to delivering double-digit earnings growth in 2012.","Next is Aviation. The Aviation team had another solid quarter in the fourth quarter. Orders of $6.9 billion were up 18%. Commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion were up 67%, driven by the GE90. Military engine orders of $402 million were up 53%, driven by foreign military orders. Equipment orders price was up 1.9% and we ended the quarter with a backlog of $22.5 million, up 12% versus last year. Service orders of $2.7 billion were down 9%. Military services were down 41%, driven by lower F110 spares. And Commercial Services were up 1%, driven by higher overall activity -- overhaul activity, partially offset by a lower spares rate. ","The fourth quarter spares order rate was $22.3 million a day, down 11% and that reflects the aggressive purchasing that we saw in the third quarter in advance of the November price increase. If you look at the total year average daily order rate for our spares, it was $24.7 million, up 13% over 2010 and the team feels very confident about the current spares rate and how they're doing in the marketplace commercially. ","Revenue of $4.9 billion, that was up 2%, driven by equipment, up 3% and services, up 2%. We shipped 518 commercial engines in the quarter. That was down 7 engines from last year, but revenues were up 10% on more GE90 units, and we shipped 34 GEnx units in the quarter. Segment profit of $850 million was up 4%. That's driven by the strong volume and the positive value gap in the business. ","On the right side, Transportation. The Transportation team continued delivering strong results in the fourth quarter. Orders of $1.2 billion were down 11%. That's driven by the tough comparisons. Equipment orders of $500 million were down 43% because of no repeat of last year's $550 million multiyear orders. So the orders still in the backlog, but it's a tough comparison.  Service orders of $739 million were up 57%. That's driven by the growth in our long-term service agreements and orders pricing for Transportation was up 1.2%. Revenue in the quarter, $1.5 billion was up 43%, driven by all the strong volume. We shipped 210 locomotives domestically versus 86 in the fourth quarter last year. We shipped 48 international units versus 30 last year and mining revenues were also up almost 40% on higher volume. Service revenues were up over 30% on strong long-term agreement. Performance and segment profit of $226 million was up more than 200%, driven by all that strong volume and the services delivery.","Next is Healthcare. We did see a slowdown in the developed markets in Q4 for Healthcare. Orders of $5.2 billion were flat. Equipment orders of $3.2 billion were up 1%. Diagnostic Imaging overall globally was down 2%. Clinical Systems was up 5%. Life Sciences was up 3%.  If you go by geography, U.S. Equipment was down 7% and non-U.S. Equipment was up 6% and here are some of the pieces. Europe was down 13%. That was the toughest market. China was up 29%. India was up 20%. Latin America was up 6%. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 1% and the total orders price for the business was down 1.9%. ","Revenue of $5.2 billion was up 1%. That was really driven by the emerging markets, which were up 16%, partially offset by the declines in Europe and the U.S. Segment profit of $953 million was down 5% as the benefits of the higher volume and productivity were more than offset by negative pricing and the continued investments we're making in the new business like Intel Home Health JV and also new products. ","On the right side of the page, H&BS had another tough quarter. Revenues of $2.2 billion were down 4%. Segment profit of $82 million was down 41%. These results were driven by appliances. The domestic market was down 12% units in the quarter. We gained 7\/10 point of share in the quarter, but the inflation we saw was only partially offset by pricing, resulting in the overall segment profit decline. Lighting revenues were down 1%, driven by Europe and Intelligent Platforms revenues were up 4%, driven by strong software growth.","And let me shift to GE Capital. Mike Neal and the Capital team had a really good quarter. Revenues of $10.7 billion were down 9%, in line with our NE shrinkage, plus the impact of the fewer days. Pretax and after-tax earnings continue to rebound.  On the right side, asset quality metrics showed continued improvements or stability. We had $49 billion of volume in the quarter, which was up 13% from Q3. Our margins came in at 5.4% for the year. We continue to beat our ending investment targets and there's a lot more information about GE Capital in the supplemental charts on reserve coverage in non-earnings that we posted this morning. ","So just a few highlights by business. I'll start with Consumer. The Consumer business had another positive earnings quarter. We ended the year with assets of $139 billion. That was down 6%. Net income of $575 million was up 5% and that was driven by the improved credit costs.  U.S. Retail Finance had a great quarter. They earned $463 million, which was up 29%, driven by some acquisitions. We added some portfolios and also lowered credit costs. The U.S. Retail Finance volume was strong. It was up 3% over last year and it was up 14% versus the third quarter.  For Europe, we had net income of $111 million. That was down 35%, but it was driven by not having the Garanti earnings that we used to have since we sold our stake there. ","We also had $63 million of after-tax impairments on our Greek bonds and that brings the net book value of our Greek holdings down to about $74 million. Our U.K. Home Lending business earned $89 million in the quarter, good performance on asset quality. 30-day delinquencies were down 97 basis points versus Q3. Our owned real estate stock was down to 461 houses, and that's the lowest we've had since 2005. And on the houses that we did repossess and sold, we realized 115% of the carrying value on our sales in the fourth quarter, so pretty good marks and valuation. ","Next is Real Estate. Commercial Real Estate had another quarter with significant improvements over last year. Assets of $61 billion were down $12 billion or 16% versus last year and they were also down $4 billion or 6% versus the third quarter. So we continue to work this book down. The business ended Q4 with $153 million of losses after tax. That was $256 million better than last year. ","During the quarter, we incurred $64 million of after-tax credit costs and $168 million of after-tax marks and impairments. And also during the quarter, a bright spot I'd say, we sold 157 properties for $1.9 billion, realizing $132 million in after-tax gains. So there -- as you see in the press, there is more liquidity in the commercial real estate market, and our business is benefiting from that.  As Jeff mentioned on the front page, our unrealized loss on the equity portfolio was down to $2.6 billion and the outlook is that Real Estate is going to continue to deliver a strong improved performance in 2012. ","Commercial Lending & Leasing also had another strong quarter. Assets of $194 billion were down 4% due to the run-off of some non-core assets and dispositions. Net income of $777 million was up 37%. That's driven by lower losses and higher core income.  Americas\u2019 net income of $570 million was up 42%, driven by lower credit costs and that's their best quarter that they've had in 4 years. Europe and Asia were both down a bit, driven by lower assets. ","GECAS. GECAS fourth quarter is actually better than it looks. You can see here net income of $315 million is reported down 27%, but that included the impact last year of $167 million of tax benefits from the IRS settlement we had last year in the fourth quarter. There were no such benefits allocated to GECAS this year.  So if you look on a normalized basis, net earnings would have been about 19% up, driven by continued improvements in core margin. Asset quality remained strong here. We ended the quarter -- ended the year with 2 aircraft on the ground, so another good year for GECAS.  ","And Energy Financial Services also had a strong quarter. Earnings of $110 million were up 234%, driven by higher core income and higher gains. So overall, another very strong performance by GE Capital, and let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Hey, great, Keith. Thanks. For 2012, we're confirming our earnings framework. Strong orders and rebounding margins support double-digit industrial growth. Better margins, improving commercial real estate and lower losses support double-digit capital growth. Corporate cost and CFOA are in line with our December meeting. Industrial organic growth is well-positioned to expand by 5% to 10%. Capital revenue will be below our December meeting based on lower ENI. So we close here with momentum towards these results and goals that we have for 2012.","To conclude, we're positioned, I think, for strong execution in '12. Organic growth looks solid with a $200 billion backlog. Margins are improving, fueled by productivity programs and cost actions. Our industrial returns will exceed 15%. We're positioned to deliver on the 2 areas most important to investors, double-digit industrial earnings growth with higher margins and double-digit capital earnings growth with the goal of restarting the GE Capital dividend to GE. So it's a good quarter, could have been even better and that's encouraging for 2012. So I like our momentum and really, we feel good about where we are and what we can get done in 2012. ","So, Trevor, with that, let's -- back over to you.","Trevor A. Schauenberg","Thanks, Jeff, and Keith. Chanel, we're ready to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis from Barclays Capital.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, can you talk about your confidence in your margin guide in Energy? And you've been talking about 50 basis points, but you put up a pretty big 4Q, which raises the base for 2011 and then you also raised your gas turbine shipments from 130 -- well, you were at 128 last quarter, now you're saying 137. So your mix shift is turning a little bit more negative and your base is higher. So just talk about that 50 basis points because that's a pretty big movement in our model.","Keith S. Sherin","Well, I think I'll take a shot at it and let Jeff also add to it, Scott. I think if you look at the drag that we've had in Energy this year and the drag that we've had for the whole company, it's been driven by our investments in R&D and global. And as we've said, we've taken that and we\u2019ve got it in the run rate and that's not going to continue to be a drag. That was -- for the fourth quarter, it was 0.09 point on the whole company and for Energy, it was a similar result. The second drag that we've had in 2010 that you'd expect were the acquisitions. We've acquired these companies. We've only started to really integrate them. We don't have a full year. That was 0.5 point of drag on the company in the fourth quarter and our expectation is that we continue to get improvements in those acquisitions. We've got a lot of people working on both the top line and the operating synergies, and so that is another factor that we've got to work. And then finally, the one drag that was just on the whole company all year long was wind. On the totally year, it was 0.8 point for the whole company. And as you can see, our wind expectation is that we're going to have a significant amount of volume. It's certainly not going to be an operating profit dollar drag like we saw in 2011. I mean, it was close to $700 million of operating profit drag dollars in 2011 on this business. We don't expect anything like that. We expect actually to have an improvement in the wind performance in 2012 and we're going to have to work the mix issue associated with that, but there's a lot of good factors. The services business has an incredible backlog. We've got to execute in businesses like the Oil & Gas business on large projects, so make sure we don't have any cost or quality issues or things like that and the whole team is focused on it. So it's important to us. It's important to investors. We have some good factors that don't repeat from 2011 that were headwinds that don't repeat as headwinds, but we need to execute. There's no question about it, Scott.","Scott R. Davis - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, Keith, for you, I'm calc-ing out about $10 billion of potential dry powder you'll have in 2012 to either buy back stock or do deals or dividend, whatever kind of you guys decide. I mean, I guess, first -- my first question is kind of does that $10 billion kind of pass your sniff test and b, have your priorities to deploy that cash changed at all since your Analyst Day in December?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, I think 2012, we expect to have growth in cash flow from our Industrial business. As you know, we ended the year at $12 billion. We expect that to grow in 2012. We already have increased the dividend for 2012 as you saw. Our expectation is that we're going to have a balanced capital allocation plan between buyback and M&A. We're going to look at opportunities and see what we do. I think to get to a number like you're talking about, we really do need, first of all, the capital dividend. And we would expect that over time, we're going to get excess capital out of capital, not just the 45% earnings and we have to get some of that. Other thing that I would say is right now, we're still planning on keeping about $8 billion of cash at the parent. We ended the year a little bit above that number just from a safe and secure and how we manage the company for all sorts of unforeseen risks. So I'd factor that into your math, but we expect to have a good cash year and have a good capital allocation year.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I think we'll have available cash in line with what we said in December. We've got a $200 billion backlog. We don't need -- really, we don't need acquisitions. I wouldn't look for us to do a big acquisition. We've got a pretty full pipeline of new products and so I think the emphasis on dividend reducing the float over time, those take a very high priority.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So you guys gave us the service margin of 28.5%. I think you've given us kind of a number that's close to that in the past. I don't know what that margin refers to. There's a lot of different numbers that you refer to when you say margin. But backing into what the equipment margin is kind of gets me to a low single-digit number. Is that correct way to look at it?","Keith S. Sherin","Yes, equipment margins are in that range.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Historically, how high have those margins gotten? Obviously, exclude the gas turbine bubble, they have been higher historically, correct?","Keith S. Sherin","Sure. When you're -- if we can get to those kind of levels, the incremental margin associated with the gas turbine business was fantastic back in the late...","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, I guess, excluding that, though.","Keith S. Sherin","Well, I think if we -- right now, you're looking at a thermal business that is -- the market actually is pretty good globally. 50 gas turbine orders in the fourth quarter is pretty good, but there's still excess capacity. I think if you see a tightening in that market, you're going to be able to get incremental margins on the equipment side. I think that's going to be a good factor for us. But right now, you're still seeing, obviously, price erosion when you look at the orders price index that we have, but the commitment levels that we're seeing are starting to stabilize. And I think Jeff said that'll roll into the end of '12 and into '13 at much better margins for us from an equipment perspective.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","And, Scott, we ought to get improving equipment margins as part of the 50 basis points improvement in 2012 versus 2011.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. So longer term, you've got $60 billion-ish of revenue that's really sitting there dramatically kind of under-earning at this stage, given the level of volume you're doing?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I think there's another -- if you look, there\u2019s another factor maybe to think about is Aviation. We're really in the early launch phases around the GEnx and that will continue to improve as well. We got to get up to the run rate in terms of the number of engines. But clearly, the launch engines are the worse ones in terms of cost plus price and we're going to work our way into in a different place in Aviation, and GEnx will probably be one of the bigger factors.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And then one more question just on Consumer. It was kind of down sequentially. Is that just some Europe headwind kind of flowing through? And I know the provision was also up a little bit on the GE Capital income statement.","Keith S. Sherin","Yes, I think there -- the main thing in the quarter for consumer that I think about was the Greek bond impairment was in the Consumer segment.","C. Stephen Tusa - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Because delinquencies, non-earnings all kind of continue to head in the right direction.","Keith S. Sherin","Yes, I think the main point we had in the quarter --  3Q to 4Q would be the Greek bonds. The asset quality performance was good, and you do put up a little bit of provision as we had asset growth, Steve, for 3Q to 4Q.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a first question on the reorganization of GECS and GECC into GE Capital. When you think about how the Fed is looking at -- or when you think about how you would think about sort of what makes sense in terms of the right entity, we've talked about the difference in coverage and reserves for GECC versus GECS. Is there any reason to believe this wouldn't make it more likely that GECS would be the entity to look at as opposed to GECC?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, exactly. And I think all we're doing is sort of a reverse merger, Steve. If you look at what we're doing is we're putting GECS back under GECC. So the total now will be GECS. And if you look at our current reporting when you see things like Tier 1 capital at 9.9% for GE Capital Services, going forward, that will be 9.9% for GE Capital. We're going to have one entity and it's going to be the top level, but we're going to call it GE Capital.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So this essentially removes even the possibility that GECC would have been something that regulators might have considered?","Keith S. Sherin","That's right. I think at the end of the day, our expectations were, and it hasn't been finally decided, were that the total Financial Services assets of the company would be regulated. And this isn't something the Fed made us do, but I think it does simplify everything and make it clearer for investors.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And you said this is not something that was based on input from regulators?","Keith S. Sherin","That's correct.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","No, this goes back almost 20 years, Steve, and it's just -- I think it just simplifies it for our equity investors and for our bondholders.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And you talked about lower debt issuance. Can you quantify that a little bit?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Well, we'll have to see how we go through the year. We gave a range of $425 million to $440 million. As we go through the year, we'll look at the composition. Will we be able to -- I want to see how the long-term debt markets look. We want to look at CP. We'll look at alternative funding. It's going to depend upon those factors. But in total, if you got all the way down to the $425 million, you'd expect to have a combination of lower CP and long-term financing. And the margins, Steve, are still good. The earning power is still good. I think what we've said to you guys is we've got more than $70 billion of what we call red assets. The market in the U.S. is healthy for that kind of stuff. So I think that's -- we're just confident that -- in our earnings power and the ENI progress, I think, is a good thing for investors.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just one final one. 15 months ago or so when you took the last Shinsei reserve, I think we all asked the question of how do we know that, that was the right number and that, that was sort of it and we talked about frequency and severity. How do we know that this is the right number and that this is it?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, it's our best estimate. You're right. We're dealing with a tail of a liability here that's got a lot of volatility. I think the Takefuji bankruptcy wasn't something that we foresaw when we put up that reserve 15 months ago. This is our first adjustment in 15 months. We've done a lot of statistical analysis and we've got a dedicated team on the ground managing these claims. It is our best estimate as of today based on the information we have on both claims volume and severity and we're just going to have to continue to watch it. I think...","Jeffrey R. Immelt","And the claims volume is heading down. The claims volume is going down and December was better than what we had forecast, a little bit. But it's just such a long-tail liability and we're just going to have to watch it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You talk about, Keith, you talk about some push-outs in engine, I think,  mainly in winds. Can you maybe just quantify that versus the September plan? And is there any evidence that there's more project push-outs?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, from September, when we laid out the Energy goals and where we were heading into the year, I'd say there's a number of factors that affected our Energy revenue. We had about $400 million that I would put in the push-out category. About half of that is wind. We had wind units in Canada that didn't get the revenue that we thought we were going to get that will come in '12. And we also had some push-outs on installations for about another 200. So there's about $400 million of things that we didn't record that we thought we were going to and that moved into the next year. We had about $200 million from FX from the beginning of the quarter. The dollar was much stronger than we thought, so that impacted a little bit versus our September estimate. And we had some weakness in our industrial systems business, more than we thought, probably another $100 million. So those are kind of the things that we see versus where we were in September in the Energy business.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. No, that's really helpful. And then on the Energy pricing, it looks like it ticked down again versus 3Q. I think 3Q was down 1.8% and last quarter, it was down 4.4%, I think, you said, Keith?","Keith S. Sherin","Say the numbers you had again.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I think it was 1.8% last quarter on Energy equipment orders pricing, and this quarter, it was 4.4%?","Keith S. Sherin","Yes. That's correct.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Does that make the goal of keeping Energy margins flat next year more difficult?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Well, we've considered that and what we put together is our plan. I think the team does have to manage through that margin pressure as we showed you on the chart for 2012. We're going to have to have good execution on inflation and deflation and global sourcing. We've got to grow our service business, and we've got to have good cost of quality and execution on our projects, but we have factored that in. I mean, our guys when we put the plan together, that's not worse than what we're expecting, but it is pressure, obviously, in 2012 and we think we've accounted for it. This is a big deal, getting Energy up to positive margins. So just like Scott said and what you said, I mean, this is something the team is really focused on.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sure. And then finally, obviously, the dealings and what you can [ph] say about the Fed's review, but it sounds like they started off, understanding the business and understanding the funding model, can you just may be give some color in terms of where they're focusing right now?","Keith S. Sherin","Sure. They've been with us for around 6 months now, the Fed. I think without any specifics, they're working on the things you'd expect them to be working on. They're looking at our risk systems and risk teams, our risk models. They're looking at our capital levels. They're looking at our liquidity and our liquidity risk management. They're -- we're working cooperatively with them. We're in a dialogue. They know we\u2019d like to restart the dividend, and we have a process going on to review what they need to be able to help make a decision on that and it's going at their pace, I would say. So it's a lot of work. It's a ton of oversight and we're committed to working constructively with them. And at the end of the day, as soon as we can give you more information about that, we will.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Our macro benchmarks look pretty good, I mean, when you look at our Tier 1 capital ratios and things like that. So I think we're pleased with how we finished the year. We're pleased with the operating results at GE Capital and ultimately, that's the proof of the pudding, ultimately. So that's what we want to focus on. We're in a process that we just don't control it. We're working as hard as we can and we'll give you as much as we can when we can.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes, my first question was in terms of the Energy business, you and Alstom have both had decent orders in that for the December quarter. Their outlook's fairly positive for March as well. But looking at your gas turbine volumes, you had an acceleration in the decline in thermal pricing in Q4 versus Q3. So I wondered if there's a sense in which, although on the surface, sort of infrastructure projects are going ahead, you're actually finding that there are some delays going on and so you priced maybe slightly more cheaper than normal just to make sure you got decent volumes in Q4 in terms of order intake because I think your thermal pricing was down in Q3 on the order side about 7 or 8, and now it\u2019s down around 12.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Julian, some of this is just geographic mix of where the orders come from. I think doubting [ph] tends to be slightly lower priced and there was some big orders there in the quarter, stuff like that. But again, I'd go back to what we said in the past, which is first, we start with commitments, then we go to orders. I'd say the pricing in commitments seems to be stabilizing. That tends to be the leading indicator of pricing, But I think the difference between Q3 and Q4 is as much mix driven as it is any more intensity in the marketplace. And as Keith said earlier, there's a lot of interest. There's a lot of interest in gas turbines, really, on a global basis. Of the 50 orders that we took in Q4, I think only 2 were in the U.S., something like that. So I mean, we haven't even really seen much out of the U.S. yet. So I'd say the commitment is a good leading indicator for '13 and what we're seeing in '12 is no different than what we really expected.","Julian Mitchell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, on Healthcare. The profits are down there and I was intrigued to see the U.S., the comments around the U.S. being fairly weak. And I guess Philips said the U.S. was good for them, obviously, with a very weak Europe though. So I guess, how confident are you that Healthcare profits can grow in '12 given you've got quite a high revenue growth base from the first half of 2011? And obviously, there's sort of persistent price deflation just by nature in the Healthcare market.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","When you look at the market in Q3, which is the last time we really have Neiman [ph] data, it was, I think, flat to up a couple points. We gained...","Keith S. Sherin","About 3 points.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","A couple of points of share or 3 points a share in Q3. So we haven't really seen the market data yet in the U.S. Our expectation for the U.S. market is kind of flattish in 2012 and that's kind of what we're building -- have built our plan around. We're going to restructure Europe, which has already begun. We've got excellent emerging market revenue growth, which I think is both profitable and kind of fuels the earnings and then Life Sciences remain strong. So our target for Healthcare is revenue in the single-digit range and earnings in the single-digit range for next year and we didn\u2019t see anything as we closed the year that says that shouldn't be where the goals remain.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan from Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","So can I ask you to fill out, I guess, the 50 gas turbines orders a little more? You said a big Saudi, very little U.S., maybe just a little bit more how that shakes out and what you're seeing in the different global markets? And do you expect that mix to change in '12?","Keith S. Sherin","Boy, it's incredibly spread out, Shannon. We had 4 in Australia, 1 in Canada, 4 in China, 1 in Colombia, 6 in Egypt, 5 in Iraq, 1 in Japan, 1 in Korea, 2 in Russia, 13 in Saudi Arabia. I mean, it's just spread out. It's global activity and our teams are covering it. I think, Shannon, gas is really the fuel of choice. I would say that with more confidence today than even in the past and the U.S. hasn't really started yet. So someday, there's going to be a U.S. market.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And how about just a little bit more on Europe? I mean you mentioned seeing more weakness in December. I mean what's the pace of weakening that you're seeing? Are you seeing sort of things accelerate to the downside or maybe a little color on what you're seeing over the last 6 weeks or so?","Keith S. Sherin","I think the one that you really saw it directly was in Healthcare. Europe was soft. Our orders in Healthcare were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Our revenues were down 7%. That's consistent with the framework Jeff talked about in Healthcare. But when you're dealing with governments and reimbursements and austerity programs, that's probably what we expect to see. Across GE Capital, we actually had pretty good performance. Our asset quality metrics across Europe, across both commercial and Consumer business has improved. In the quarter on delinquency, 30-day delinquencies and non-earnings, so the team there continues to do a job managing their books. So I think Healthcare is the one we saw. We saw a little bit in industrial systems, but not more than what we expected.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I don't think Europe was really worse than what we expected. I think we're preparing for a recession, and that's what we expect. And I think encouragingly, it looks like there's more liquidity in the market now than there probably was even 30 days ago, but we'll see how it all shakes out. We're ready for a tough environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Investment Research.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was hoping we could circle back to the newer lower target for ENI at GE Capital. And I know that's a welcome news on a risk management standpoint and you hinted about it in the December meeting. The fact you're not lowering any of the framework for GE Capital suggests that you -- some of this progress on cutting the balance sheet debt would come from the non-core assets and, Jeff, you hinted as, said there's more open or willing market for that. Could you just take us through where the cutting and the reduction might come from in the timeframe?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","First thing I would say, the revenue for Capital in '12, again, with lower ENI will probably be down. And it's always hard to forecast revenue in GE Capital, but that's the one correction I'd make. I think earnings, we think, are still on track. But I think one of the big ones is what Keith talks about in Commercial Real Estate. I mean there's just a lot more liquidity for Commercial Real Estate. I think the guys were down for the year almost more than $10 billion in ENI for the year. So I think you could see that very well in Commercial Real Estate. And then I think there's just some other portfolios that are small in the U.S. that we think are going to be able to whittle away at the red assets. At the same time, incoming margins remain good and we've got a good origination team. So we think we can grow where we want to grow and continue to execute on the red asset plan.","Keith S. Sherin","The plan we laid out, Deane, as Jeff said, was to lower the red assets. If you look at 2011, our ending net investment on a reported basis was down $26 billion. It's down $32 billion if you include things that end up getting transferred into disc operations, discontinued operations and is taken out of the original number. So $32 billion last year of shrinkage, $27 billion of that came from what we considered red assets and we still got $80 billion of red assets. So I think the team is going to continue to run that off and we're going to continue to invest in the green assets. And just based on the fact that we're $20 billion ahead of plan on the anti-shrinkage plan, our reality is probably in 2012, we're going to be smaller.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Is there any change in the expected contribution from GE Capital to earnings, still that 30% to 40% and likely at the lower end?","Keith S. Sherin","I'd keep it there for now, yes. I mean the fourth quarter was about 40%. That's where we are right now on a run rate kind of, so you've got to -- we'll have to see how we do in 2012, but we're not changing that target.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","I'd keep it there for now. Again, I'd come back, Deane, and say the strategic priority, job one for the GE team in 2012 is to grow the Industrial earnings more than 10% and that, in the end, is kind of a laser-like focus that we've got and I like the backlog we have to do it with.","Deane M. Dray - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. Just last question for me is on cash flow. A bit stronger than what we were looking for in the fourth quarter. We had expected a little bit more of a working capital build. Were the push-outs the reason you didn't have to do that? Or just true that up for us, if you could.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Well, probably, the -- your expectation came with the fact that through the 3 quarters, we had built some inventory and we had a little more working capital than we wanted in our plan. And we did a -- the teams did a great job in the fourth quarter drawing down that inventory. Our working capital use for the year was only $700 million on double-digit revenue growth and we increased our turnover by 0.10 point. So the teams did do a good job on working capital and I think it was -- we were behind at the end of third quarter year-to-date, and we caught up and actually exceeded where we're expected to be in the fourth quarter. So progress was down a little over $1 billion and we only used $700 million of working capital while growing the Industrial business 14%. It was a pretty good year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted just to continue down this path of changes to the 2012 outlook at the margin relative to December and maybe start over on the Capital side. Keith, I wonder, did the pre-provision performance at Capital in the fourth quarter, how did that perform versus your expectations?","Keith S. Sherin","Capital came in a little better than we wanted in total. I don't have any specifics around pre-provision that came to mind in getting ready for today, Terry.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And so in terms of the deltas...","Keith S. Sherin","I hope it's specific [ph] to what you're looking for.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, just in terms of the deltas for '12, I mean, beyond the faster turnover of the red assets, areas for upside, for the capital framework, I'm curious about.","Keith S. Sherin","Sure. If you look at -- there really hasn't been a change in the fourth quarter in that. As Jeff said, the only change would be we'll probably have revenue be a little lower, but you look the margins are good. We're going to have continued significant improvements in Real Estate. That's our expectation. Losses will be slightly better. They're close to the run rate. Those will be some of the bigger drivers that we expect in 2012.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I'll take a shot at this, one more shot at this Energy horse here. The lower U.S. natural gas prices impact on your short-cycle Oil & Gas business, I know it's not a big part of the company, but pretty high margins there. What are you seeing in terms of that risk element?","Keith S. Sherin","No, I haven't seen anything specifically. The lower natural gas prices make an attractive fuel, obviously...","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe more on the drilling side.","Keith S. Sherin","Well, the drilling and production, we've had tremendous service orders that I saw in the quarter. I didn't see anything unusual in the equipment side.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On the equipment side, that's helpful.","Keith S. Sherin","We're still working on integrating everything we did with Wood Group and that gives us much more presence on the land-based drilling and production, but I didn't see anything unusual in the order base.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just a couple points of clarification. On your comments on the Fed review, obviously, tough to characterize. But I guess can one interpret that as timing, perhaps, has shifted a little further out in terms of when you might anticipate things coming to a conclusion there? Is that fair?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, what did we want? We wanted to do the dividend starting with the year and as a result of being with the Fed, we haven't been able to do that and it's really just something we don't control. I really haven't ever laid out a timing and they haven't given us a timing. We just are going to continue to work with them. Our goal is to do the dividend in 2012. We haven't changed that goal and we think we're going to be able to achieve what we said, but the timing is -- we haven't given one and it hasn't changed for us. We're just working with them constructively.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, any other items you want to call out for people to note with regards to the 1Q year-over-year comparisons? You called out the days issues. That's pretty clear. Anything else that you want to call out there? For instance, you saw only $0.03 of restructuring in 4Q, you're talking about a range of $0.03 to $0.04. Do you have a heavier restructure in the fourth -- in the first quarter of '12 over '11? Any other items like that you want call out?","Keith S. Sherin","I think if I look at first quarter alone, I don't see anything unusual in this year's first quarter '11. If you look at last year, you've got to remember, we had the NBCU gain and then in Capital, we had the large gain from the Garanti sale. So I think those are things that we're working through, comparing to. But in this year, I don't have anything that I would call out.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just a little more detail on Energy pricing if we could. Jeff, could you elaborate a little bit on your comment about things firming up in commitments? And when would you expect price on orders to inflect? Do you think that is a second half '12 event?","Jeffrey R. Immelt","So again, Jeff, I think the -- when we look at commitments, the pricing has stabilized. That tends to be, let's say, anywhere from a 6-month to an 18-month cycle. So I think the lead indicators suggest that the equipment pricing, as it goes into orders is going to start stabilizing, and then it goes from orders to revenue. So that's not necessarily a different scenario than what we've talked about in the past, I don't think.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Right. And, Keith, I may have missed it, but can you give us the price in revenues in the quarter in Energy, thermal, renewables, all in?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, the total was down 1%. I don't have the split between the pieces. The total for Energy selling price was 1% down. For the company, it was 0.5% down in total.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Looking through the initial resumption of GE Capital dividend but noting the ENI targets coming down, is it reasonable to expect that future GE Capital payout ratio could be well above the historical payout ratios?","Keith S. Sherin","Well, our goal that we've laid out is that we'd like to have GE Capital pay the same percent of its earnings that GE pays to its shareholders. So we're at about a 45% payout ratio and that would be our goal. Now sometimes in the Financial Services world, the discussion is that there's a 33% or 30% payout ratio at the banks, but there's also buybacks on top of that. GE Capital doesn't have that equivalent of a buyback. So I think that's a reasonable expectation. That's what we're working on is to start with a 45% of GE Capital's earnings back to the parent, which would be above historical. The second thing that I think that we're thinking about is as we shrink GE Capital, as we've built up the capital base, we have excess capital, we believe, on top of whatever the target of capital that regulators are going to require for Tier 1 for a very large important financial institution. We haven't formally been notified that we're a SIFI. We aren't under anybody's Basel framework yet, but we're reporting like we will be and we believe we have capital levels that will exceed what the targets are that we\u2019ll be -- the banks will be held to. And our objective is as we shrink GE Capital the dividend, that excess capital back to the parent. And over the next several years, that could be several billions of dollars. So our -- that's our goal. We'll have to see how we do as we work with the Fed, but that's our goal.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And next question, answer might be obvious, but I'll ask it anyway. Are you buying any properties in CRE?","Keith S. Sherin","We're not buying any properties. We have done some debt investing, but we're not buying any properties. We're running the equity book down.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, with the double-digits earnings framework for both capital and industrial, are you biased to one exceeding the other or too close to call?","Keith S. Sherin","No bias. We want to execute well and have a good year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Feldman from UBS.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So on the Energy service front, earlier this year, the federal court stated that the CSAPR rules, which we had expected to shift more fuel switching from coal to gas. Does that impact your outlook on the service side at all for this year?","Keith S. Sherin","I couldn't tell you. I am not familiar with that, and I'd have to get -- we'll have to get back to you on that, Jason. I do think the gas power is running harder. There's no doubt about it, but I don't know that, that specific change is material in the way we think about financials for the year.","Jason Feldman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And balance of plant revenues come up when we're talking about the Energy margins, I think, the last 2 quarters. Last quarter, it was a bit of a headwind or maybe more than a bit of a headwind. This quarter, it sounds like a year-over-year comp basis, it actually helped you. Can you give us a little bit more quantification of how much of a difference that made? And is that just kind of volatility that we just have to live with, given the nature of the business?","Keith S. Sherin","The only thing I have is that we're about $100 million lower on balance of plant in the quarter. So obviously, there is no margin really associated with that. It did help the margin rates a little bit, but it also contributes to lower revenue. So that's the only number I had.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg of Langenberg & Company.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","Two questions. The first one is with respect to the merger of GE Capital, GECC, you're not a company that tends to let things lay for like 20 years. So until recently, there was a reason to have that structure. Just touch on what operational and\/or tax benefits are -- have gone away with going from 2 to 1, 2 structures to 1? And then the second part is how much cost out do you think you can get to offset the $300 million of additional spending you need to do in the new financial world? That's the first question.","Jeffrey R. Immelt","Well, let me start with the first one. There was a good logic for GE Capital Services. We had a broker-dealer, Kidder, Peabody. And we had significant insurance operations, both what is now Genworth that we call GEFA and also ERC. So the insurance operations, the reinsurance operations and the Kidder, Peabody were originally under GECS on the other side of the ownership, and then GECC was on the other side of -- as part of the assets of GE Capital Services. But the point is that, over time, as we sold all the insurance businesses, as we got out of the Kidder and the broker-dealer, really, the difference between GECS and GECC is almost insignificant. We have about $30 billion of investment securities and we'll have the GE Capital team, Mike Neal and Jeff Bornstein and Bill Cary and those guys manage that. Now there's an insignificant change in our tax outlook as a result of this merger. So really, it's just a collapse of 2 SEC registrants and over time, it had a purpose and today, it has less of a purpose and actually just provides kind of confusion. In terms of costs, it\u2019s -- the GE Capital team's done a great job on SG&A. Our SG&A was actually down in 2011 despite the fact that we're investing like crazy on the regulatory side. So they're getting good productivity in their back office and they continue to do a good job managing their costs.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","And so in terms of collapsing 2 into 1, is there a significant incremental cost to come out once the 2 structures go away?","Keith S. Sherin","No, I think it's really in some of the accounting, consolidation and reporting, it'll simplify their life, but there's not a big cost structure at GECS.","Brian K. Langenberg - Langenberg & Company, LLC","Okay. And then just a last question. With aerospace, you called out some pre-buy in the third quarter, which is not something I\u2019d really heard about from other aerospace players. I mean, just kind of looking at it simplistically, are you suggesting that there's a good $250 million of pre-buy in the third quarter on the aerospace side?","Keith S. Sherin","It would have been orders for spare parts. I don't you think that would have showed up in their cash flow yet, their ordering. So we can -- we report our average daily order rate. I can't tell you what the timing of when they actually took that was, but it was $29 million a day or something, $27 million a day in the third quarter, up 20%. We didn't expect it to be that high and basically, they're just getting in, in advance of our November price increase. So in terms of when they actually took that material, that's not something I have. And [indiscernible] in the third quarter, we're nowhere near as high as that. So it really would have been ordering.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Bank of America.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Keith, so just to clarify, so do any of the quarters in '12 have this days issue as it pertains to the compares versus '11? I'm just going back to Terry's question.","Keith S. Sherin","I asked the same question yesterday and I\u2019ve been assured that we're on a normal calendar comparison in 2012. Happy to report, John.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, okay. Right. No, that clears up that. Going back to the restructuring, again I don\u2019t want to split hairs. I thought the fourth quarter was maybe going to be $0.03 to $0.04, you said $0.02. Does that imply that there is sort of front-loaded restructuring this year? And maybe, Keith, if you could scope out sort of what your thoughts are vis-a-vis restructuring in Europe. I mean, I know you talked about Healthcare restructuring, but is half of this going to be Europe, front-half weighted, just anything you could maybe call out?","Keith S. Sherin","Sure. I would say, first of all, what we talked about in December, we have a category restructuring and other charges that was going to be about $0.03, and that's $0.03 to $0.04 and we did $0.03. It's not that we really pushed anything out. We work with the teams on what projects can they identify that have a good payback and can they execute? And we ended up with the projects we identified. I would say over half of the projects that we funded in the fourth quarter are related to Europe in Healthcare and Energy. And if you look at, going forward, in 2012 and our plan, we've -- on a normal quarter, we're somewhere around $100 million of restructuring in our quarter and our plan is kind of built assuming that type of run rate. Now if we have more good projects, we may pull some in. We'll reserve the right. But just based from a planning and how we talked about that $3 billion of costs in the corporate line, that's how you should think about it, John.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So kind of linearly spread throughout the year then?","Keith S. Sherin","So far, yes.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just lastly, Keith, the provisions for the capital were relatively flat sequentially. What's been happening to provisions in Europe and maybe you could give us just -- I didn't see it in the supplemental. What was the ending asset, financial asset base in Europe? I think it was $132 million or something in the third quarter?","Keith S. Sherin","I think Europe was down a little bit. I don't have the exact number. We'll get it to you and I don't separate provisions by region. I have it by business. Provisions were -- if you look, reserves came down about $300 million. Some of that was write-offs greater than provisions, some of that was FX and provisions were flat in Europe.","John G. Inch - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. So the question is, really, you're not really seeing incremental losses associated with European...","Keith S. Sherin","Well, actually, the asset quality was actually better. The only thing in Europe that we -- was unusual, I would say, was the 2 things. One is the Greek bonds and the second thing, we put up some money in Hungary for mortgages.","Operator","We have no more questions. I will turn it back over to you, Trevor.","Trevor A.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon, and I\u2019ll be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Brandon. Good morning and welcome to GE\u2019s fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Jamie Miller.","Before we start, I\u2019d like to remind you that the press release and presentation are available on our website. Note that some of the statements we\u2019re making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","Please note that we will hold an investor call on Wednesday, March 4th to provide more detail on our 2020 outlook.","With that, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Steve, thanks. Good morning, everyone and thank you for Joining us.","I\u2019ll begin with an overview on our performance and progress on our execution against our strategic priorities. Jamie will cover the financials in more detail, and then will turn to our expectations for 2020.","Starting on slide two, you\u2019ll find a snapshot of our fourth quarter and full year results. Overall, fourth quarter marked a strong close to the year as we met or exceeded our financial targets in 2019.","Orders were down 3% organically in the quarter as positive growth in Aviation and Healthcare was more than offset by declines in Power and Renewables. Notably, Aviation\u2019s double-digit orders growth was driven by our newly formed Aeroderivatives JV between GE Power and Baker Hughes, following deconsolidation. Excluding that JV, Aviation\u2019s orders were up 1%. For the year, total Company orders closed up 1% organically.","We ended 2019 with backlog of $405 billion, up 15% year-on-year. This comprises equipment of $79 billion, up 2%; and services of $326 billion, up 19%, representing approximately 80% of our backlog.","We delivered Industrial segment organic revenue growth of 4.6% in the quarter, and 5.5% for the full year, with all segments posting positive growth. Our service businesses, which represent about half of our industrial revenue in the quarter and the year, continue to be a differentiator with our customers, and a key driver of profitability.","Our adjusted Industrial profit margin expanded 410 basis points and 390 basis points organically in the quarter, driven by Aviation and Power. For the year, margins expanded 60 basis points and 10 basis points organically, driven by Power and Healthcare with Aviation margins closing above 20%.","We generated Industrial free cash flow of $3.9 billion in the quarter and $2.3 billion for the full year. This came in ahead of our most recent outlook as Power outperformed expectations and we saw continued strength in Aviation.","As I reflect on the year, we\u2019ve come a long way since my initial visit as CEO with each of the businesses in late 2018. Aviation and Healthcare are clearly exceptional franchises, delivering profitable growth for the year with runway to go.","In Aviation, the business was able to grow free cash flow versus prior year, despite the $1.4 billion of cash headwind from the Boeing 737 MAX grounding. At Healthcare, we operate at the center of precision health. As Kieran and team outlined for many of you in December, growth has and will continue to be driven by innovative solutions in our digital capabilities, resulting in products such as the Revolution Maxima CT scanner, which we launched at RSNA.","At Power, we\u2019re proud of our progress in stabilizing Gas Power but we have more to do. In Power portfolio, while there were puts and takes, we gained better line of sight into these businesses. For example, Power Conversion showed signs of operational improvement this year, such as better on-time delivery at their facility in Brazil.","In Renewables, our full year results were more mixed. Reflecting on each of the businesses here. In onshore wind and LM, earnings and cash trends improved through 2019, as we delivered on a steep ramp to meet customer demand. In offshore wind, we\u2019re still in investment mode, as we build our global presence and prepare to launch the Haliade-X, next year, the world\u2019s largest wind turbine.","The focus in both, grid solutions and hydro is simply on the turnaround. We\u2019re working through complex projects, improving our underwriting framework and focusing on daily execution in both our factories and in our field service organization, as well as taking cost reduction measures.","Last week, I was in Paris for operating reviews with each of these businesses, and this reinforced my conviction that we can and will improve our performance in Renewables.","In the GE Capital, we delivered positive earnings, driven by better operations, tax and gains as we continue to simplify the GE Capital portfolio.","So, while 2019 was year one in our multiyear transformation, I\u2019m encouraged by the evidence of momentum I see across GE. Stepping back from the quarter, we made substantial progress on our priorities in 2019, as outlined on slide three.","First on improving our financial position, we move with speed on a number of deleveraging actions, which set us up to achieve our deleveraging targets in 2020. At Industrial, we reduced net debt by $7 billion, ending the year at a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2, down from 4.8 a year ago. We used the proceeds from our Wabtec and Baker Hughes sales to pay down debt, including a $5 billion debt tender. In 2020, we expect to close BioPharma for about $20 billion of net proceeds and achieve our leverage target of less than 2.5 times.","At Capital, we reduced debt by $7 billion, ending 2019 with a debt to equity ratio of 3.9, down from 5.7 in 2018. We expect to close 2020 below our leverage target of less than 4 times. We also completed approximately $12 billion of asset reductions this year, bringing our two-year total to $27 billion, which surpasses our $25 billion target. Our deleveraging progress will allow us to focus more of our time and energy executing on our other priority, which is strengthening our businesses.","It\u2019s no secret that power has been our focus over the last year, and across the board, we are improving execution. In Gas Power, we\u2019re building backlog with lower risk as evidenced by zero turnkey projects booked in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re underwriting the business financials with more conservative commercial assumptions with our 2020 equipment plan now 100% in backlog. And we\u2019re rightsizing the business for today\u2019s market through a reduction in fixed costs by 15% in the quarter and 10% in the year versus 2018. Let\u2019s be clear, we\u2019re still on a multiyear journey at Gas Power to deliver a more reliable contribution to GE Industrial\u2019s overall performance.","As I\u2019ve shared with you before, even our best businesses can be stronger, including Healthcare where we see opportunity to drive faster Healthcare Systems growth, post the BioPharma sale. This year, Healthcare Systems grew revenue 1% organically, and we expect low to mid-single-digit growth going forward. We\u2019ll do this through targeted increases in R&D, and prioritizing programs with the highest returns as well as better execution on our safety, quality, delivery and cost reduction efforts.","For example, during my recent visit to Buc, France, where we produce our Senographe Pristina mammography machines, I met with our teams using lean principles, such as value stream mapping and daily management to improve both our supply chain and our commercial performance.","Investing in restructuring has also been an important effort in 2019, especially across Power Renewables and Corporate as we reorient our cost structure for the future and move the center of gravity to our operating businesses. While cash and expense were lower than our original outlook this year due to a mix of timing, attrition and better execution, our expected cost savings remain on track.","At Corporate, for example, our core functional costs were down 8% in the year. This was a result of our actions to shrink costs as people, processes and accountability are moved to the segments. The team made solid progress on headcount reduction with roughly 2,500 people this year, resulting in real corporate cost savings. While we\u2019re not finished with restructuring, better margins and returns will also be the result of improved underwriting discipline, stronger execution in both the factory and the field, shifting our business mix more toward services and launching accretive new products.","This year, much of our substantial progress was in areas less visible to those of you on the outside of GE. This starts with how we run the Company on a daily basis. We\u2019re in the early days of a lean transformation, developing leaders capable of identifying and solving problems alike, establishing standard work and embracing our values of candor, transparency, and humility. Our strategic conversations are being woven throughout the year and an ongoing sequence of operations, talent and budget reviews. This type of rigor and prioritization is changing how we work.","As I travel to our businesses, I see real momentum building, which is only partially evident in the numbers we\u2019re sharing with you today. For example, earlier this month, David Joyce and I were in Ohio at our Aviation Component Service Center, which repairs complex parts used to service our customers\u2019 engines, witnessing lean principles firsthand. The results were impressive, a 14-day improvement in our turnaround time that will positively impact customers and our bottom-line. Moreover, we were so impressed by the operators there, motivated, passionate, experts and using lean tools to improve their daily work. I\u2019m excited to go back.","So, in summary, I\u2019m heartened by our progress in 2019. And I do believe we enter the New Year with momentum. There\u2019s still plenty of work to do, but we\u2019re changing the way we work together with a firm eye on delivering better results and ultimately a stronger culture.","I just want to take a moment to thank all of those on the GE team listening for their grit, their resilience, and clear sense of ownership, as we\u2019ve driven the change we have over the last year. I\u2019m looking forward to more.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, Larry.","Starting with the fourth quarter summary. Orders were $24.9 billion, down 3% organically, with growth in aviation largely from Aero orders, as well as Healthcare offset by declines in Power and Renewables. Equipment orders were down 10% organically while services were up 6% organically. Consolidated revenue was $26.2 billion, down 1% in the quarter. Industrial segment revenue was up 4.6% organically with equipment revenue up 7% and services revenue up 2% and organic growth in all segments.","The biggest drivers of growth were Aviation equipment and services, Renewables equipment, driven by onshore wind and Power services. For the year, Industrial segment revenue was up 5.5% organically.","Adjusted Industrial profit margins were 11.3% in the quarter, up 410 basis points reported. The majority of margin accretion was driven by better operational rigor and the non-repeat of about $800 million of charges we took in Gas Power last year, and higher volume in Aviation services. All segments other than Renewables expanded margins in the quarter. For the year, we saw significant margin expansion in Power and Healthcare, the declines in Renewables and Aviation.","Fourth quarter net EPS was $0.06, continuing EPS was $0.07, and adjusted EPS was $0.21. Walking from continuing EPS, we had $0.08 from gains and our remaining stake in Baker Hughes, which we measure at fair value each quarter. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.03 of charges related to restructuring and M&A cost across our segments, principally in Power.","Next, we incurred a $0.07 charge for deal taxes related to the BioPharma transaction, based on preparatory internal restructuring ahead of the expected close in the first quarter. Non-operating pension and other benefit plans were $0.10 in the quarter, which includes about $600 million of additional expense this quarter associated with the pension freeze we announced in October. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was $0.21 in the fourth quarter.","Moving to cash. We generated Industrial free cash flow of $3.9 billion for the quarter, $800 million lower than prior year. Income, depreciation and amortization totaled $1.5 billion, down $200 million net of goodwill impairment versus prior year.","Working capital was positive $1.6 billion. Similar to last quarter, accounts receivable was a usage of cash, driven by the impact of the MAX grounding and reductions in long-term receivables and other factoring program levels. The MAX grounding was a negative $400 million working capital cash flow impact in the quarter.","All other working capital accounts were a source of cash, driven by lower inventory from higher seasonal volume and cash collections on new orders and project milestones. The supply chain finance transition was a usage of cash in the quarter as anticipated, but less than originally planned.","For the year, we completed negotiations with over 80% of the large suppliers and anticipate completing the transition in 2020 with results better than our original outlook. Contract assets were a source of cash of $400 million, in part driven by billings from a CSA contract termination and cash received on converting a customer to a CSA contract at Aviation. Another CFOA was $1.1 billion, which includes restructuring cash usage, accrued discount and allowance payments in Aviation, and non-cash items offset in net income.","We also spent about $700 million in gross CapEx, driven by aviation. For the year, industrial free cash flow was $2.3 billion, down $2 billion versus prior year. The most significant driver of the decrease was in working capital due to the MAX grounding and the reduction in certain receivable monetization programs. While there were many puts and takes, the $2.3 billion was ahead of our expectations due to strong performance in Power, which carried forward from the first half, largely driven by collections at Gas and Steam Power, and partially the timing of project disbursements.","Lower restructuring of about $800 million, driven by the items Larry mentioned earlier, lower impact from the supply chain finance transition, and Aviation performance were strong cash collections and services, including a fourth quarter parts distribution deal for a legacy engine program and timing on discount and allowance payments helped more than offset the $1.4 billion headwind from the MAX grounding.","Moving to liquidity on slide six. We ended the fourth quarter with $17.6 billion of Industrial cash, up approximately $1 billion sequentially, largely driven by positive free cash flow of $3.9 billion. This was offset partially by the $2.5 billion equity contribution at GE Capital, as planned, and the $1 billion intercompany loan repayment where we have about $12 billion left to go in 2020. In line with our ongoing goal to reduce our reliance on short-term funding, average short-term funding was $4.3 billion this quarter, down from $10.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. And peak intra-quarter short-term funding was $4.7 billion, down from $14.8 billion last year.","Overall, our liquidity position remains strong, with over $17 billion in Industrial cash. And we continue to have access to $35 billion in bank lines, and this will step down in 2020 as we complete the Biopharma transaction, and take other deleveraging actions.","Next on leverage on slide seven. We are improving our financial position and reducing our leverage. As Larry shared, we reduced net debt by $7 billion, ending the year with leverage of 4.2 times, down from 4.8 times at year-end 2018. This was achieved through the $5 billion debt tender, and the $1.5 billion intercompany loan repayment from GE to GE Capital, and a higher cash balance at year-end. We expect to achieve our Industrial leverage goal of less than 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA in 2020.","We also announced comprehensive U.S. pension actions, which will reduce our net debt by $5 billion to $6 billion when completed. As you may recall, as of the third quarter, we were estimating a potential increase to our global pension deficit of approximately $5 billion. Ultimately, this deficit increased by only $900 million versus the prior year. Year-over-year, the key drivers were pressure from the lower discount rate, largely offset by higher year-end asset returns and the completion of the pension freeze and lump sum offerings.","We have substantial sources to delever and derisk our balance sheet. To-date, we have received $9 billion of proceeds from our Wabtec and Baker Hughes sales. We are on track to close BioPharma in the first quarter, and we\u2019ll continue to sell down our remaining stake in Baker Hughes in an orderly fashion.","Post the BioPharma close, we will execute on the previously announced 2020 deleveraging actions that you see on the right. We\u2019ll contribute $4 billion to $5 billion to our U.S. pension, which we expect will meet the estimated minimum ERISA funding requirements through at least 2022. We will also repay the remaining intercompany loan of $12 billion from GE to GE Capital, which will be used to pay down 2020 GE Capital debt maturities. Finally, we will repay approximately $1 billion of maturing Industrial debt.","As we\u2019ve previously said, while our Industrial leverage target will be less than 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA, we also evaluate other measures, including gross debt to EBITDA, and we will ultimately size our deleveraging actions across a range of measures to ensure we are operating the Company with the strong balance sheet. ","We will evaluate additional potential actions based on their deleveraging impact, economics, risk mitigation and our target capital structure while also monitoring key risks. Over 2019 and 2020, we expect that our total cash deleveraging actions will be in the range of $30 billion.","Next on Power. For the quarter, orders of $4.5 billion were down 28% organically. Power portfolio orders were down 55% organically, largely driven by the non-repeat of a large steam equipment order in fourth quarter 2018. Gas Power orders were down 8% organically, [Technical Difficulty] down 49% organically, largely driven by the non-repeat of a large turnkey order in fourth quarter of 2018. We booked 3.7 gigawatts of orders for 22 gas turbines, including three HA units and one aeroderivative unit. Gas Power services orders were up 12% organically with transactional and contractual services up on higher volume, as well as commercial and utilization improvement while upgrades were down. This was the strongest quarter of services growth in 2019.","Backlog closed at $85 billion, down 2% sequentially and flat versus prior year. Gas Power, representing $71 billion of segment backlog was up 3%. Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 5% organically with Gas Power revenue up 9% and Power portfolio revenue down 4%. Gas Power shipped 21 gas turbines including 5 H units and 3 aeroderivative units versus 22 turbines in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included 3 H units and 8 aeroderivative units. We helped our customers achieve commercial operation on over 20 units this quarter, which translates to almost 4.5 gigawatts of new power added to the grid. Gas Power services revenue was up, driven by transactional and contractual revenues, which were up on a robust fall outage season and improved commercial performance. Upgrades were down in line with our guidance on continued market dynamics.","Operating profit was $302 million, up $1.1 billion, and reported segment margin was 5.6%, an increase of more than 2,000 basis points. This was largely driven by better operational rigor and stronger processes at Gas Power as we did not incur charges related to projects, product and fleet utilization that we experienced in the fourth quarter of 2018, as well as we had improved volume. We also continue to reduce Gas Power fixed costs, which were down 15% versus the prior year. For the year, organic revenue was down 1%, reflecting a decline in Power portfolio, reported segment margin was 2.1%, and free cash flow was negative $1.5 billion. While we have more to do, the team has laid a stable foundation by base lining the business to new market realities and driving operational improvements.","Next on Renewable Energy, orders of $4.7 billion were down 10% organically due to the non-repeat of large deals at Hydro and Grid Solutions. Equipment orders were down 7% and services orders were down 22% organically. Onshore Wind orders were flat as international strength offset a decline in North America. And notably, new order pricing in Onshore Wind continues to stabilize.","Overall, backlog of $28 billion was flat sequentially, and up 16% year-over-year. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 4% organically, mainly driven by onshore volume. Total equipment revenue was up 3% organically as Onshore Wind marked record deliveries in the quarter of 1,553 total turbans of repower kits, with roughly two-thirds of these in the U.S. while services revenue was down 22% organically.","Operating profit of negative $197 million was down to $176 million, and reported segment margin was negative 4.1%, a contraction of 360 basis points. Positive volume was more than offset by headwinds from project execution, particularly in grid, pricing, tariffs and increased R&D investment. Importantly, onshore was profitable for the third consecutive quarter and full year.","Looking at the full year, organic revenue was up 11%, reported segment margin was negative 4.3% and free cash flow was negative $1 billion. Renewables free cash flow was impacted by lower earnings offset by progress collections which were less of a headwind in 2019 than we expected. We anticipate that progress collections will be a headwind in 2020 as we execute on heavy PTC delivery volume that exceeds inbound collections. As Larry noted, Renewables is a key operational focus for the team.","At Aviation, orders of $10.7 billion were up 23% organically with equipment orders up 40% organically. This was primarily driven by the Aeroderivatives JV. Total orders excluding Aeroderivatives were up 1% organically, as commercial engine orders were down 33% due to LEAP orders down 63%, while services orders were up 12%.","Backlog grew to $273 billion, up 8% sequentially and up 22% versus prior year, primarily driven by long-term service agreements. Revenue of $8.9 billion was up 7% organically, equipment revenue was up 13% organically, driven by sales of 420 LEAP-1A and LEAP-1B units, up 41 from last year, partially offset by CFM units down 74%. We shipped 675 units this quarter, down 11% from prior year.","Services revenues were up 3% organically due to commercial services also up 3%, reflecting higher external shop visits and a more favorable mix of shop visits. Total military sales were up 13% organically with 227 engine unit shipments up 32% with growth in development programs. Operating profit of $2.1 billion was up 19%. Organically on improved volumes, price and net productivity offset by negative mix. Reported segment margin of 23% expanded 260 basis points versus the prior year, driven by commercial aftermarket strength. As in prior quarters, this was partially offset by the CFM to LEAP transition, which was a 60 basis-point drag, and the passport engine shipments which were a 70 basis-point drag in the quarter. For the year, organic revenue was up 9%, segment margin was 20.6% and free cash flow was $4.4 billion.","Looking at Healthcare, we finished in line with what we shared with you at our Investor Day in December. Orders of $5.9 billion were up 3% organically, equipment orders were up 4%, and services were up 2% organically. On a product line basis, Healthcare Systems orders were up 1% organically driven by growth in Life Care Solutions, services and ultrasound, partially offset by imaging, largely due to market dynamics in China. In the U.S. and Canada, Healthcare Systems was up 1% organically, boosted by solid growth in imaging and ultrasound. Life Sciences orders were up 10% organically.","Backlog was $18.5 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 6% versus prior year. Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 1% organically. Healthcare Systems revenue was flat organically with equipment down, offset by services growth. Operating profit of $1.2 billion was flat organically and reported segment margin was 21.9%, up 10 basis points. This was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by tariffs, price and program investments. For the year, organic revenue was up 3% with Healthcare Systems up 1%. Segment margin was 19.5% and free cash flow was $2.5 billion.","On GE Capital, continuing operations generated net income of $69 million, up $27 million versus the prior year, excluding the prior year tax reform impact of $128 million. The favorability was driven by lower marks and impairments, and interest expense, partially offset by lower gains, tax benefits and operations. For the year, continuing operations generated adjusted net income of $139 million, up $455 million versus the prior year, excluding the impact of tax reform and the insurance annual premium deficiency tests.","Capital ended the quarter with $102 billion of assets excluding liquidity, down $7 billion sequentially, primarily driven by lower GECAS, WCS and EFS assets. GECAS completed the sale of substantially all of the PK AirFinance business and we expect the remaining assets of that to be sold in the first half of 2020.","Capital completed asset reductions of approximately $8 billion in the quarter for a total of $12 billion in 2019. Including the $15 billion in 2018, we exceeded the $25 billion asset reduction target previously communicated.","In addition, WMC concluded its Chapter 11 case in the quarter. And as of year-end, GE Capital has no further liabilities to WMC. Capital finished the quarter with $19 billion of liquidity, which was up $8 billion sequentially, primarily driven by disposition proceeds of $7 billion and the capital infusion of $2.5 billion, partially offset by debt maturities of $2 billion. We remain focused on derisking GE Capital, including approving its leverage profile.","Capital\u2019s debt at year-end was $59 billion, down by $1 billion sequentially, primarily driven by debt maturities, partially offset by the intercompany loan repayment of $1.5 billion. We ended 2019 with the Capital debt-to-equity ratio at 3.9 times. With the anticipated repayment of the intercompany loan, this ratio will increase throughout 2020, but we expect to end 2020 at less than 4 times.","Discontinued operations generated a net loss of $63 million up $29 million versus the prior year, driven by WMC, DOJ and other litigation reserves in 2018.","As we look to 2020, insurance will complete its annual statutory cash flow test in the first quarter and we also expect lower earnings from GE Capital, primarily driven by lower asset sale gain, a smaller earning asset base and other non-recurring items, but we still expect capital to break even by 2021.","Moving to corporate. Adjusted operating costs were $600 million in the quarter, up versus prior year due to higher intercompany profit eliminations and increased remedial costs relating to existing environmental health and safety matters. For the year, adjusted operating costs were $1.7 billion, up $400 million versus the prior year, largely led by the same drivers, as well as the non-repeat of intangible asset sales. This was in line with our revised corporate outlook from the previous quarter. Importantly, our core functional costs were down 8% in the year as we move the center of gravity from corporate to the businesses.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Jamie, thanks.","Before I move to our outlook, I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge our CFO transition announcement since our last earnings call and recognize Jamie\u2019s significant contributions to GE during her tenure. She has been a trusted partner through an unprecedented period of change, including my own transition into the CEO role and your complete refresh of the GE Board, portfolio moves to make GE a more focused industrial Company and foundational shifts in our culture to drive greater rigor and transparency. She has been instrumental in setting and spearheading our deleveraging plan, and she will leave GE in a place where we are set to achieve those deleveraging targets in 2020. I appreciate not only her many contributions across the organization, but also her personal support and partnership. On behalf of all of us, thank you, Jamie.","From where I sit today, I\u2019m excited and confident in our efforts to build a stronger and more focused GE. We are planning to provide you a detailed 2020 outlook by segment on our March 4th investor call. But today, I\u2019ll share our expectations for the total Company.","So, moving to slide 10, you\u2019ll find our targets on the right hand side. We\u2019re expecting organic growth in the low-single-digit range for Industrial; organic expansion of up to 75 basis points for Industrial operating margins; $0.50 to $0.60 for adjusted EPS; and a range of $2 billion to $4 billion for our Industrial free cash flow.","There are a number of key assumptions underpinning our plan again this year. First is the lost cash and earnings from dispositions, most notably BioPharma and Baker Hughes. Our outlook assumes that the BioPharma sale closes in the first quarter, and a reduction of Baker Hughes dividends, in line with the orderly sale of our remaining stake. For reference, in 2019, for the full year, BioPharma generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in profit, while Baker Hughes dividends represented approximately $350 million of cash flow. Second is that our plan is dependent on the 737 MAX\u2019s return to service, which we are planning for mid-2020, in line with Boeing\u2019s commentary. That said, the situation remains fluid.","Looking across the segments. Renewables is the key operational focus for us in 2020 as we continue to deliver the onshore wind ramp, invest in offshore and turn around both grid and hydro. This journey to improve earnings and cash at Renewables will take time.","We are expecting continued improvement in Power, continued strength in Healthcare and Aviation and lower Capital earnings compared to 2019. And in each business, we are enhancing operational rigor and cost management, which includes continued restructuring while non-operational headwinds continue to diminish.","In summary, our results will be a byproduct of delivering on our commitments day-in and day-out in the environment in which we operate. Despite areas of volatility in aggregate, we have a positive trajectory in 2020.","Moving to slide 11 where we\u2019ve outlined our priorities for the year. First, solidifying our financial position, building on the actions we took in 2019 to achieve our leverage targets. Second, continuing to strengthen our businesses over the near to medium-term. Critical to this will be operating differently as our lean transformation gains traction. And third, driving long-term profitable growth, which I\u2019m confident that GE team can deliver through innovative and efficient technologies and our global network. Combined, these strengths help us build upon our valuable installed base that keeps us close to our customers, helping solve their most important problems.","And with that, let\u2019s take your questions. Steve?","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Larry. Before we open the line, I\u2019d ask everyone in the queue again to consider your fellow analysts and ask one question and a follow-up, so we can get to as many people as possible. Brandon, please open the line. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And from Bank of America, we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","I just want to start out by expressing my thanks to Jamie and best wishes going forward.","Jamie Miller","Thank you.","Andrew Obin","So, a couple of questions; I\u2019ll just ask both of them together. So, the first one is Airbus has publicly indicated that they\u2019re making sizable adjustments in payables in 2020. And, we understand engines is one of the biggest components. So, how much, if any of this is baked into your 2020 forecast? And the follow-up question is dynamic in Power Services improving. Nice to see, but what are you doing differently exactly? So, these are my two questions. Thanks.","Larry Culp","Andrew, as you know well, we have an excellent relationship with Airbus. I was with them just last week, in fact. The guide today relative to Aviation is one we want by design to keep at a higher level. As you can imagine, the primary puts and takes here are really going to be in and around the timing, the assumptions with respect to MAX. But I think, on balance, we have work to do with our friends at Airbus. We\u2019re committed to and will provide more of an update in March.","Jamie Miller","Yes. And Andrew, as it relates to Airbus, I can\u2019t comment on their aviation payables. What I can tell you, we talked on the third quarter call about the impact of some of our timing of payment of discounts and allowances back to the airframers. And it is across the board, across multiple of our programs, there are puts and takes. But, we do see on that front, some -- we saw tailwinds in 2019. We do see some headwinds in 2020. And that\u2019s baked into how we\u2019re thinking about 2020.","Larry Culp","Andrew, your second question, if I heard it correctly, was about Power Services?","Andrew Obin","Correct.","Larry Culp","I would say we\u2019re doing a number of things. Clearly, within Gas Power, what we see is just better commercial execution in and around the way we are coordinating with our customers there, both their outage schedule and our other CSA applications. I would tell you on the transactional side, what you see the team doing -- or what I saw the team do through the course of the year is just better, more regular call patterns, contacts, point - forward planning with our customers, so that we are in front of the opportunities to sell into their installed base to the extent possible. That commercial work is really coupled with what we\u2019re doing operationally to improve lead times, to improve on-time delivery, so that we not only are well-positioned to deliver on time and within budget scheduled outages, but that we have a better quick response capability.","So, I think, as we look at the fourth quarter numbers, it\u2019s good to see the uptick that we did. I think, if you look at the year on balance, clearly suggests there\u2019s more work to do. And I think, team is fully committed to doing that and continuing the exit momentum here through 2020.","Andrew Obin","Thank you very much.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. I do want to echo Andrew\u2019s comments. Thanks, Jamie. Good luck. You\u2019ll be missed by us. I\u2019m not sure you\u2019ll miss us. But, good luck.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","I\u2019m sure, you won\u2019t miss these calls. That\u2019s for sure. I do want to touch on Aviation. Just first of all, obviously the EBIT performance this quarter was very impressive. I think, it\u2019s a record quarterly performance. Anything unusual to factor in there or to think about? But, more importantly how do we think about the boundaries around the MAX grounding? If production is grounded through the year end, how do we think about the earnings and free cash impact to GE?","Larry Culp","Nigel, let me -- let us take those in reverse order. You\u2019re exactly right in terms of the strong performance. And I would argue the strong performance for the full year that we saw in Aviation, despite the MAX headwinds. But, as we look forward, I think we\u2019re looking at a more complex situation in and around the MAX. Clearly, priority one here is safety. I think, our friends at Boeing have been crystal clear. We\u2019re going to take the FAA\u2019s lead here, and we\u2019re trying to support both Boeing and the FAA to the fullest extent possible.","I think, if you look back, before we look forward, clearly, we were building engines; we were delivering to Boeing at normal rates through 2019. We\u2019re going to see our shipment rates fall roughly half the \u201819 rate in \u201820. Clearly, it\u2019s going to be a bit of a gap here as a result relative to deliveries. And in turn, that drives some of the variability that you see in the guide. I think, from an operating perspective, what we\u2019re really dealing with are three things, right? We are going to have a lower build profile, which in turn will challenge us on the cost side. We need to make sure that we are adjusting our cost structure accordingly but also taking the long view, because this will be a temporary wall, as Boeing has indicated, and we will be ramping up presumably later in the year. So, we want to make sure that not only our teams, but our supply chains are prepared to rebound.","With the mid-year return to service, we know we\u2019re going to see fewer spare engine deliveries. Folks were ramping through the back half of last year in preparation for return to service. There\u2019ll be a bit of a wall there as well that will put a little bit of mix pressure on us obviously. And I think, we\u2019ll continue to see fewer new orders, which are a nice source of cash for us, at least until mid-year. But, if that mid-year return to services realized, clearly we\u2019re going to resume deliveries. And that\u2019ll be a positive from a cash perspective in terms of just the AR that will come in, clearly a bit of an offset relative to process -- progress liquidation.","So, a number of moving pieces here. We\u2019re going to manage through this as we always do. But, it\u2019s not simply the setup that we saw last year where we were building, shipping, delivering and seeing the receivables build, many more moving pieces as we look ahead to 2020.","Jamie Miller","And Nigel, with respect to your second question on Aviation EBITDA quarter-over-quarter. We saw strength in our aftermarket businesses at Aviation, so stronger profitability there year-over-year. We also benefited from the install spares mix we had in the quarter. We had some variable cost productivity, and all of that was somewhat offset by higher R&D and a little bit higher SG&A.","Operator","From RBC Capital Markets, we have Deane Dray.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And, my congratulations and goodbye to Jamie as well.","Jamie Miller","Good morning. Thank you, Deane.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Larry, I know we\u2019re probably going to cover this on the March 4 call, but just some bigger picture thoughts on the approach to guidance this year. You had said earlier that you\u2019re really not targeting EPS specifically. It\u2019s more of an outcome and free cash flow was the target. Just remind us how we might be seeing that in action this year. And do you have a contingency number, either implicitly or explicitly as part of this range?","Larry Culp","Deane, as you indicated at the beginning of that question, we\u2019ll get into a lot more detail on the 4th of March. I think, all we really wanted to do today quite frankly is give everybody our best look at the fourth quarter and the quarter in the context of 2019. We thought that given where we are in preparation for 2020, we could also share earlier this year than we did last year. The broad contours of our outlook for the New Year, you have that. I think that, again, MAX is probably the source of the greatest volatility with the -- or range within that guidance.","Clearly, operationally, I alluded earlier to Renewables being a priority, not that we\u2019re done at Power, but I think we\u2019ve got momentum there with clear work to do at Renewables. But, Deane, your point, I think is spot on. We\u2019re encouraged to look forward here and to see a low-single-digit top-line with everything going on. We think we have the prospect for good margin expansion. That leads to the EPS range, but make no mistake. This team -- the businesses are far more focused on sustainable cash flow generation. And that\u2019s I think what you see in the $2 billion to $4 billion range for next year, I think you see evidence of that in the way that we that we finished. But, what you don\u2019t see in terms of the numbers, what we see in all of our interactions with the businesses, I think it\u2019s just a heightened level of discipline upfront when we\u2019re talking about new business, not only in terms of price but frankly, terms, conditions, scope, everything that can go into making a new order, be it for equipment or service, positive and accretive or not. I think, the daily management that we talk about, applies in our factories when we\u2019re building new equipment, in the field when we are installing that same equipment in the context of projects, let alone what we do in terms of driving service quality and productivity.","So, when you put all that together in a long cycle business, there are going to be different ups and downs in the course of any one quarter. But again, this team is focused on a much more sustainable, higher level of free cash performance over the long-term.","Deane Dray","And just as a follow-up, could you expand on the point on Renewables where you\u2019re still in investment mode in wind specifically?","Larry Culp","Sure. The way I think about Renewables, one segment, but we\u2019ve got, if you will, three different operating priorities in front of us. Our onshore business, clearly is our most mature business in many respects, it\u2019s what drives the segment. We are investing there. But, you look at the growth in onshore wind, last year a very healthy double-digit level, pleased with that. We need to see that convert more directly into margins and cash.","The investment reference I was making was really with respect to offshore wind. You\u2019ve seen some big numbers here in the last 90 days relative to some experts\u2019 outlook for offshore wind. This is an area where we are an innovator. We think with Haliade-X, we have an opportunity to bring an exciting technology to market in 2021 that will help improve our overall performance. But in the near-term, that is a -- that\u2019s an earnings and cash drag for us.","The third bit of Renewables, again, really is the legacy Alstom JVs in Grid and Hydro. We had a full year of the JV performance consolidated in \u201819. That didn\u2019t help our reported numbers. We\u2019re a little bit behind I think where we would like to be in terms of executing on that turn around, which is why we put that front and center here in 2020. I\u2019ll get into that kin more detail if you like. But, those are the three pieces, the investment call out specifically is in and around offshore wind and the Haliade-X program.","Operator","From JP Morgan, we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Congrats on the good cash finish at the end of the year. Can you just give us a little bit of color on progress and what kind of impact that ultimately had for 2019? And then also, the $2.1 billion in corporate expense for free cash flow that includes the Baker dividend. So, it\u2019s even higher than that kind of on a core basis. What goes into that number? And then, one more, just on kind of the high level color you guys gave us last March on 2020 and then the 2021 commentary. Is that considered to be stale now, given you\u2019re going to kind of update that in March or how should we think about those kind of -- that kind of high level guide? ","Jamie Miller","Yes. Steve, I\u2019ll answer your progress question, but maybe you can repeat your second question. I didn\u2019t quite catch that. ","Steve Tusa","Yes. Slide 15, the corporate, negative $2.1 billion.","Jamie Miller","Sorry. Okay. Yes. So, on progress for the year, progress contributed $1.3 billion in working capital inflows. Renewables and Aviation progress and Power was up over the prior year as well. When you look at Corporate, a couple of big drivers there. One is just higher cash tax payments, the other is higher restructuring and corporate. And year-over-year those were the two biggest drivers. When you look out, that starts to temper and come back in line with our expense levels.","Larry Culp","Steve, I think with respect to the guidance, again, in 30 some days, we\u2019re going to be in front of everybody with an update on how we\u2019re thinking about \u201820 and the future. So, I\u2019m not sure how I would characterize that. We can certainly speak to some of the moving pieces in and around the growth and OMX. [Ph] Again, to the earlier question, we\u2019re going to be very focused on free cash, and how we how we step up in 2020.We think we can do that in Aviation, recognizing some of the dynamics at -- in and around the 737 MAX. I would also say, we know we\u2019re going to be challenged in Renewables. And probably we\u2019ll see them not improve their free cash performance, probably we\u2019ll see a step back in 2020. But, we\u2019ll take you through all the details and give you the freshest, latest, consolidated view when we\u2019re together in early March.","Operator","From UBS, we have Markus Mittermaier. Please go ahead.","Markus Mittermaier","Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody. And Jamie, thanks also from my side. On the free cash flow guide, I appreciate that we get more detail on that on the granularity in March. But, just high level, it looks like Power came out significantly better than what we thought maybe nine months ago. How does that progress in the Power portfolio, Power Conversion turnaround? Sort of how you think about that? What\u2019s the timeline? I think, you\u2019ve taken out significant cost down in the Gas Power side. What should we kind of think about as the jumping off point into 2020 here for Power?","Larry Culp","Markus, you\u2019re exactly right. I mean, if we look at where we finished versus where we thought we might be back in March, Power, clearly was the major driver of the outperformance. I think, Jamie referenced in her prepared remarks a better than anticipated supply chain finance transition there. We clearly spent less in restructuring as well. And, again, despite the headwind with the MAX, Aviation was able to do a little bit better. You put all that together, I think it suggests better execution more broadly. Again, I\u2019d like to preserve some of the details as we go from \u201819 to \u201820 and for the March update. But, much of what\u2019s happening in Gas Power is underway within the Power portfolio. We\u2019ve got three businesses there, Power Conversion is but one, and call that roughly $1 billion P&L, where they have really grabbed the organization firmly and are driving costs out improvements, better quality, better delivery performance, smarter underwriting. In Power Conversion specifically, we saw a really nice uptick in just the as-sold margins in that business. I give Russell Stokes, who\u2019s jumped in not only looking after Power portfolio, but Power Conversion specifically as CEO, a lot of credit for the progress that they\u2019re making. I think, we do think Power again will be better as a segment next year from a cash perspective, but still not positive.","Markus Mittermaier","And then, one quick follow-up just for Jamie. You already alluded to the AD&As within aviation. I think, if I remember this right, the tailwind for \u201819 was about $800 million. Would you expect that this reverses completely in 2020 or that\u2019s spread out over maybe more than a year?","Jamie Miller","So, I mentioned on the third quarter call $800 million of favorability roughly that we had expected in 2019. When we print the numbers, it was actually $500 million. So, we did see some catch-up there, more than we expected in the fourth quarter. And we do expect that to reverse fully in 2020 as a headwind.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Josh Pokrzywinski.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just, I guess first question. Larry, you mentioned on -- within the $4 billion -- or $2 billion to $4 billion, the Aviation is kind of the biggest source of volatility or spread within that. I guess, how much of that volatility would you attribute to just timing around the MAX? So, maybe the cumulative number over the next couple of years, doesn\u2019t move around as much but what you\u2019re actually able to capture in 2020 is maybe a bit more volatile?","Larry Culp","Yes. I think that\u2019s well said, Josh. We don\u2019t want to get ahead of the folks at Boeing, who I know are out here shortly. But the first order of business here in 2020 is a safe return to service. Neither Boeing, nor GE is going to dictate that schedule that the FAA will. So, again, given the build profile, the return to service date, the deliveries thereafter, there are a lot of moving pieces here. And I think we just want to embrace that reality, share with you what we know, and acknowledge that even though we\u2019re putting out a range, we could be in a number of different places within it, depending on how this plays out over time. But going forward, I think, we have real conviction in the LEAP engine. Clearly, Boeing is one of two major customers for that engine. And I think going forward that should be a very healthy relationship and a very strong program for us. How that plays out \u201821 and into the future, we\u2019ll see. Again, we\u2019ll refer to our colleagues at Boeing, our customer at Boeing. But at this point, feel like we\u2019re very much on the right track.","Jamie Miller","And, Josh, I would just add to that that when you think about some of the factors Larry mentioned earlier, whether it\u2019s unabsorbed overhead or the mix of installs and spares, particularly spares, but also even the timing of the return of the $1.4 billion impact we felt in 2019. As this is now a mid-year reentry into service, you should expect that we\u2019ll feel more headwinds in the first half and more tailwinds in the second half as production rates really normalize. So, maybe that\u2019s the other factor to think about.","Larry Culp","Yes. But again, Josh, I want to be clear. I think, we just have a lot of respect for what\u2019s happening at Boeing today under Dave\u2019s leadership, right? Clearly, he\u2019ll put safety first, real respect for the primacy of the FAA. Pulling the end on as they did a stop to the line takes a lot of guts. I respect that. I think the focus here couldn\u2019t be clear, right. Recertification, then a return to service, delivering the inventory, then ultimately new production. It is complicated, but I think we see a significant alignment at Boeing and certainly in partnership with us and others in the supply chain. So, it is clearly an unfortunate tragedy that occurred, two tragedies to be specific. But I think going forward, we\u2019ll all hopefully take the lessons here and build a better, stronger industry.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Understood, appreciate that. And then, just quick follow-up on the PTC extension that got announced in December. Does that change the shape of the cash profile over the next year or two at all or still kind of where we would have been otherwise?","Jamie Miller","I think, it\u2019s a little hard to say. Certainly, we still expect the same level of high PTC deliveries in the U.S. in 2020, which will be a progress collection drag for us as that liquidates. But the PTC extension should help in terms of incremental new orders and some mitigating progress collections there on the inbound. So, we\u2019ll have to see a little bit how that market plays out, but we do expect some goodness there.","Operator","From Vertical Research, Jeff Sprague.","Jeff Sprague","Just a couple items. First, back to the MAX. Larry, not to parse words, but you said your shipments to Boeing will be cut roughly in half. I wonder if you\u2019re taking your production down that much. There\u2019s been commentary from Arconic and others that it\u2019s very difficult to mess with these engine production rates. And then secondly on that, returns to service relative to kind of production could be kind of two different items also, given the need to induct what\u2019s in backlog, et cetera. So, if you could just clarify your thinking on both of those, I\u2019d appreciate it. ","Larry Culp","You bet, Jeff. I think, what we\u2019re going to do is, and we\u2019re in the process of doing is bringing our production levels down, mindful of what\u2019s happening at Boeing. But, we\u2019re not bringing that to zero. We very much, if you will, need to keep the lines wet here as we prepare not only for the return to service, but the subsequent ramp. And that\u2019s a function of how we\u2019re going to manage our own teams and in turn suppliers, like Arconic, PCC and the rest. I know there was a comment on somebody\u2019s call relative to this dynamic that we were going to be building more spare engines. That is indeed not the case, just to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. We will probably build ahead a little bit as we go through the year to be prepared for whatever ramp late this year, early next year awaits us. We want to make sure we are there in lockstep with Boeing. But, we do expect our spare engine deliveries with the 1B to come down this year, just as folks see this pause around the return to service schedule.","Jeff Sprague","And just unrelated, but this big JV order with Baker, did that come with the significant deposits in the quarter, and how does that impact the Aviation cash flow, if at all? ","Jamie Miller","Is did not? There was no progress on that in the quarter.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you.","Larry Culp","Thanks, Jeff. ","Operator","From Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. And maybe a question on Capital for a change. So, Jamie, I heard your comments around the leverage level likely rising through this year. You had the $2.5 billion capital infusion in Q4. What are you thinking about further infusions from Industrial to Capital in 2020? And also, any framing you can give the commentary around lower Capital earnings this year? Thank you.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So, in line with what we said before, we do still expect to have GE to GE Capital parent support in 2020, though it will be significantly lower than it was in 2019. Think about it as roughly in line with the insurance statutory funding. We look at a lot of different elements in our economic capital framework based on the risk profile of what we see in our businesses and what\u2019s required to be held at our statutory insurance companies. So, we do still expect something there.","And then, with respect to Capital earnings, the biggest couple of things to think about on 2020 are we\u2019ll -- we just have a smaller asset base. So, we\u2019ll have lower earnings off of a smaller asset base. And then secondly, 2019 benefited from asset sale gains, which as we\u2019ve concluded largely, our asset sale program, those just won\u2019t repeat as we get into 2020. But, as I mentioned before, we still expect Capital to be breakeven, by the time we hit 2021.","Operator","From Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning.","Larry Culp ","Good morning.","Scott Davis","I\u2019ll echo prior comments. Jamie, best of luck to you. I\u2019m sure, we\u2019ll see you hopefully down the road.","Larry Culp","Thank you.","Scott Davis","In any event, one of the questions I wanted to ask Larry is just that is there somewhat of a potential positive impact, longer term on your LEAP production lines and just the slowdown allowing you time to lean things out, maybe upgrade tooling, maybe just take another look at processes and just figure out how to get that -- get down the cost curve faster. Is that something real or not?","Larry Culp","Scott, I would submit that it is very real. The team, I think, made real progress in that regard, coming down the cost curve in 2019. But, a slower pace here will help us not only tend to some delinquencies that we have elsewhere, past dues that we have elsewhere across Aviation, but I think, will also allow us to drive more and better lean principles into all of our production operations, LEAP and elsewhere. But, I think, more broadly, Scott, what we\u2019re most pleased by is again, the clarity of the focus. Safety first, recertification in concert with the FAA, a safe return to service, delivery of the inventories and then we\u2019ll ramp at a slower, lower rate. Just having that clarity goes a long way to help us best serve Boeing and our airline customers. Little bit of pause here helps, but just that clarity goes a long ways we think about the next couple of years and all that we can and should do with LEAP. ","Operator","From Gordon Haskett, we have John Inch. Please go ahead.","John Inch","You guys run all these numbers. So, I\u2019m going to ask, if the MAX has never been grounded, would your $2.3 billion of free cash flow have been $3.7 billion instead? And if the MAX have been producing and flying normally since Jan 1, \u201820, what would your $2 billion to $4 billion of 2020 Industrial guidance? What do you think that would have been in terms of the range?","Jamie Miller","So, 2019, the 1.4 that we\u2019ve talked about before is the V [ph] to our original expectations. So yes, that would have been higher. ","Larry Culp","I think, with respect to 2020, John, given all the moving pieces we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times here during Q&A, we would probably not want to speculate on what might have been. I think, Jamie gives you a pretty good jumping off point, right? Just taking the 2.3 that we printed, the 1.4 that was held off and then the growth that we would have seen there, was there a deduct [ph] there relative to maybe an offset and service very, very hard to tell. But I think, if you just step back from the MAX, if you look at aviation for 2020, again, I think that the outlook there\u2019s probably flat to up from a free cash perspective, mindful of all the moving pieces here, in and around that. So, again, a strong franchise, a number of other non-MAX-related efforts with real traction delivering real results. We\u2019ll deal with MAX as it comes, but long-term, clearly this is going to be our strongest cash generating business across the portfolio.","Steve Winoker","Brandon, we\u2019re past the hour. Can we just take one more question, please?","Operator","Yes. Our last question is from Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So, Larry, the Healthcare Day in December, you suggested that Healthcare revenue in Q4 to be flat to slightly down, and you came in just about flat. Have you seen any positive inflection in Healthcare Systems, either in the U.S. or some of the delays you were seeing under in China with the new leadership you have there and as trade issues began to die down? And how does the coronavirus complicate the outlook if at all for your China Healthcare Systems business in 2020?","Larry Culp","Andy, I would say that it\u2019s probably too early to point to anything in these numbers today within Healthcare that suggests Yihao in China and Everett here in the States have had positive impact yet. But, in terms of everything I have seen, if you will, behind the curtain, the work they're doing to retool their teams, the commercial intensity and discipline they're bringing, I am really optimistic that the commercial execution that has caused us to underperform on a relative basis in 2019 is on its way to being remedied. And we should see improvement as we go through the course of the year. I was with the European team just last week in France, that's a strong team as well, in many respects a more challenging market. But, we need to deliver on that, not just talk about it.","With respect to corona -- the coronavirus, obviously we're disheartened and sorry that it's happening. It's a tragedy in its own right. Our priority is on safety clearly of our team really across GE. As you might imagine, our Healthcare team is really in the smack in the middle of this in Wuhan and elsewhere, servicing our equipment, certainly prioritizing new equipment deliveries, particularly to the Wuhan hospitals. We've made a significant donation of patient monitors and ultrasound equipment to help the care providers there. So, there is a lot going on. And fortunately, we can be part of the solution there in China, but itself a real tragedy.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Winoker, I\u2019ll turn it back to you for closing remarks.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, everybody. I appreciate you taking the time. I know it\u2019s a busy earnings day, and look forward to following up afterwards. Take care.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"10144":["General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q2 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call July 20, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Matt Cribbins - VP, Investor Communications","John Flannery - Chairman and CEO","Jamie Miller - CFO","Analysts","Scott Davis - Melius Research","Andy Kaplowitz - Citigroup","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank","Julian Mitchell - Barclays","Steven Winoker - UBS","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Christine and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Good morning and welcome to GE\u2019s second quarter earnings webcast. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, John Flannery; CFO, Jamie Miller; and our new Head of IR Todd Ernst.","Before we start, I would like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our investor website at www.ge.com\/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","And now, I will turn the call over to John Flannery.","John Flannery","Thanks, Matt.","The second quarter was an important one for GE. We\u2019ve described 2018 as a reset year; and in the quarter, we made significant progress on that journey. At an overall Company level, we laid out our path to a simpler and stronger GE by announcing our broad portfolio of strategy going forward to drive shareholder value. The core of GE will consist of our Aviation, Power and Renewables businesses. We also announced our plans to move our Healthcare, BHGE and Transportation businesses out of the GE core to enable and pursue more focused growth strategies as standalone companies.","We made significant ongoing progress on our tactical priorities. We have now closed the sales of Industrial Solutions and Value-Based Care. We also announced the merger of our Transportation business with Wabtec and our sale of Distributed Power. This essentially completes the announcement or actual closing of our target of $20 billion of dispositions. We moved on this with deliberation but with an eye for value as well. We are materially shrinking the size of GE Capital with planned asset reductions of $25 billion over the next two years. We continue to take out structural costs. We\u2019ve achieved $1.1 billion in cost out through the first six months, and we are on track to exceed our goal of $2 billion. We also announced changes in our operating model that allow us to take out an additional $500 million plus at Corporate by 2020.","The aviation market continues to be very strong. We had a strong orders quarter and a good week at the Farnborough airshow with $22.6 billion of wins. The biggest challenge we face continues to be working through the turnaround of our Power business. The market continues to be difficult with softness in orders putting pressure on our cash flow and working capital. The team continues to focus on rightsizing footprint, reducing base cost, improving quality, and maximizing value of our installed base. This transformation is taking place in the context of a very dynamic macro environment. Overall, economic activity remains solid in most parts of the world. I made trips to Europe and to China and Korea in the past six weeks, and we continue to watch the global trade picture carefully. Our businesses see significant opportunities, both in Europe and Asia. And it was also a chance for me to see the very strong GE teams winning on the ground.","In terms of business performance in the quarter, our overall results were in line with our expectations. Adjusted EPS was $0.19 with particularly performances in Aviation and Healthcare and a good performance in Oil and Gas. Free cash flow was $258 million, about what we expected for the quarter. Through the first half, cash is about $1 billion better than last year. I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re executing well on cash, meeting or beating our plan across all businesses, except Power. Given that ongoing market challenges and related volatility in Power, we anticipate free cash flow will be approximately $6 billion for the year. Orders were up 1% organically. Organic revenue was down 6%. And margins were down 80 basis points organically. And I\u2019ll share more details on those metrics in the next few pages.","Overall, we are executing on our framework and the plan we laid out for you in June. This plan was built around driving shareholder value by focusing the portfolio for growth, delevering and derisking the Company and operating in a new, decentralized manner. The team is energized by our path forward. And we made solid progress in the first half of the year and will continue to execute. We expect earnings and cash pressure in Power will be offset by strength in Aviation and Healthcare, and lower corporate cost. Renewables, Transportation, and Oil and Gas should be about as expected. Our current rollup for EPS is as at the low end of the range we\u2019ve guided to of $1 to $1.07.","And next on to orders. First quarter orders totaled $31 billion, up 11% reported and up 1% organically. Equipment and services orders were both up 1% organically. We saw strength in equipment orders in Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation. Power was down 29% and Renewables was down 34% on tougher comps. We had good service orders growth in five of seven businesses with strong spares in Aviation and repower in Renewables. Power services declined 22%.","I\u2019ll take you through some of the market highlights on the right. As I said earlier, Power remains challenging. First half trends continue to point to a market less than 30 gigawatts in 2018, which is down from 34 gigawatts last year and 48 gigawatts in 2016. We are planning for the environment to be in this range through 2020. In Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables, we see a lot of opportunities for growth. Aviation markets are robust. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 6.8% year-to-date with strong growth, both domestically and internationally. Air freight volumes grew 5.3%. Load factors continue to be strong. As I mentioned earlier, we had another very successful week in Farnborough. David and the team led the airshow with $22.6 billion of orders and commitments.","In Healthcare, we saw strength in the U.S., up 6% organically and emerging markets up 5%. Europe continues to see modest growth, up 2%. I was with our Healthcare team in China last week, and they had another strong quarter with orders up 10%. The market continues to be robust and the team recently launched the Pioneer MR that helped contribute the 19% MR growth in China. Our Renewables orders were down in the quarter, but we continue to see strong global demand for Onshore Wind. Our onshore backlog is up 43% year-over-year. And although pricing remains challenging, it is improving. Overall, the majority of the markets we are in are strong and growing, and we see good opportunity for growth.","Next, I will go through our results on revenue, margins and costs. Industrial segment revenues were $29 billion, up 4% reported and down 6% organic. The difference is due mainly to the impact of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Aviation saw very strong growth of 13% and Healthcare was up 4%. As expected, Power, Oil and Gas, Transportation and Renewables had negative organic revenues. Jamie will walk through each of the businesses in more detail.","Industrial margins were 10.4% in the second quarter, down 160 basis points. Organically, margins were down 80 basis points in the quarter, but are up 40 basis points for the half on strong cost out. Aviation margins were down 110 basis points on higher LEAP shipments, but are up 110 basis points at the half. We expect Aviation margins will expand in the year. Power margins were down 500 basis points in the quarter, primarily due to lower volume in price. Structural cost reduction remains on track. We reduced cost, an additional $300 million in the second quarter, bringing the total for the first half to $1.1 billion versus our full year target of $2 billion.","We continue to look aggressively at all cost out opportunities. We\u2019ve begun implementing the actions we outlined in June to run the Company with the businesses as the center of gravity. This will result in at least $500 million of incremental corporate cost out through 2020. And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Jamie.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, John.","On the consolidated results, second quarter revenues were $30.1 billion up 3% reported. Industrial revenues were $27.7 billion, up 4% reported with the industrial segments also up 4% but down 6% organically. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.19, down 10% from the second quarter of 2017. The industrial businesses delivered $0.21 of EPS, down 9%, driven by continued softness in Power, partially offset by strength in Aviation and Healthcare. GE Capital contributed negative $0.02 in the quarter, which I\u2019ll cover later in the GE Capital results.","Continuing EPS was $0.08 and included $0.15 of costs related to restructuring and other, non-operating pension and benefit costs, and tax charges related to the planned separation of GE Healthcare. It also includes $0.05 of gains and other marks, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail on the next page. Net EPS of $0.07 includes discontinued operations. Adjusted industrial free cash flow was $258 million for the quarter, down by about $100 million from prior year. I will walk through more details on our cash performance on the next couple of pages.","The reported GE tax rate was 39%, which was higher than previously expected due to the approximate $200 million tax charge to restructure our operations related to the planned separation of GE Healthcare. The adjusted industrial tax rate was 18%.","On the right side of the segment results, industrial segment op profit was down 4%, driven by double-digit declines in Power, Renewables and Transportation, partially offset by solid growth in Aviation and Healthcare. Industrial operating profit, which includes Corporate, was down 11%. Through the half industrial segment op profit was down 3%.","Next, I will go through a walk of earnings per share. Net EPS was $0.07 including losses and discontinued operations of $0.01 related to trailing cost from the GE Capital exit plan and the reserve for an unfavorable tax resolution related to a prior disposition. EPS from continuing operations was $0.08, this included $0.02 of gains primarily related to the sale of Industrial Solutions to ABB. On industrial restructuring and other item, we incurred $0.08 of charges; $0.05 was related to ongoing cost out actions at Corporate, Power and Renewables. We also incurred a $0.01 in our Oil and Gas segment, which represents our portion of Baker Hughes GE\u2019s restructuring, and $0.03 related to the planned separation of GE Healthcare and the small impact related to other tax reform adjustments.","For the year, we expect restructuring to be about $2.7 billion pretax, ex-Baker Hughes GE. In the quarter, we also had a $0.02 favorable mark-to-market related to our equity investment in Pivotal. The company IPOed in April; and as required by GAAP accounting for equity securities, we marked our investment to fair value, based on the publicly traded share price as of the end of June. This non-operating item is not included in our $1 to $1.07 EPS guidance for the year. Any future marks for this investment will continue to be backed out of our adjusted EPS each quarter in 2018. Finally, non-operating pension and benefit costs were $0.06, which gets you to an adjusted EPS of $0.19.","Next, I\u2019ll cover cash. Our total industrial free cash flow was negative $600 million in the quarter. This represents total GE, including 100% of Baker Hughes GE free cash flow. Adjusting for pension plan contributions, deal taxes and Baker Hughes GE on a dividend basis, our adjusted industrial free cash flow was $258 million. This was up significantly from the negative cash flow of $1.7 billion that we reported last quarter.","Adjusted industrial free cash flow year-to-date was negative $1.4 billion and that is up $1 billion compared to last year. Overall, second quarter free cash flow performance was in line with expectations. Continued weakness in Power was offset by strength in other business segments.","If we continue on the right, you can see the drivers of the second quarter cash performance. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.2 billion. Working capital usage was negative $900 million for the quarter. The primary driver was net liquidation of progress collections in our Power segment, reflecting a challenging new orders dynamic. Excluding Power, working capital was flat, indicative of a normal business cycle and the other businesses. We saw a cash usage in these businesses through buildup of receivables and inventory, which was funded by a similar increase in payables and progress collections.","Contract assets were a cash usage of $500 million this quarter, driven by $400 million of deferred inventory build in our Renewables segment due to timing of units that were shipped but not rev rec. We expect to recognize these units in the second half. In addition, we had about $300 million of usage in our long-term services agreements portfolio, primarily driven by revenue in excess of billings. This was partially offset by $200 million of cash collections ahead of revenue on equipment contracts. Other cash flows were flat in the period.","We spent $800 million in capital expenditures to support growth in our business segments. This was down $300 million versus prior year, reflecting our focus on rightsizing investment spend. For the year, the continued challenges we are seeing in power are putting pressure on our total year adjusted industrial free cash flow outlook. We currently expect it to be about $6 billion, reflecting the tougher Power market dynamics, which is offsetting strength in other businesses.","Cash on hand ex-Baker Hughes GE of $8.9 billion is down $2.9 billion versus year-end. At the half, we\u2019ve used $1.4 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and have paid out $2.1 billion in quarterly dividend. We received $2.3 billion in cash from business dispositions, primarily from the sale of our Industrial Solutions business to ABB that closed this quarter. Additionally, we had 1.1 billion of investing activity, primarily related to $900 million of activity in our Aviation business in the first quarter where we acquired IP assets for $700 million as well as a minority shareholding in Arcam for $200 million, one of our additive businesses.","Debt went up by $800 million, primarily driven by debt related to pension funding. And as we had previously disclosed, we will be making total contributions of $6 billion in 2018 to our U.S principal pension plan, which includes contributions in the first half of $900 million. These contributions are being funded by utilizing excess debt in GE Capital. The $1.3 billion change in other is comprised of $900 million of pension plan funding made this year that I previously mentioned, as well as other timing items during the year. We plan to end the year at more than $15 billion of cash. The principal drivers in the second half are free cash flow and dividends for the remainder of the year. In addition, we are expecting to receive approximately $5 billion from disposition proceeds and will have cash usage from the exercise of the $3 billion of Alstom puts in the fourth quarter.","Now, I will take you through the second quarter results by segment. For Power, orders of $7.4 billion were down 26% with equipment down 29% and services down 22%. Equipment was down, primarily in gas power systems, which was down 78%. This was driven by lower gas turbine orders of 7 units versus 24 last year, lower balance of plant, down 600 million, and less aero derivatives orders of 3 versus 12 last year. We have 82 gas turbine units in backlog, including 33 H units. Services orders were down 22% and down 17% excluding the water disposition. Contractual orders were down 5%, principally on lower upgrades and averages. Transactional orders were down 30%, driven by lower upgrades in parts.","Revenue of $7.6 billion was down 19% with both equipment and services down double digits. Lower equipment revenues were driven by gas turbine shipments of 7 versus 21 units, and aero units of 5 versus 17 in the prior year. We expect to ship about 50 gas turbines this year with 90% in backlog today. Aero shipments are estimated to be around 30 units with about 55% in backlog. Shipments for both are in line with total year expectations.","Services revenues were down 15% and down 8% excluding water. CSA revenue was down 8% on lower outages, unfavorable mix of contract scope, and lower long-term service agreement gain. Utilization on CSA units continues to perform as expected and in line with last year. Transactional services revenues were down 21% on fewer upgrades and outages. Transactional revenues were also impacted by several large transactions of about $200 million where commercial closure moved to the second half. In total, services revenue should be stronger in the second half. However, we will continue to have year-over-year pressure from CSA outage and contract mix.","Operating profit of $421 million was down on lower volume price and unfavorable productivity and mix. Structural cost-out totaled $212 million in the quarter and $566 million for the first half. We are on track for $1 billion of cost out for the total year end.","The Power business had another challenging quarter. As John mentioned, the market continues to be soft, and we have seen new orders in both gas turbines and aero derivatives moving out to the second half. We have visibility to a solid pipeline of activity in the second half. However, the timing of closing on these orders remains difficult to forecast. We expect orders to be better in the second half versus the first half, and about flat with last year. We\u2019re making progress on operational improvements, but this is a multiyear process.","Our lead time on H turbines is down about 15% and we have implemented ERP systems that will provide greater visibility earlier on cost positions and scheduling issues in our project business. We continue to make progress on upgrading our transactional service technical sales and capabilities. We have visibility to 90% of the non-CSA GE units over the last year and have initiated commercial actions on 80% of these units.","We are focused on gaining traction in winning new business with transactional revenues up 5% for the first half. We expect to see improvement in the second half, especially as we move into the fourth quarter. As is typical with this business, as we look to the second half, we are backend loaded to the fourth quarter. No change to our prior comments on Power performance for the year, but clearly we are very focused on operational change and improvements.","On Renewables, orders were down 15% in the quarter, driven principally by Onshore Wind down 18% on lower wind turbine volume and down 44% on unit. This was partially offset by higher onshore service orders, up 2.6 times versus last year. The decline in wind turbine orders is principally driven by timing. Year-to-date Onshore Wind orders are flat with last year. Pricing for new units in the quarter improved sequentially, but were still lower than last year. Backlog for the total business grew 32% to $16.5 billion with onshore up 43%. Revenues were down 29%, principally on lower Onshore Wind turbine deliveries, down 54% on units. This was partially offset by onshore services up 44%.","Operating profit was down 48%, driven by lower volume and unfavorable pricing, partially offset by better cost performance. Backlog continues to expand in this business, based on strength in Onshore Wind. The team is investing and building capacity and is very focused on ensuring that we have the capability to deliver on a large second half ramp-up in shipments. The Onshore Wind business has about 70% of the expected second half new units in repower sales in backlog today, with good visibility to the remaining 30%. This along with continued strong service growth should put us on track for revenue growth in line with our prior guidance, 7% to 10% organic. We continue to bring product costs down, and we expect to see benefit from those actions, as we deliver volume in the second half.","Next, on Aviation. Orders in the quarter were up 29% to $9.5 billion. Equipment orders grew 62%, driven by commercial engine orders which were up 90% as a result of key wins in GEnx, up 9x; and continued LEAP momentum, up 37%. Military engine orders were up 19%, largely driven by U.S. Navy 414 order. Service orders grew 9%. Not included in orders are $22.6 billion of wins at list price for GE and CFM from the Farnborough airshow with engines of about $19 billion and services of about $4 billion. We saw a significant activity in key commercial engine segments including LEAP with $12 billion of when and GEnx and GE 90 of $5 billion. Revenues in the quarter grew 13% to $7.5 billion. Equipment revenue was up 24% on higher commercial and military engine shipments.","We shipped 250 LEAP engines this quarter with improving cost positions versus 69, a year ago and 186 in the prior quarter. Services revenues grew 8%, with the spares rate of 26.6 million per day, up 23% versus prior year. This was partially offset by lower CSA revenue. Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 7% on higher volume, improved year-over-year price, and operating productivity. Operating profit margins were pressured by 110 basis points in the quarter, principally due to unfavorable mix on higher LEAP shipments.","As I said earlier, we shipped 250 LEAP engines in the quarter. And for the first half, we have delivered 436 versus 459 for all of 2017. We are about four weeks behind schedule but are making good progress on our commitment to recover on LEAP deliveries by year-end and remain on track for 1,100 to 1,200 engines in 2018. For the year, David and the team are on track to deliver 15-plus-percent op profit growth.","Next, on Healthcare. Orders of $5.3 billion were up 7% and 5% organically. Geographically, organic orders were up 6% in the U.S and 2% in Europe. Emerging market organic orders were up 5% with China up 10%. On a product line basis, Life Sciences orders were up 12% reported and 9% organic with bioprocess strong, up 14% organic. Healthcare Systems orders were up 6% reported and 4% organically. Healthcare revenues of $5 billion grew 6% reported and 4% on an organic basis with Healthcare Systems up 4% and Life Sciences up 5%. Emerging markets continue to be strong, up 10% organically, while developed markets were up 2%.","Operating profit of $926 million was up 12% reported and 10% organic, driven by continued volume growth in productivity. Margins expanded 100 basis points in the quarter as material deflation and cost productivity more than offset price pressure. The Healthcare team is making progress on portfolio actions. The sale of the Value-Based Care portfolio of Healthcare Digital to Veritas Capital was completed on July 10th.","Next on Oil and Gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45, and Lorenzo and his team will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:30. Since we had the one year anniversary of the merger of Oil and Gas with Baker Hughes in July, this will be the last quarter that I provide a comparison of the combined business based on financials as if the merger had taken place on 1\/1 of 2017. For reference, I\u2019ll give you the total organic orders and revenue comparisons as well. These represent the results of our legacy Oil and Gas business.","Orders were $6 billion, up 95% reported and up 2% organic. On a combined basis, orders were up 9%. The Oil and Gas market continues to grow as crude oil prices have remained relatively stable. Our short cycle businesses are already benefiting from this, which is driving the growth this quarter, particularly in the upstream oilfield services business, which was up 13% year-over-year. Our outlook for long cycle is becoming more constructive, and we saw a good growth in oilfield equipment orders which were up 30% on a large award from Chevron for the Gorgon stage 2 project. This was offset partially by turbomachinery and process solutions down 4% and digital solutions down 6%.","Revenues were $5.6 billion, up 85% reported and down 12% organic. On a combined business basis, revenues were up 2%. Short cycle oilfield services and digital solutions revenues were up 14% and 7%, respectively, while the longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery and process solutions were down 9% and 13%, respectively. Operating profit was $222 million, up 86% reported and down about 27% organic, driven by declines in our longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses, partially offset by synergy.","During the quarter, cash distributions from BHGE totaled $439 million, including the share repurchases and the quarterly dividend of $125 million. Lorenzo and Brian will provide more details on their call today. We are pleased with the team\u2019s execution on strategic goals of growing share and improving cash and margins. The integration is going well with 189 million of synergies in the quarter and is on track for 700 million for the year.","Next, on Transportation. North American carload volume was up 5% in the quarter, primarily driven by intermodal carloads up 7% and commodity carloads up 4%. Parked locomotives continued to improve, ending the quarter down about 31% from last year. Orders of $1.1 billion were up 42% with equipment orders of $486 million, up 110%. We received orders for 115 locomotives, principally from North American customers versus 26 in the second quarter of \u201817. Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in mining wheels with unit orders up 115%.","Services orders of $620 million were up 13%, driven by double-digit growth in both locomotives and mining. Backlog was up $300 million versus prior year to $18.3 billion with equipment up 30% and services down 7%. Revenues of $942 million were down 13% with equipment down 40% on lower loco volume. We shipped 7 North American locomotives this quarter versus 37 in the second quarter of 2017. International unit shipments were 47 in the quarter versus 83 in the second quarter of \u201817. This was partially offset by mining, which was up 109%. Services revenue was up 12%, driven by locomotive and mining parts growth.","Operating profit of $155 million was down 15% due to lower locomotive volume, partly offset by services growth. We announced in May that our transportation business will be merging with Wabtec. The deal is progressing and we expect it to close in early 2019.","Moving over to Lighting. Revenues for the segment were down 9% with Current up 6% and the legacy lighting business down 26%. Revenues for the segment were up 6% organically. Operating profit was $24 million, up from $17 million last year. In the second quarter, we closed on the majority of our sale of our Europe, Middle East, Africa, Turkey and global automotive lighting businesses. These businesses represented approximately 15% of Current and Lighting\u2019s annual revenues. We expect to sign a deal to sell the remainder of Current and Lighting by the end of 2018.","Finally, I will cover GE Capital. Continuing operations generated a loss of $207 million in the quarter, down 20%. We had a $38 million charge associated with the upfront cost of calling approximately $700 million of excess debt, which will be accretive by the end of 2019. Compared to last year, the business recorded lower gains and higher impairments, primarily related to EFS, which was mostly offset by higher base earnings and lower cost. As mentioned previously, for the year, we\u2019re targeting to be about breakeven on continuing net income. We expect to have higher income in the second half, driven by lower excess debt costs, incremental tax benefits in the fourth quarter and additional asset sale gains. The timing of asset sales could impact the exact outcome.","GE Capital ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets including $16 billion of liquidity. We paid down $7 billion of long-term during the quarter and reduced our commercial paper program by $1 billion, which is in line with our overall capital allocation framework.","As we announced in January, we modified on July 1st, the internal GE Capital preferred stock to be mandatorily convertible into common equity in January 2021. Remember, this was a back-to-back arrangement with GE. So, the modification does not change the terms of the external GE preferred stock. In January 2021, the GE preferred stock becomes callable, and we will make a decision about this as part of our overall capital structure at that time. Our strategy with respect to GE Capital remains clear. We intend to materially shrink the balance sheet of GE Capital. We\u2019re making progress on our target reduction of $25 billion in energy and industrial finance assets by the end of 2019. We sold approximately $2 billion of assets in the second quarter and expect to exit more than $10 billion of assets in the second half.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to John.","John Flannery","Thanks, Jamie. In summary, we see continued strength in Aviation, Healthcare and corporate costs in the second half. This will offset pressure in Power. Renewables, Transportation and Oil and Gas should be about as expected. Cost out was $1.1 billion in the first half, on track to be better than $2 billion target. We are aggressively reviewing all cost out opportunities for the second half. We are targeting GE Capital earnings to be breakeven for the total year due to portfolio actions. We expect the second half to be better than the first half.","GE is on a multiyear transformational journey, and the path forward is clear. Overall, we feel good about our execution. We see strength across the majority of the portfolio. We remain focused on implementing the broad macro strategic changes we outlined in June, while making sure our micro execution in each business continues to improve across the Company.","And with that Matt, I will turn it back over to you.","Matt Cribbins","Thanks, John. With that, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis of Melius Research. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Great. Thanks, operator. Good morning, guys and gals. The Power business, it continues to get a bit worse it seems, and the news flow just continues to get worse. I guess, the question is, the original restructuring plan, when you look at it now, is it enough, and can you get enough? With the agreements that you have with the French government, is it even possible to take out enough capacity to get close to matching up supply and demand on that?","John Flannery","So, Scott, let me just start out saying, it\u2019s clearly our top priority, is managing through and fixing our issues in the Power business. So, we\u2019re working that intensely, in total sense of urgency. The market is challenging, but we need to work through that. It\u2019s going to be a multiyear fix, I think with some volatility. This is not something that\u2019s going to move straight line quarter-to-quarter. But, let me take it in three pieces really, one is just the market; two is now we\u2019re fixing it; and then, just as we look into \u201819 and beyond. I\u2019ll start with market. So, we\u2019re looking basically 50% down last two years, we\u2019re planning for this to stay at those levels. So, we\u2019re not looking for any rebound there.","On the installed base side, the industry is not going way. I think, if you look at every forecast, recent forecast, Bloomberg and others that the amount of electricity generated by gas turbines will increase. So, we think there is something substantial to build around it longer term here, and our strategy is to restructure the business and maximize the value.","We\u2019ve got five basic things, Scott, in the plan here in terms of addressing this. One is rightsizing the footprint and the base cost. I think, the team made good progress on that. We\u2019re about 550 and $560 million of cost out in the first half; we\u2019ll be ahead of the target on $1 billion out.","Then maximizing value of installed base, again, we\u2019ve gone through that with you before, but we continue to make progress and thinking, improving our visibility, improving our commercial execution, sales incentives pricing controls. So, I think the team -- we\u2019ve got execution and quality and then liquidated damages and in cycle time. Selling core -- non-core assets IS sold, BP announced, low voltage motors and changes to management. So, we see a very clear plan of what we need to do there.","The market continues to be a challenge. And so, what we announced today, Scott, was this -- we see pressure on orders. We\u2019re going to continue to have to take additional cost out. We\u2019re going to continue to have to restructure the footprint. We can do that. We will do that. But, it\u2019s going to take some time. So, I don\u2019t see any change to our core strategy with the business, our core approach to what we see in the market. But, I agree with your point that it\u2019s going to take more ongoing actions here, and that\u2019s what the team is focused on.","And I think as we look beyond 2019 and beyond, we\u2019re already working with an assumption of a very challenging market. So, we had 107 gas turbines last year, we\u2019re about half of that this year, we\u2019re not expecting any improvement on that. We have the commercial teams intensely focused and getting our fair share, but make sure we\u2019re disciplined on the terms of that. And we just continue to grind down the footprint and the base cost. So, I think, big picture, the industry is not going away, the short-term cycle is severe, and we\u2019ve got to manage through that. But there has been asset worth maintaining and preserving and expanding the value here.","Scott Davis","Just quickly, you guys haven\u2019t really given us a number yet on what you think the run rate corporate expense is, once all the Healthcare spend and Transportation, once it all occurs. I mean, what -- do you have a sense of how much it takes in pure dollars of sense to run a company like GE from a corporate perspective?","Jamie Miller","Yes, Scott. From a corporate perspective, so, for this year, we\u2019re looking at between 1.2 and $1.3 billion of corporate. Back on June 26th, we announced both externally and internally a number of changes to our corporate structure. First, was really decentralizing a lot of what is done at corporate today, and both moving folks to the businesses as well as a number of headcount reductions. I\u2019d say, the second thing is we had historically run a lot of things centrally here at corporate as well, and that is all getting pushed out to the businesses, things like global growth, things like ventures, things like IT and other shared services. So, as you look at that, part of that as well was to announce at least $500 million in incremental cost out over the next two years. And those are auctioned; we\u2019re in the process of really laying out the execution for that right now. And that really starts now and into the second half.","John Flannery","I\u2019d just add, Scott, on that just as a matter of philosophy. I\u2019m deeply committed to philosophy that the corporate center should be significantly smaller and really focused only on governance, on talent, on capital allocation strategy. So, a radical resizing of what it\u2019s been in the past.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz of Citigroup. Please go ahead. ","Andy Kaplowitz","John and Jamie, can you give us some more of an update on GE Capital in a sense that -- you mentioned some smaller impairments in EFS, you give us more color on those, and you said you still expect the GE Capital to be breakeven for the year with the decent ramp up in the second half. Has visibility decreased at all in that our targeted, give your results in 2Q, or do you still see a nice ramp in second half gains to get you there, and I assume no new update in WMC at this point? ","Jamie Miller","Yes. So, on GE Capital, we\u2019re targeting roughly breakeven. That really hasn\u2019t change from our earlier conversations. That could vary based on the timing of asset sales. We do expect fourth quarter tax planning benefits like we had in the past, and assets sale gains. I think, one important thing to note in the first half versus the second half is, as we\u2019ve begun the process of asset sales and we\u2019re doing pricing discovery, we often have to take marks or impairments on specific assets where there may be a loss on sale, but those gains we have to differ until the actual sale happens. And so, that gain portion of it really flushes through in the second half. We will also see lower excess interest cost. You saw we had a number of debt maturities in the first half. So, still targeting roughly breakeven for GE Capital, but again, timing of some of that could vary, and that\u2019s a rough guide. On WMC, I would say, at this point, really not change to what we talked about before.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Sprague","Just two quick ones for me; first on the restructuring in 2018. I was wondering how much of the $2.7 billion you would label as actual kind of cost out restructuring relative to write-offs, the GE Healthcare charge and the like. And then the second question, I was just wondering on looking at the Aviation margins -- sequentially, pretty significant drop on sequential spares growth and a little bit of lift in LEAP volumes but not materially. So, just trying to get a better handle on how aviation looks for the year. Jamie, I think you said up 15% in OP. Is that correct and kind of what\u2019s the revenue trajectory associated with that? Thank you.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So, let me start with the restructuring, and I\u2019m going to talk about restructuring, including Baker Hughes GE. So, restructuring for the year at this point, we expect to be about $3.2 billion. That includes about $500 million of Baker Hughes GE. When you really break that down, of that 3.2, we see roughly 2.6 being related to headcount reductions, site closures, other facility exits, things like that. We do have a heavier run rate of what I\u2019ll call BD and transaction-related costs this year. Just as you know, we\u2019ve announced our $20 billion of dispositions. We are working through the other portfolio changes. So, we do see things like carve out audits, transaction fees and other things rolling through there as well. So, that\u2019s that piece of it.","Just shifting to Aviation for a minute. Let me start with -- for the full year, we expect Aviation to have positive margin uplift, and that\u2019s consistent with the 15-plus op margin discussion we\u2019ve had before. But just looking at second quarter in particular, we saw a couple of things here. So, first, sequentially, we had 64 more LEAP engines in second quarter versus first quarter. But if you look at second quarter year-over-year that ramp was really 3 to 4x. So, that was really a significant pull and really impacted margins in the second quarter.","When you start to look at the second half, LEAP continues to come down the cost curve. So, while volume continues to ramp up, we\u2019re seeing a nice benefit continuing in terms of the cost piece of it. On the services side, we are seeing some higher turnaround times in our shops, just given the volume ramp and which is resulting in higher shop costs. We saw some of that in the second quarter. The team is taking very specific action on that. And we expect some of that services pressure to continue in the second half, but not at the same level. Remember, we\u2019ve got a very strong spares rate we\u2019re seeing right now, and we expect that to continue. But bottom line is, when you put all that together, we expect full-year margins to go up. But second quarter definitely has some shifting, especially with that year-over-year comparison in LEAP.","John Flannery","And I\u2019d just add just as a macro comment on the Aviation business overall. This continues to be an extremely strong asset. I think, if you look at markets conditions, they are extremely good in commercial, extremely good in -- freight frankly picking up, good in military. We have a very strong team. The team is working through the LEAP launch well. David went through that at the Farnborough show this week in terms of our delivery schedules and being on track with our delivery schedules that are on track, coming down the cost curve as well on a per unit cost. So, we\u2019ve got I think a good market, a very strong franchise. We continue to clearly outperform on the orders and with customers, and a very strong team running that business with a great execution track record. So, when I step back and look at our portfolio of businesses, this one remains a premium business with a very good and visible long-term outlook.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","I guess, I have two questions, one related to Farnborough and other one related to Power, both on services. There was a quote on Bloomberg from one of your colleagues I think, one of your aftermarket folks about some sort of MRO sharing arrangement with Boeing, it was fairly vague, but I\u2019m just trying to understand is that the direction you\u2019re going. And second, if you could just provide more color as to when you guys think transactional business is going to bottom in terms of revenues. Thank you.","John Flannery","I\u2019m not familiar with the comments Andrew on the Boeing MRO strategy. So, that sounds off point to us, but we\u2019ll follow-up with you on that one.","On the transactional services business, I assume you are referring to the Power side of things. And I would just say, it\u2019s a longer cycle process. So, you are dealing essentially with coverage of our installed base and coverage of outages. So, our first step obviously has been trying to drive visibility into our installed base, that\u2019s upto about 90% right now from quite low levels. We\u2019ve got about 80% of those sites with commercial processes and commercial bids being worked on. So, this is something that\u2019s going to unfold over the next several quarters. But, I think the tactical steps upfront around visibility, commercial intensity, sales incentives, the building blocks if you will of something that can unfold over the next several quarters, the team feels good about what they\u2019re doing there. So, it will take some time but it\u2019s an opportunity for us. Margin rates were up I think about 400 basis points on the CM line and transactional. So, we got some work we can do on pricing and product quality and things. But, it will take several quarters I think for this to unfold.","Jamie Miller","And Andrew, I would just add on the transactional piece of it. We did see lower core volume in the quarter with fewer outages. But, the other piece just take into consideration is that upgrades were down close to 50% year-over-year, as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Tusa of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","I just want to thank Matt for all the help over the years. He was extremely diligent with us. So, I really appreciate his help. So, thanks, Matt. So, just two questions. The first one on Aviation just to kind of clarify. And I think you\u2019ve made a lot of comments on the call about third quarter, fourth quarter. Given that seasonality has probably changed a little bit with the new accounting, it\u2019s a little bit unclear how we\u2019re supposed to kind of think about Aviation seasonally. Would you expect it in the third quarter to be down, flat or up relative to the second quarter from a profit perspective at Aviation?","Jamie Miller","Yes. We see the second half with the volume -- sorry, we see strong services continue; we see third quarter being up versus second quarter sequentially.","Steve Tusa","Third quarter being up versus second quarter. Okay, great. And then on the restructuring side, so $2.6 billion is -- how much of that is actual headcount?","Jamie Miller","I don\u2019t have that split with me. We\u2019ll have to follow up with you after that. But of that $2.6 billion, Steve, all of that relates to investment spend we make against headcount reduction, site and facility closure, and other costs out actions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","So, I guess two questions for you. The first is just a high level question. If you could just kind of comment a little bit on the work you\u2019ve done around potential impact from all of the tariff activity that\u2019s been thrown around over the past few months, and if there is risk to your guidance associated with that? And then, the second thing is just thinking about the Power ramp in the second half of the year. How much of that improvement is underwritten by restructuring actions that have already been taken? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the risk if we see further deterioration in the top-line?","John Flannery","Okay, Nicole. Let me take the China tariff situation, and then Jamie can follow up on the Power thing. I think, just on the -- let me give you some context really on our business in China first and then how we see this unfolding.","So, we import about $29 billion of goods globally into the U.S., about 10% of that comes from China. And our business in China, we do about $7 billion, little over $7 billion of revenue in China, and the majority of that is in our Aviation and Healthcare business. If you go and look at the actual tariffs, the $50 billion that are announced and implemented and $200 billion announced but not implemented yet. I would say, we look at it sort of a gross and a net basis. So, it could be $300 million to $400 million at a gross level before any mitigating factors are taken there. And there are some significant mitigating factors. The first is what\u2019s called duty drawbacks. And these are basically credits for any components and things that we would import from China and ultimately reexport as part of the gas turbine, or an MRI machine or an aircraft engine. And that\u2019s a significant amount of what we import. So, we think that could mitigate half or more of what the tariff picture is there. And then obviously over time, we also can adjust our supply chain in response to some of these issues if that\u2019s what made sense.","So, I\u2019d say, we don\u2019t see a major impact yet financially, certainly not on our \u201818 guidance. But that said, we are a company that\u2019s built for fair and open trade that\u2019s obviously a subject of debate and discussion. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing right now. We\u2019re supportive of a fair and open trade. We have a massively global business in every sense, both customers, supply chains, everything. So, in our view right now as we hope and we expect that ultimately these matters reach a sensible negotiated conclusion, and we think that\u2019s really in the best interest of all parties involved. So, we\u2019re watching this carefully. But, I think the financial parameters of this, we\u2019ve got a good handle on. And then, Jaime, do you want to comment on Power question?","Jamie Miller","Sure. So just looking at Power first half, second half, I think when you start to look at the second half, one thing to keep in mind is that the fourth quarter of 2017, we had $600 million of one-time items with some inventory write-offs and some other things last year. So, you have to think about that in the comparison first. In the second half, we do see lower gas turbine units, year-over-year. Services, as John mentioned, we do expect to start to see that pick up here in the second half, as the results of Scott\u2019s efforts really start to take hold. Cost out, you asked about, we have a $1 billion cost out program in Power this year. For the first half, we\u2019ve seen about 560, $565 million of cost out already. We expect to see at least that same amount in the second half. But fourth quarter is our biggest quarter. We\u2019ve got the volume being lower, the services ramp coming through, the cost out coming through. And one other thing just to remember on volume is that of our gas turbine volume, about 90% of that is already in backlog. And then, just when we look at the aero units for the second half, we have a very strong pipeline there, but that can be a bit lumpy too.","Operator","Our next question is from Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","So, just a couple of quick questions. One is on the second half free cash flow of about $7.5 billion. Within that portion, how much is really coming from working capital versus the sort of 2 to $2.5 billion outflow in the first half, and I guess how much of that is Power? And then, secondly, you talked a lot about the structural cost out. You had about a $1 billion out or more in the first half firm-wide, but your industrial EBIT is still only flattish year-over-year. So, I guess I\u2019m trying to get a sense of the urgency around the magnitude of stepping up the cost plan, because maybe not that much of it is dropping through to the bottom line.","Jamie Miller","Let me walk you through the second half on the free cash flow and then maybe I\u2019ll touch a little bit on the cost out element, and John may comment as well. So, for the second half on free cash flow, we do see higher earnings across all of the businesses, as we got a very strong volume second half, as you see. With respect to working capital, we see about $3 billion of inventory liquidation coming through in the second half. Really with the shipment profiles we\u2019re seeing across Aviation, Power and Renewables, we continue to expect progress drag at Power but we also expect that to be largely offset by Renewables second half collections as we really start to see that PTC cycle in \u201818, \u201819 and \u201820 ramp.","On contract assets, we had usage in the first half of about $900 million. We expect the usage to be higher in the second half, but lower than the $3 billion usage we had previously planned. So, that\u2019s a little bit there. Just talking about the structural cost piece of it, so $1.1 billion out year-to-date, we still expect the $2 billion plus for the year. When you look at the $1.1 billion and where we\u2019re seeing some shifting in the industrial margin, we are seeing lower volume impacting our margins, primarily at Power that was about $600 million, we\u2019re also seeing mix also affect the margins element, primarily LEAP there, and some FX. So, it is being offset in terms of what you see right now in your operating margins, but again expect the strong half -- the second half as well on both cost control and cost out.","John Flannery","Julian, I\u2019d just say, on the cost side of things, a couple of things here. One is, the cost out initiatives will never end. If we have headwinds in other parts of the business, as Jamie mentioned, that are eating it up, we just have to do more. So, we are looking constantly and aggressively at everything on the cost side of things. So, I think a sense of urgency and our knowledge of the need to execute on that is front and center. I continue to see additional opportunities I think in corporate. We have also gone through with our teams this whole notion of decentralizing corporate, pushing down if you will, or eliminating activity at the corporate level, I expect that\u2019s also happened at the Tier 1 levels in the Power business and the Healthcare business, et cetera. So, I think there\u2019s more to go there. But, this is a self-help execution story for us and the cost is a huge part of that.","Operator","Our last question is from Steven Winoker of UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Winoker","I\u2019ve got just two quick ones. First one is, I know, you guys give us adjusted EPS guidance of a $1 to $1.07, but I think most companies that we cover, tend to give us a GAAP number as well, especially considering all the moving parts around restructuring and everything else. Is there a way you could give us a sense of what that implies from your perspective on GAAP? And then, the second question is around just pricing and the order book, particularly around wind and on the equipment side and Power.","Jamie Miller","So, let me start with the pricing discussion for a minute. Pricing from a Power perspective, as you see, I mean, the market is very soft right now. We\u2019re expecting a flattish market for the next couple of years on Power and there is a lot of over capacity in the market. As you would expect, we\u2019re seeing continued price pressure on equipment in many markets. I would say on the services side, we\u2019re seeing pricing being relatively stable in transactional services. You saw that come through in the first half with orders and revenue on transactional services up 5%. When you start to look at Renewables, a couple of dynamics here. First, we\u2019re still feeling the effects from the European auction environment. So, pricing does continue to be challenging, but we\u2019re seeing it moderate, and we saw that this quarter. As we move into what should be a very strong volume couple of years, we expect that to help the pricing element as well.","John Flannery","I\u2019d just add on the -- with respect to the adjusted earnings topic in general, that\u2019s something I\u2019d ask Jamie and now Todd as he\u2019s coming in here to look at. I understand your point, and I would say expect an update on that later this year.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you. Just as a reminder, John, before you wrap, replay of today\u2019s call will be available this afternoon on our investor website. ","John Flannery","Great. Thanks a lot, Matt. And I, as Steve noted earlier, do want to thank you really for just the tremendous job in this role. You\u2019ve led us through a lot change and movement in the Company and have always been responsive and service oriented to our investors and analysts. So, thank you for an incredible effort and performance there. And we welcome Todd Ernst as well. So, Todd, the baton is passed to you. We have every expectation you will build on that great work.","So, I would just finish really by saying, this is really the one year anniversary, if you will, for me. And as I reflect back, really much progress has been made at the Company. If I look back, I see obviously -- we\u2019ve spent a lot of time working on a very clear strategic direction, positioning the portfolio so that the businesses can thrive, delevering the Company, decentralizing the management approach. So, strong progress on the strategic direction of the business. Good ongoing progress on our tactical execution items. The $20 billion of disposition, cost out, the team continues execute on the day to day things we need to advance things, and a lot of change. Change at the top of the Company in terms of the leadership team, changes in our Board, changes in the culture of the Company, so a lot has happened in 12 months.","As we stand today and just say we look forward and say, the path is clear. This is really a pivot point for us that this is an execution story going forward. We know what we need to do. We know where we want to go. We know what our strengths are and they are significant. And we know what our issues are, and some of those are significant. So, we\u2019re focused on execution going forward. And I\u2019d say, the team is clear where we\u2019re headed, they know what they need to do, they know where they can contribute, they are excited about the path we\u2019re on. In different pieces of the Company up here, different roles to plays, but there is a confidence in the future. And I\u2019m personally certain we\u2019re on the right path. So, as we said, it\u2019s a multiyear journey, but I\u2019m highly confident in the direction we\u2019re. And it\u2019s up to our team to execute and I\u2019m confident in our ability to do that. So, that said and Matt thanks again for a great performance.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Shaquana and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Trevor Schauenberg","Thank you, Shaquana. Good morning, and welcome everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s second quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for the webcast, we issued the press release earlier this morning and the presentation slides are available via the webcast. The slides are available for download and printing on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast we have a large group here. We have our Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt; our Vice Chairman and new CEO of GE Capital, Keith Sherin; and our new CFO for GE, Jeff Bornstein. ","Now let\u2019s turn over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks Trevor. Good morning everybody. On the first page, our environment improved slightly in the second quarter. Emerging markets remained resilient while Europe stabilized. Orders in the US were the strongest we\u2019ve seen in some time with 20% growth and overall our orders grew by 4% and backlog increased to $223 billion. ","Earnings were solid. Reported EPS was $0.36, but this includes $0.02 of uncovered restructuring. On a sustained basis it would have been $0.38, up slightly from 2012. And year-to-date EPS is $0.75, up 6%. ","Operations were strong in the quarter. Margins grew by 50 basis points and we\u2019re on-track for 70 basis points for 2013. Our simplification efforts have resulted in $470 million of costs year-to-date and we had a solid performance in cash. Our disciplined and balanced capital allocation plan continues. Through the half we have return about $10 billion to investors while on the way to our $18 billion goal. As for M&A, we\u2019ve completed Lufkin and Avio and Avio remains on-track for a third quarter close. So, all in all a good quarter for operating and strategic execution.","Our orders growth remained solid at plus 4% and as I said earlier, backlog grew to $223 billion. Performance was broad based. We had services grow in five of our six businesses. Orders growth accelerated in China, the US and Europe. Aviation and oil and gas remained very strong, with their combined backlog growing by $7 billion.","Let me give you a few other highlights. Oil and gas orders grew by 24% with double digit growth in four of five segments. Aviation commercial spare orders grew by 19%. Healthcare Solutions equipment orders grew by 9% in the US. Energy management orders grew by 19%. North American power generation service orders grew by 24%. We still have a few headwinds like heavy duty gas turbines, but there are signs of strength. We continue to add price to backlog with orders pricing up 0.9% and we have now had positive orders priced for the past six quarters. This will contribute to a positive value gap in the second half of 2013 and beyond.","Our organic growth was down 1% for the quarter but it's really a wind turbine story. Organic growth ex- Power & Water grew by 5%. Growth markets expanded by 5% with four of nine regions up by double-digits. We continue to make progress in key regions like Russia, Africa and China. Our growth market position is a competitive advantage for GE. Services grew by 2% with broad-based strength and we are encouraged by services in aviation, oil and gas, and transportation. Transportation services is of particular highlight with growth of 28%.","We continue to be impacted by the sluggish European economy for gas turbine services and U.S. sequestration impacted our military spares business. The service margins grew by 70 basis points and backlog grew to $166 billion. We made solid progress across the company with our new product launches. The Paris Air Show was very successful for GE with $26 billion of wins. We are gaining share in healthcare with robust product launches and are expanding service offerings with new software launches in aviation, power and healthcare.","In the second half, revenue will be positively impacted by power and water shipment timing, specifically 70% of our gas turbines, wind turbines and distributed power products will be shipped in the second half. We have strong margin expansion with growth of 50 basis points. Every business grew in the quarter except for home and business solutions, and even in that segment appliances expanded while lighting lagged. And we are on-track for 70 basis points for the year. Key margin execution drivers are within our control. We will have one of the strongest value gaps in history as generate both price and material deflation. We will manage R&D to be flat for the year. We will reduce SG&A by at least $1 billion. We continue to execute multiple restructuring projects with attractive paybacks. And we are in the process of completing our projects for 2013 while developing a pipeline of new ideas.","The key driver for margin improvement in the second half is the power and water volume growth where we remain on-track. Overall margins were slightly better than we expected in second quarter and that gives us more confidence going forward. Our cash execution improved in the quarter. Our second quarter industrial CFOA was up 60% excluding the impact of NBCU related taxes. In the quarter we announced that GE Capital will pay up to $6.5 billion dividend to the parent for the year. And we remain on-track for our CFOA goals.","We have returned $9.9 billion to investors in the first half through dividends and buyback. This is well on our way to our $18 billion goal. Our announced deals of Lufkin and Avio will close in the second half. Both fit our model of (inaudible) that are accretive to earnings. We end the quarter with a consolidated cash position of $89 billion with $19 billion at the parent. This is a symbol of our financial strength and supports balanced capital allocation. And now over to Keith, as you know this will be his last call, but you will see him again at GE Capital and welcome to Jeff, my new partner. ","So, Keith, over to you.","Keith Sherin","Jeff, thanks. So I will start with the second quarter summary. We had continuing operations revenues of $35 billion, that was down 4% from last year. Industrial sales of $24.6 billion are down 2% driven by power and water as you can see on the right side. GE Capital revenues of $11 billion were down 3%, operating earnings of $3.7 billion were down 8%. Operating earnings per share of $0.36 were down 5%. As Jeff said, that includes actually $0.03 of restructuring which I will cover on the next page, including the capital restructuring. And we also no longer have the NBCU earnings which was $0.02 in 2012 in the second quarter.","Continuing EPS includes the impact of non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations which I will also cover in the next page. As Jeff covered, the CFOA was $3.7 billion, including a very strong performance in Q2 from the industrial CFOA, plus $1.9 billion of GE capital dividends back to the parent. For taxes, the GE rate of 17% for the quarter is below the 20% rate we previously communicated for the year. We had an audit resolution with the IRS in the quarter and because that\u2019s required to be recorded entirely in the quarter rather than spread over the year, it caused the rate to be lower in the quarter.","We might have other audit resolutions during the year and depending on the outcome we currently expect the rate of high teens to 20% for GE for the full year. The capital rate is down from our forecast because of larger benefits including the tax efficient foreign disposition transactions as well as the recapture of prior un-taxed losses of real estate. As we previously indicated, we do expect the GE Capital rate in the mid-single digits for the year but there could be some variability as GE Capital as well depending on IRS audit resolutions and the tax on other possible dispositions.","On the right side you can see the segment results. Total industrial segment profit was up 2%. Ex-Power & Water, our industrial businesses grew their segment profit by 12%. Power & Water was down in the second quarter. However, the results were a significant improvement over Q1. GE Capital earnings were down in the second quarter, in line with lower assets and we will cover all the segments in more detail over the next several pages. ","Before I get to the businesses, I will start with the other items page from Q2. At the top, in total, we had $0.03 of restructuring and other charges in the quarter; $0.02 related to industrial and that's in the corporate line of the industrial recording, and $0.01 was in GE Capital. We continue to reduce our cost structure by lowering our SG&A headcount. We're rationalization our footprint and this should be a nice tailwind for margins as we go into the second half. We also had a $0.01 charge in the quarter related to an impairment for an investment that we made in Brazil and that charge was also included in the corporate line.","We had two one-time benefits in the quarter. First, as I mentioned on the previous page, we had a favorable IRS settlement, which resulted in almost four points lower GE tax rate in Q2 and in total contributed $0.1 in industrial benefit. And second, in GE capital, we exited our fleet platform in Canada, which resulted in a $0.1 benefit in the quarter and the benefit from this transaction was mostly tax related and contributed to a lower GE capital tax rate.","For discontinued operations at the bottom of the page, we had 122 million after tax impact in the quarter. In WMC we recorded a $128 million of new pending claims, so that's down significantly over the run rates that we\u2019ve been seeing. And we added $47 million of reserves in the quarter, resulting in a total reserve balance of $787 million, covering both pending and future claims. On gray zone, we booked $76 million of additional reserves to reflect ongoing claims and we ended the quarter with $557 million in reserves.","On the bottom of the page is a summary of our operating EPS and our industrial gains and restructuring. In the first quarter, we reported $0.39 of operating EPS and that included $0.04 of net benefit as in Q1 NBCU gain was greater than our industrial restructuring. In Q2, we reported $0.36 and that included a $0.02 drag from industrial restructuring, again in the corporate line. And we expect to have at least $0.02 more of industrial restructuring in the second half. So for the total year, we don't expect the NBCU gain in restructuring to have an any impact on EPS.","So I\u2019ll move on to businesses and let me start with Power and Water. Orders of $6 billion were down 1% and Europe remained challenging, down 40%. Ex-Europe, orders were up 6%. Equipment orders of $3 billion were down 5%. Thermal orders remained soft at $690 million, down 50%. We had orders for 24 heavy duty gas turbines versus 30 last year. We had a strong renewables quarter with orders of $1.4 billion, up 55%. Distributed Power Orders of $700 million were up 3%. And Service Orders of $3 billion were up 2%. Again ex-Europe services orders were up 13% driven by the strong U.S power gen services, both outages and upgrades with orders up 29%. Overall for Power and Water, orders pricing was up 1.6%. ","Revenue of $5.7 billion was down 17% driven by lower volumes. Equipment revenue of $2.6 million was down 30%. We shipped 19 gas turbines versus 31 last year and we shipped 351 wind turbines versus 726 last year. Service revenue of $3.1 billion was down 3%. Power gen services revenue was down 1% total, but up 14% ex-Europe again, driven by the strength in the U.S. which was up 20%. Segment profit of $1.087 million was down 17%, driven by the lower volume. SG&A cost were down 9% in Q2, value gap was positive and margins increased by 10 basis points. ","So Q2 showed improvement over Q1 for Power & Water. If you look at the second half dynamics, as just said we've got a lot of volume and we expect Power & Water volume to be higher in the fourth quarter than third quarter. Renewables will continue to improve. Distributed power and services continue to improve and costs are going to continue to go lower. So our current outlook is to deliver the total year framework that Jeff covered on Power and Water and EPG.","On the right side is Oil and Gas. Results in the second quarter were very strong. Orders of $5 billion were up 24%. Equipment orders of $2.8 billion were up 42%. We saw double-digit growth across all the segments with turbo machinery up 74% driven by U.S. midstream LNG orders . Subsea was up 30%, driven by large projects in Indonesia and Angola. Service orders at $2.3 billion were up 8%. We saw a nice growth in global services up 14% and we are making significant progress in growing our sub-sea service business which was up 44%. This was partially offset by measurements and controls which was down 1%. ","While still down, this is up from the first quarter when M&C was down 13%, so some improvement in the market. Our backlog grew by $1.1 billion in the quarter to $18 billion and our orders pricing was up 80 basis points, our ninth quarter of positive order price increases. Revenue of $4 billion was up 9%, equipment revenue of $2 billion was up 11% driven by growth in subsea and drilling and surface. And service revenues of $2 billion were up 6% driven by stronger global spare parts sales.","Segment profit of $532 million was up 14% as the benefits of higher volume, positive price, and SG&A reductions more than offset higher program spending and drove 70 basis points of margin expansion. Our next is aviation. The aviation team had a strong quarter. Orders of $5.8 billion were up 4% with equipment orders of $3.2 billion up 7%. Commercial engine orders of $2.5 billion were up 81% driven by $1.4 billion of CFM orders including $670 million of LEAP orders. Military equipment orders of $300 million were down 72%, driven by no repeat of the Saudi F-110 order last year, which was $890 million.","Service orders of $2.6 billion were up 1%, commercial service orders of $2 billion were up 11%. The 2Q average daily spares order rate was $24.6 million, up 19%, as we continue to see a nice rebound from the higher year-to-date GE fleet utilization that\u2019s up 2.6% globally, and as airlines' shop visits and parts restocking return to more normal buying behaviors.","Military service orders were down 25% as we are seeing some impact from reduced flight hours and inventory management. Overall for aviation, order pricing was up 2.5%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 9% driven by equipment up 12%. We shipped 596 commercial engines in the quarter which was up 30 units or 5%. We shipped 33 GEnx units, up from 27 last year, and we shipped 280 military engines which were 21 units or 8%. Service revenues of $2.6 million were up 6% driven by commercial services up 12%, partially offset by military services which was down 6% on lower spare parts. Segment profit of $1,067 million was up 16%, driven by the strong value gap. Pricing up 3.6% and also by higher volume, and margin rates grew by 1.1 points in the quarter.","On the right side is healthcare. Orders of $4.8 billion were up 2%, equipment orders of $2.8 billion were up 4% and that's seven points better than we saw in the first quarter. Developed markets were up 3% with the U.S. up 5%, Europe was up 7%, Japan was down 26% but it's down 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Developing markets were up 8% driven by China up 16%, Latin America up 4%, India up 1%. If you go by modality, MR was up 14%, CT was down 6%, ultrasound was up 13%, life sciences was down 1% and diagnostic guidance systems was down 5%. Service orders of $2 billion were down 2%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was flat and again that's driven by the growth markets up 10%, offset by the developed markets down 4%. Segment profit of $726 million was up 5% as the benefits of restructuring and higher volume more than offset the impact of lower pricing and margin rates were up 80 basis points in the quarter.","Next is transportation. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 23%, equipment orders of $441 million were down 45%. So we continue to see the impact of soft North American locomotive and global mining equipment markets. Service orders of $633 million were up 7% driven by locomotive services. Orders pricing was up 40 basis points and revenues of $1.6 billion were up 2% as the growth in signaling and parts more than offset lower equipment revenues which were down 14%.","We shipped 170 locomotives in the quarter versus 243 last year. Segment profit of $313 million was up 11% driven by the positive value gap in services growth which also drove margins up 160 basis points. Energy management had a strong quarter versus last year. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 19% driven by digital energy up 24% and power conversion up 20%. We saw a strong growth in digital meters and in the marine segment in Brazil and China. Revenues of $2 billion were up 6% driven by power conversion up 7%, partially offset by lower revenues in digital energy.","Segment profit of $31 million was up from $4 million last year driven by the improved value gap, and segment margins were up 140 basis points. Home and business solutions had another positive quarter. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 5% as 8% growth in appliances was partially offset by a 4% decline in lighting sales, and segment profit of $83 million was up 5%. Appliances was up 31%, driven by positive pricing and lower program spending, partially offset by the results in lighting. Margins were flat for the quarter and we continue to see strength in the housing. Second quarter housing starts were up 18% boosted by single family up strong double-digits and multi-family starts of over 20%. ","So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Bornstein to cover GE Capital.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Thanks Keith. GE Capital revenue was just under 11 billion in the quarter, down 3% driven by lower assets, partly offset by high gains. Assets were down 7% or $37 billion year-over-year. Net income was $1.9 billion, down 9% from prior year, primarily driven by lower assets and higher gains were offset by losses margin impairments in the quarter. Tax benefits were essentially flat year-over-year with a rate down driven by lower pre- tax income on lower assets. We ended the quarter at $391 billion of ending net investment. That's down $40 billion from last year and down $11 billion sequentially. Our net interest margin was up 18 basis points versus 2012 to 5% and flat with the first quarter. Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel I basis improved to 11.2% in the quarter, driven by the reduction in investment in the balance sheet and after paying $1.9 billion in dividends in the quarter. ","On the right side of page, asset quality trends continue in the right direction, with delinquency rates improving across the portfolio. The only exception being the seasonality we expect in our UK mortgage business. In addition, non-earning assets totaled $6.6 billion. That's down $600 million from the first quarter and down $1.6 billion versus last year. CT ended the quarter with $36 billion, well on its way to the $35 billion plan for the year. And liquidity was very strong, ending the quarter at $70 billion.","Now I'll walk you through the segment performances. CLL, Commercial Lending and Leasing businesses ended the second quarter with $174 billion of assets. That's down 6% from last year, driven by a reduction of non-core assets of about $7 billion and $4 billion of lower core assets primarily driven by asset sales, including the fleet Canada disposition Keith referred to. On-book core volume was 6% higher than the second quarter of 2012. And new business returns remain attractive at about 2% returns on investment. ","Earnings were strong across all the regions and up 31% total driven by the fleet disposition, asset sales, higher tax benefits in Europe, partially offset by asset impairments. Asset quality continued improving, with delinquencies down 50 basis points versus last year and non-earning assets were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2012. In the consumer segment we ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 1%. Net income of $828 million was down 9%, primarily driven by the removal of reserve seasonality in our U.S retail business under the new modeling approach that we completed in the first quarter. We expect reserve coverage in the U.S. retail business to be above the same in the third quarter.","The U.S. retail business earned $563 million in the second quarter, down $78 million from last year, driven by the reserving change I just mentioned and partly offset with core growth. Asset growth in this business was strong at 9% and asset quality continues to set new benchmarks, with 30 day delinquency down to 3.85%. Our core Europe business earned $149 million in the quarter, which was essentially flat year-over-year. The real estate team continues to execute very well. Assets ended the quarter of $42 billion. That's down 28% year-over-year. Net income of $435 million was up two times versus 2012. And that was driven by higher gains on the equity portfolio on higher tax benefits. The business sold 180 properties with a book value of $1.9 billion for about $200 million in gains in the quarter. Asset quality continues to improve with 30 day delinquencies on the debt book at 2.1% and that's 6 basis points lower sequentially. ","The verticals, GECAS earned $304 million. That's down 1% with assets down 3%, driven by lower gains on aircrafts sales and modestly higher impairments on aircraft held for sale. Returns remained very attractive on new volume. EFS earnings were down driven by the impairment of a single-asset in our energy book and modestly lower gains across the portfolio. For our total results, we did have roughly $300 million of tax provisions in the GE Capital Corporate that partially offset the tax benefits in the segments to book to a total year expected rate of mid-single-digits. This along with a non-repeat of $200 million of tax benefits from BP, Business Properties transactions in the second quarter 2012, explains the higher corporate charge year-over-year.","So overall, GE Capital continues to perform well. Its results were in line with our strategy to reduce the size of the business. And as you look forward to the third quarter with the loss of earnings we're shrinking assets and adjusting for one-time items, the normalized run rate for GE Capital was still in the range of about 1.8 to 1.85 in earnings. ","So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Immelt","Great, Jeff, thanks. As for the framework, we have really no change to the 2013 operating framework. We're not planning for an improved environment for the balance of 2013 but execution levers are in our control, a solid backlog, good technology, strong cost control and disciplined capital allocation. In addition, we have a very diverse global footprint, which is well positioned for the macro tailwinds that are out there like in oil and gas. So again, as I said, no change for 2013 operating framework. We still plan on solid investment earnings growth for the year, driven by expanding margins. Our second quarter profile supports this growth. GE Capital will have solid growth for the year and we have no change in our framework for corporate costs for cash.","We still plan on double-digit EPS growth for the year. So, everything is consistent with what we said at EPG and we are well positioned to deliver for investors. And in conclusion, let me recap our status versus investor goals we set for the year. First our industrial earnings growth will improve during the year. Power & Water was a drag in the first half but should have positive earnings growth in the second half. The other segments are executing. So, we should see strong growth for total industrial in the second half. We plan to achieve 70 basis points of margin improvement for the year.","The second quarter exceeded our expectations and the teams did solid job on execution. We expect to receive up to $6.5 billion dividend from GE Capital this year. Organic growth will likely be at the low end of our 2% to 6% range for 2013. Again, the wind turbine cycle is a headwind, but we're well positioned for the future with a solid backlog and the balance of our industrial businesses should grow in line with our 5% to 10% organic growth goal. We're on track to return $18 billion to shareholders through dividends and buyback. So for GE this is a solid quarter and we're on track for a good year.","Now, I will turn it back to you and we will take some questions.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great, thanks Jeff, Keith and Jeff. So why don't we open up the lines and take some questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Davis representing Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Jeff, when you think about last quarter and the disappointing margins you put up, your confidence in the 70 basis points for the year seemed to be somewhat wavering and maybe it seems like your each call. I mean putting up the 50 basis points this quarter, does that indicate to you an increased confidence that you're going to see this back half of the year margin ramp particularly given what you saw on value gap?","Jeffrey Immelt","You know, Scott, it really does. Again, I think the teams have been executing well. I would decompose a little bit the way we talk about margins. The value gap is on track to be significantly positive this year. Our SG&A, our simplification efforts I think are just gaining momentum. So that looks good. R&D, I think levelizes for the year, mix levelizes for the year. And the power & water units are in backlog. So, Scott, I think as we execute that ramp, we feel pretty confident in the 70 basis points for the year. We still have a slight hedge in the numbers and I just think we're building momentum.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Make sense. And if I -- I know it's hard when you look at backlog and orders just given the timing to figure out exactly when the revenues are going to pull through, but when you really look at the order growth and the fact that you're getting, I mean you are down including wind but excluding wind up 5%, you said. But you say it in the slides not counting on environment, improving, but the order book does imply that the back half of the year is going to have some unit volume tailwind. Am I reading that correctly?","Jeffrey Immelt","Oh, yeah. It definitely does. Just given the way the wind -- Scott, like you know, just looking at the wind profile, if you look at power & water, it's going to strengthen in the second half. And the other businesses I'd say are already demonstrating some nice momentum. So things like aviation spares which were a drag last year have turned into a tailwind this year. Oil & Gas, I'd say four or five segments double-digit orders growth, even M&C I\u2019d say better quarter. So if you just take through one-by-one, you're going to get some gathering momentum I think in the second half of the year.","Scott Davis - Barclays Capital","And just a clarification, the loss in Brazil, I assume that's the EBX, Eike Batista, investment?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, that's right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","I have a couple of clarifications. So just want to confirm were there any gains that you would consider one time within the industrial segments that might have helped to the 50 basis points of margins this quarter?","Keith Sherin","We had a small disposition in aviation, but it was immaterial, John. In total across the industrial segments the impact of gains was zero.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And then the rise Keith or Jeff in the year-over-year corporate, you did call out the asset impairment of $0.01, but was there any industrial reclassification in the way you look at the businesses that might have again -- sorry to be nitpicky, but may have helped the margins and then in turn that flowed through the corporate line? Or why was the corporate up as much as it was?","Jeffrey Bornstein","There was no reclassification, but I can take you through corporate. If you look at the corporate second quarter number, it's a $1.883 billion. Remember you\u2019ve got to take out the non-operating pension which on a pre- tax basis is 661. So we're the $1.2 billion in the quarter. There is really three things. We have $280 million of pre- tax restructuring in corporate, which is the $0.02. And again that for the year will be against the NBCU gain. We have the impairment of $108 million in the corporate line. And then the third thing not really related to corporate, but it just flows in that line is that GE Capital preferred dividend of $135 million. So if you take the second quarter and you get to a run rate, you\u2019re basically at the run rate we need to be, about $3 billion for the year.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","That makes sense. Keith, can I ask you about WMC in Japan? We\u2019re still taking charges for it. And just remind us, if I'm not mistaken, wasn't there a statute of limitations in New York that prospectively makes the run rate on WMC hopefully or you tell me much lower going forward? And then maybe this is for Jeff, is there not an opportunity to pay off these Japan liabilities sometime early next year? I\u2019m just wondering what -- I realize it\u2019s still early, but Jeff what your thoughts are toward perhaps pursuing that kind of attack?","Jeffrey Immelt","I think I can start with both of those for you, John. On WMC, yes the statute limitations runs six years from the date of the securitization and we basically have completed all the securitizations that came out of WMC of going through that six year period now. And I think that's why you see a slowing of the additional pending claims. And so we need to resolve these. We're in negotiation and discussion on the claims and we're going to work away through as you go through the second half of the year and we'll continue to update you. From a Japan perspective, there is a contractual discussion point in the first quarter with Shinsei. And we will have a discussion with them and whether we can reach agreement or not remains to be seen, but there is an opening there in the first quarter that we'll be pursuing and negotiating with them.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague representing Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Just first just back on the question of gains, it netted out year-over-year in the quarter, but can you just put a finer point on what it actually was TransDigm and what other stuff you might have had?","Keith Sherin","The Aviation TransDigm benefit was immaterial in the segment. And I didn't say it netted out year-over-year. I said it was zero in the quarter in the segments.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","I thought you said net neutral year-over-year.","Keith Sherin","No, no. In the quarter the small benefit we got in TransDigm in Aviation, if you go to the segment profit level, it was zero across the segment profits for the industrial businesses.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And just shifting to power, so power price looked decent in the quarter. I just wonder if you could give us a little color around service price versus order price and what's driving that?","Keith Sherin","Sure. Power & water, if you look, the equipment pricing was up 3.5% in the quarter. Service pricing was down three-tenths and overall up 1.6%. Thermal and PGS was down 2.2%, renewables was very strong up 11%. Those will be the biggest drivers.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And then just a little more color, if you could, on just what's going on in service. Europe, obviously weak, it sounds like you got little less there maybe. How do you see that plan over the balance of the year?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, I think one bright spot in service is certainly in the U.S. If you look at the U.S. PGS, the orders were up 29%. In the first quarter we talked about some advanced gas path upgrades, the team did a pretty good job executing in the quarter. They had about 12 of them in the quarter and that's a good sign for us. In the U.S. service business revenues were up 20%. In Europe, the PGS had a really challenging quarter, down 59%, Jeff. The fleet operating hours, we had reduced outages, it's UK, Italy and Spain. So, we're seeing some positive benefits of fleet in the U.S. and we're more than offsetting the drag that we have from the fleet in Europe right now in the PGS business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker representing Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","First a quick clarification, again, on that corporate versus segment impact restructuring and other charges, that was $0.03. Was any of that in corporate or is it all in the segments?","Keith Sherin","No. If we go to the corporate line you adjust for the non-operating pension. Out of the $1.2 billion, there is $280 million of restructuring on a pre- tax basis, that's industrial. There is another penny that's in capital and corporate. So out of the $0.03, $0.02 is in industrial and $0.01 is in Capital.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","But that 281 is counted in the -- is part of that 183 right?","Keith Sherin","Yes, it is.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. So that was in corporate, okay.","Keith Sherin","Right. And so was the NBCU gain in the first quarter, and we said the restructuring will be in corporate through the year.","Jeffrey Immelt","Just to be [clear], because I want to make sure it really gets all right. On the NBCU gain...","Keith Sherin","Sure. So in the first quarter we had the NBCU gain. We made a set of decisions to lower our cost structure in the company. From an accounting perspective, you have to actually complete all the actions to book the accounting charge to reflect the downsizing that you're doing. And so not all that could happen in the first quarter. We have additional work to do to identify and complete the projects. So, we had $0.04 of restructuring in the first quarter against the NBCU gain and that left a net of positive $0.04 in that first quarter EPS. In the second quarter, we had a [negative] $0.02 after tax of industrial restructuring. And in the third quarter and the fourth quarter will probably have another penny at least each quarter. So, that for the year, Steve, basically it's a zero, it's in the corporate line. And the first quarter was a net positive and the second quarter is a net drag, and the third and fourth quarter will be a slight net drag.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay, great.","Keith Sherin","Does that help?","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Yeah, it does a lot, thanks. And then on the -- a little more clarification on the GE Capital side guys, since we have a lot of GE Capital horsepower there now. Just the CRE...","Keith Sherin","(Inaudible) also before, I think.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","No, no, no, it's always good, right. The commercial real estate gains, the $200 million you talked about, we continue to see an environment where you're getting these every quarter. I mean as you run down that book, what's your visibility to that going forward and how long and sustainable it is?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, so we did have 200 in the quarter, and the team has done a pretty good job as we have reduced that book down to about $17 billion of our investment, doing that as profitably as possible. It is going to get progressively more difficult to generate the same level of gains unless we continue to see improvement in the markets where we're selling these assets. So we've been very focused in the U.S., that's where the recovery has been the biggest, the fastest. We're seeing some signs of life in Europe, in Northern Europe and UK and France. But it's still a long way to go there and Japan is a little bit better. So, I think there still will be the opportunity to generate gains. Whether we will be able to generate as we move down the next $17 billion at the same rate, I think remains to be seen. I think that\u2019s going to be a little bit of a challenge.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then on the provisions side, they were at least a little lower than I was expecting. Can you maybe just comment on how you're thinking about the amount of provisions in the quarter?","Jeffrey Bornstein","I think provisions came in above where we thought they would be. They were up about $300 million year-over-year. $200 million of that was associated with our retail business in the U.S. And we went through that reserve model change that we completed in the first quarter. One of the outcome of that is we removed the seasonality that we historically have had in the second quarter. And so that didn't repeat year-over-year. And then we added $100 million of reserves in CLL, principally in our U.S. CLL business. So I think provisions came in just about where we expected them. They were down sequentially because we made that final change in the retail reserves in the first quarter, which was like $600 million. So that's why they sequentially look lower.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Berstein","And maybe to sneak one last in for Jeff. Energy management and intelligent platform, does that continue to be a targeted growth area both acquisitively and organically?","Jeffrey Immelt","It is organically, I would say, Steve. There has been commentary about transactions and even though we don't like to specifically talk about companies, I would say when you guys think about what we've outlined in terms of the priorities for the company, the one transaction that's been rumored really doesn't fit our stream as to the kinds of places we're going to put capital . So, is that the good way to answer your question Steve?","Steven Winoker - Sanford Berstein","Couldn\u2019t be more direct. Thanks Jeff. I'll pass it on.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of the Deane Dray, representing Citi Research. Please proceed.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Best wishes to Keith and to Jeff Bornstein in their new responsibilities. Jeff Bornstein, since you\u2019re on the hot seat now, how about just some color -- I know it was forgone conclusion that GE Capital would be declared a SIFI, but just as there -- are there any consequences regarding capital requirements reporting and so forth?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yeah, I don't -- we have been in preparation for this day for the better part of two or three years. We've had the Fed with us for the last two years. We have been running in parallel all of the processes you see in the major banks running, whether that's stress testing, preparing ourselves with a recovery plan and working early innings on a resolution plan. So I don't think incrementally it is anything that we won't be able to deal with. I think our capital is in very, very good shape. I think our processes are improving every day. So I don't think that the margin, that the designation is going to mean all that much to the business.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","And then for Jeff Immelt, at EPG there was a lot of focus about prospects for a staged exit of the business and how the proceeds would be used for buybacks and changing of GE's earnings mix. Can you give us any update as to where that process stands?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, I\u2019d say notionally, Deane, we\u2019re still on track for what I talked about at EPG. Again I don't think we're quite ready to talk detailed specifics. But you'll be hearing from us in due time, but the notion, the strategy that we outlined at EPG is still on track.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","First of all Jeff and Keith, congratulations on your new roles. Just wanted to go to back to the price cost benefit this quarter, the value gap of 293. How does that compare to the plan? And given that pricing and orders are improving, the backlog price is improving, raw material environment remains to be benign. How does that develop over the balance of the year?","Jeffrey Bornstein","You've seen our pricing and orders quarter-after-quarter, six quarters of positive OPI across the company. That's coming through in revenue. This quarter we had 1% positive price in sales. I think that continues. I think we've put it into the backlog and with the OPI strong on the new orders coming in, I think you're going to continue to see pricing. I think the change that we've seen year-over-year has been a big improvement in deflation. Last year at the half we had close to $60 million of inflation and this year we've got significant deflation. So, I think we expect that to continue. We do a lot to lock in our purchases on a forward buy basis. So we're feeling pretty good about the value gap, Jeff, talked about it. I think that's going to be, as we show on the margins chart, a significant contributor to us getting to the 70 basis points this year. And as you listen, as we go business-by-business, we talked about the value gap and just about every one of the segments been a positive contributor. So the teams have been focused on pricing. They're focused on delivering projects at the margins we quote or better, and the sourcing deflation has been positive for us this year.","Jeffrey Immelt","It's going to be -- this is going to be better than our plan, and I think that's where the source of our hedge is going to come from.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okays. So you think there is a point or more of margin benefit in the back half of the year from price inflation. And then, obviously the power and water margins were pretty incredible given the sharp decline in revenues, and you call that the price value gap obviously, and then mix. And I'm wondering, to the extent to which you benefited from some of these power upgrades on the gas turbines versus what you might characterize as regular MRO work on the [install].","Jeffrey Immelt","Well, it was a positive for us. I mean if you look at the service business it was actually up slightly on our profit. So the net benefit of everything they did whether it's the part sales or the upgrades and outages in the quarter, gave them a little lift. And so I think it's a positive we're up on our profit even with the revenue been down a little bit. So services versus equipment was a benefit certainly in the energy segment.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","And then a quick one on the GE Capital dividends. $1.9 billion in the quarter, $6.5 billion for the full year. How do you expect that to phase over the balance of the year?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, we have got that (inaudible) even there over the third quarter and fourth quarter. So $1.5 billion in third and $1.5 billion in the fourth is the assumption today.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Great, thanks a lot.","Keith Sherin","That\u2019s for the specials.","Jeffrey Immelt","(Inaudible). Yeah.","Keith Sherin","And then 30% of (inaudible).","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan representing Nomura. Please proceed.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","I just want to update on sort of gas turbine order expectations for the year. I think you've been talking about 120, 130, we're only at 32 here in the first half. Is that still the target and if it is, what are the things, sort of where do those orders come from?","Jeffrey Immelt","Shannon, my hunch is that the overall market is not going to be quite as strong as we had initially expected. So my hunch is that the order for the year will be between something like 100 and 115, in that range. And again, so they come in buckets. I'd say there is still a fair amount of activity in the Middle East, China and Asia aren't bad. We expect U.S. to be better this year than last year but at a small level. Europe pretty sluggish, Africa okay. But they tend to come in buckets. But my hunch is that's where the orders will come in.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","You mean you have pretty good visibility into those, are there some lumpy things kind of in the ways to get there?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, we do. I think we have a pretty formal process we go through on booking orders and stuff like that. So, we kind of see, what I would say is pretty good visibility there.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","And then just on these, in the U.S. on the advanced gas path upgrades, I know you had talked about, I think they got pushed out of 1Q and you're expecting them in 2Q. Was all of that kind of recognized in 2Q or is there more of this to come in the second half, how do those work?","Jeffrey Immelt","There's still more to come in the second half, and again it's always between when we book the order and the revenue but I think that we've got something like [50], Keith, for the year?","Keith Sherin","We have a goal of 50 for the year. We did 2 in the first quarter, 12 in the second and we've got 8 in the backlog and we've got a number that are working. So I think there is a lot of progress. What we talked about in the second quarter we had three of them that we were working, slipped in two of those actually booked in the second quarter in addition to another ten. So I think the team has made a lot of progress there. And their position probably for the first quarter of '14 outages as you look at where they go, so it will be in the second half, later in the second half of the year we think, Shannon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","I just had a question around the simplification on the cost cutting. You had sort of $474 million of cost cutting savings in Q2. It looks like there wasn't much back in Q1 at all. Back in Q1 you talked about the majority of the cost savings coming in the second half. So I just want to square where -- you\u2019ve got $500 million of savings already in the first half. You talked before about $1 billion or so. Is that $1 billion number for the year a lot higher now? Because I guess you should -- again for the Q1 you should be getting most of the cost saving benefit in the second half?","Jeffrey Bornstein","We had actually $200 million in the first quarter, Julian. So that's how you get to 468 or whatever at the half. We're targeting at least $1 billion and we have an intense focus in this company around simplification. There is a regular rhythm. Everybody's engaged. We\u2019re reducing P&L's. We\u2019re putting things in centers of excellence. And we're going to look at more restructuring projects as we go into the second half year here. If we have good returning projects we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate those.","Jeffrey Immelt","Good momentum. I\u2019d be disappointed if it wasn't above $1 billion and we\u2019ve got a good backlog of projects.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And then within the services overall, just total company the orders were much better in Q2 than Q1. You talked about revenues being obviously at the bottom end of the 2 to 6 range. Is that solely on equipment? How is your view on the services revenue outlook for the year changed, particularly given the big improvement in orders sequentially?","Jeffrey Immelt","The goal for services is still around 5% for the year and that's the focus we have on it. So I think the mix is still mainly equipment driven on the total revenue.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And then lastly just any color you could provide on Europe. You had mentioned right at the beginning that it felt like a better quarter. Obviously power is still bad, just what you're seeing generally from your customers there?","Keith Sherin","We had obviously a big improvement in Europe in the orders. Remember the first quarter is down 17. The second quarter we\u2019re up 2. And it was mixed. We talk about power being tough, but the positives for oil and gas was very strong. Oil and gas orders were up 37% in the quarter. A lot of those were up in the Nordic. We have a great position in oil and gas in the North Sea. Aviation was up 26%. It was a mix of both equipment orders as well as service orders. We've seen a rebound of services in the Europe poll. Services were up about 15% for aviation. And healthcare had a nice turnaround. The Power & Water was down, but some encouraging signs in some of the other industrial businesses here, overall 2 versus 17 is a significant improvement obviously for us.","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, just another nuance on Keith\u2019s. I\u2019d say the most short cycle business we have in Europe is healthcare. And they had the first positive orders I'd say in a couple of years probably, in three years. So that's a decent but I'd echo what Keith said earlier on the Power gen usage side, it's still pretty weak in Europe. But it just seems to have net-net and the GE world anyhow, stabilized in Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, representing Bank of America. Please proceed.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on rising interest rates impact to GECC. How should we think about the second half given the funding mechanism and when do you think we\u2019ll see impact, if any?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Andrew, I\u2019d say first of all we\u2019ve issued about $28 billion debt year-to-date in addition to $1 billion preferred we talked about. So $29 billion total against the total year plan of $30 billion to $35 billion. So, most of our borrowing in the year is done. Fortunately, we're able to get out a little ahead of what's happened to benchmark rates in the last couple of months. Long-term generally higher interest rates have historically been good for GE Capital as well as most banks. Margins tend to expand, spreads and to expand vis-\u00e0-vis benchmark rate. So I would say generally I think on a longer term trend basis, higher rates are better for the business. I think from a liability perspective we're in great shape. ","We run a match funded book. So our short term change in interest rates really shouldn't impact us much, because our variable assets are matched with variable debt and our fixed assets with fixed debt. So we should be in pretty good shape. ","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just a question on healthcare, just surprised how strong equipment orders were in North America in the quarter. And at the same point CMS released 2014 proposed Medicare hospital outpatient payment regulations and those seem pretty bleak. How should we think about, a, the positive surprise in healthcare this quarter, how sustainable it is and where do you think the business is going given where the regulations are going.","Jeffrey Immelt","I'd say, look, I think our product line is pretty good right now and our positioning is pretty good. We're not counting on the U.S. market in healthcare to be super robust. And look, I think on the outpatient side there has been pressure on reimbursements for a long time. So, we're pretty cognizant of where it goes there. But I would say the U.S. market feels like it's growing flattish to maybe up a couple of points and I don't see that changing that much.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, this quarter for you it's market share gain, you think?","Jeffrey Immelt","You never know until you see the NEMA data, but it seems like a better run rate for us this quarter and then we'll see when we get the market data. It's usually a lag of a couple of weeks. But I think -- and then outside U.S., the growth markets were up 10%, and that's a decent profile for the healthcare guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","The orders price in Power & Water was 1.5%, the industry seems like it's obviously in relatively tough shape. Can you just walk through what drove that?","Keith Sherin","Well, I went through some of the pieces, if you looked at it. For equipment, thermal was down 5.5 so that's more in line with what you're seeing in the softness in the thermal market. But the renewables was up 12%. So, I think those were the two biggest pieces. Distributed power is about flat.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","What's driving that renewables dynamic? And I guess just pricing generally, are you with obviously volumes down across your business, maybe Jeff you can, just from a macro perspective, but pricing holding in there. Is this -- you're kind of making a conscious choice to kind of walk away from some business? Does it really, kind of not matter what the price is? It's more about the level of activities that's out there and that's just more of a macro question I guess.","Keith Sherin","Well, in the wind business we've got tremendous new product introductions and we're delivering value to our customers. So I think that's the biggest piece of the thermal, rather renewable price index performance for us in 2013.","Jeffrey Immelt","Steve, it's really kind of product-by-product. I see our service pricing is still pretty good and that shows up in service margins. Your reference on the power-gen market, it's a tough market. So you're seeing pressure there. Aviation, the pricing has been really pretty good, same ways locomotives behind product performance. So it's kind of a mix business-by-business. But I think on the input cost side we're not seeing any inflation really and so we see a favorable trade, let's say, in the short-term between our ability to sustain decent pricing in our market versus incoming inflation.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. And then just one last question on the Power & Water services stuff. Clearly good news that some of these upgrades and service work is coming through. That's just kind of like the delayed reaction to the significant increase in gas utilization last year. And if that is the case, I mean is this something you have line of sight on into '14 or is this kind of a pent-up demand being released this year as they kind of switch back to coal perhaps, and then you've got a little bit of tougher comp next year. How do we think about that?","Jeffrey Immelt","My sense, Steve, is that the power gen service piece ought to be pretty stable between '13 and '14. We have got a decent backlog of these advanced gas paths. We do have some turnarounds next year that are going to be helpful. So I view this as the ability to kind of have stable growth in the power gen service side.","Keith Sherin","It's really good economics for the customer.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. We're developing additional new product upgrades for them that give them better efficiency in operating performance and we can demonstrate those economics, right. It's not really related to just whether they run a little more from a cost of gas perspective. It's really about over the long term what's the value of that asset for them.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","How many did you do last year?","Keith Sherin","This is a new product introduction. So there have upgrades through the periods, but this is a specific area.","Jeffrey Immelt","Most significant.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jason Filman representing UBS. Please proceed.","Jason Filman - UBS","At healthcare, you called you called out the translation impact of the Yen on the healthcare business in Japan. More broadly, have you seen any competitive implications of the move in the Yen either in healthcare, energy or any of the other businesses?","Jeffrey Immelt","We really haven't -- a lot of things we do in aviation, stuff like that are dollar trades anyhow, but we haven't seen the Japanese companies becoming more competitive if that\u2019s what you mean. One of the advantages we have is we also make things in Japan and have a supply chain in Japan. So we\u2019re naturally hedged as these things go on from a cost position standpoint.","Jason Filman - UBS","Also in healthcare, healthcare seems to be the segment where pricing has been the most stubborn and I certainly understand particularly in North America and Europe it\u2019s been a challenging market, but what do you see as needing to change before that improves? Is that something that\u2019s possible anytime in the near to medium term?","Jeffrey Immelt","It's just a historical thing. The healthcare business is a little bit on the electronics cost curve. Half of it is physics and half of it is electronics. And you have a fairly rapid new product standpoint. So healthcare grows at CM rate, even when we show --- the way we look at price, it shows some erosion, but that's usually offset by sourcing and by margin on new products that are replacing the old ones. So it\u2019s a unique character on our portfolio.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Schauenberg, do you have any additional remarks?","Trevor Schauenberg","Yes, I\u2019ll just wrap quickly. Thank you everyone for joining the call today. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We'll be distributing our quarterly supplemental data for GE Capital as we always do soon, today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Jason and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s webcast. I\u2019m joined by our Chairman and CEO, John Flannery; and our CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start I would like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com\/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","And now I will turn the call over to John Flannery.","John Flannery","Great, thanks, Matt. In my letter to shareholders I spoke of our path forward. We are taking what we learned in 2017, recommitting to the fundamentals, and dedicating 2018 to earning back your trust and delivering for you. Today is our first report card for 2018 and we see signs of progress. At a critical time I\u2019m extremely proud of the team\u2019s intense effort and execution focus during the first quarter.","Adjusted EPS up $0.16 was up 14%. Industrial had a strong quarter delivering $0.18, up 29%, with strong performances in Aviation, in Healthcare, in Renewables, in Transportation and higher cost out in Corporate. This is partly offset by lower Power, Oil & Gas and GE Capital earnings.","Free cash flow was about what we were expecting. It was a $1.7 billion use but, importantly, a $1.1 billion improvement over the first quarter of 2017. We continue to make progress on cash. The team is intensely focused and cash is front and center in every conversation. We see it in our results both in the fourth quarter of last year and in the first quarter. Power continues to be our biggest challenge. The team is making good progress on execution, but the market is challenging and, as we\u2019ve said before, this will be a multiyear fix. We are confident we will exceed our 2018 goal of $2 billion plus of structural cost out. We delivered $800 million in the first quarter, which helped increase the industrial margin rate 60 basis points.","We have been working for several years to resolve our WMC-related exposures. As we publicly disclosed, in December 2015, the DOJ started a FIRREA investigation. In the first quarter, we booked a related reserve for $1.5 billion for WMC. Last November we announced our intention to divest $20 billion of assets over the next one to two years. We are making progress on these dispositions. Industrial Solutions will close in the second quarter and Value-Based Care in the early third quarter.","In addition, we are in active discussions on multiple smaller Aviation platforms, Current & Lighting, Distributed Power and Transportation. We\u2019ve got a lot to execute on but the first quarter was a good start to executing on our 2018 plan. There is no change to our framework of $1 to $1.07 earnings per share and $67 billion of free cash flow. We expect earnings pressure in Power will be offset by better Aviation and better Healthcare earnings and lower corporate costs. Renewables, Transportation and Oil & Gas should be about as expected.","And now next on orders. First quarter orders totaled $27 billion, up 10% reported but flat organically. Equipment orders were down 1% and service orders were up 1% organically. Jamie will give you orders details by business. The decline in equipment orders was driven by Power, which was down 40%. We saw strength across the rest of the portfolio, particularly in Renewables, Aviation and Transportation. Services orders were strong in Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation but were mostly offset by softness in Power and Renewables.","The majority of our markets are quite strong, our franchises are robust and we see a lot of opportunity for growth. Some market highlights are on the right. With respect to Power, we came into the year expecting the overall market for new gas orders in 2018 to be 30 to 34 gigawatts. Based on what we are seeing in the market, this is trending to less than 30 gigawatts. I will give you more details on Power in a couple of pages. We see broad strength in Aviation. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 5.9% year-to-date with strong growth both domestically and internationally.","Air freight volumes grew 7.7%. Load factors posted record highs for February. In Healthcare we saw strength in emerging markets with HCS orders up 7%, Bioprocess orders were up 7% as well. The U.S. and Europe markets continue to see modest growth. In the first quarter we signed our first cell therapy FlexFactory order with Shanghai Cellular Biopharmaceutical Group. Although this is a small business for us today, cell therapy is an exciting area where we are investing for growth. Orders for cell therapy were up 78% in the first quarter. Our Renewables onshore business continues to see strong growth but there is price pressure across the industry.","Next I will go through revenue, margins and costs. Industrial segment revenues were $27.4 billion, up 9% reported and down 4% organic. The difference was driven mainly by the impact of the Baker Hughes acquisition. Aviation and Healthcare had a solid quarter, both up 6%. Power, Oil & Gas, Transportation and Renewables all had negative organic revenues and Jamie will take you through the businesses in more detail. Our Industrial margins were 10.2% in the quarter, up 60 basis points. Organically margins expanded 160 basis points. This is very solid performance given the lower revenues.","Aviation margins were 340 basis points up year-over-year on cost out and higher service revenue, offsetting the drag of 186 LEAP shipments in the quarter versus 77 last year. Transportation margins were up 520 basis points driven by lower costs and a higher mix of services. And reduction in our structural cost is a highlight. At the Industrial level cost out was $800 million. While comps will get tougher throughout the year, we expect to beat our $2 billion plus target for cost out. Power cost out was $350 million and we see upside to the $1 billion Power cost out target.","Now with respect to Power, I thought it would be helpful to give you some context on what we are seeing in the power market and the actions we are taking to drive execution. Our plan for the heavy-duty gas turbine market was built on 30 to 34 gigawatts of demand. We are seeing lower demand today driven by energy efficiency, renewables penetration and some delays in orders. Our equipment orders were down 24% in the fourth quarter and were down 40% in the first quarter.","Given what we are seeing, we believe the 2018 market is trending below 30 gigawatts and we think this is the type of market that we are going to be looking at in general for the next few years. So here is the plan that we are executing on. First, we continue to have leading technology, deep domain, digital solutions and broad and deep customer relationships. We continue to be viewed as a go to provider in our industry and we are fighting for every opportunity in the market.","On the cost side, in an industry that clearly has excess capacity, we are aggressively moving to right size our footprint and base cost. We took out $800 million of structural cost in 2017 and an additional $350 million in the first quarter. We are on track to exceed our $1 billion target for 2018 and headcount and sites are coming down. We are maximizing the economics of our installed base. Our installed base is a valuable asset. We have a third of the world\u2019s power generation. We have increased our visibility to transactional outages by more than double since last October and that\u2019s up to 86%, which should allow us to capture more of this important market.","We are driving out cost and addressing the quality issues we had last year. The team has introduced a new sales force compensation program specifically aimed at driving transactional services and margins. We have a new leadership team in our supply chain and they are reinvigorating the use of lean and Six Sigma to drive better execution. The H cycle time is down 20%. Ultimately our goal is to cut this another 50% or more. The team has put in controls that are driving more disciplined production plans and better timing of cash in our long-term service contracts. These measures will lead to lower inventory and better cash flow over time. And we are also exiting non-core assets as we simplify the business.","Russell has built out the leadership team. In the fourth quarter we announced new leaders in Services and Supply Chain. In the first quarter, we added Chuck Nugent to run our Gas Power Systems business. He has deep operational background in Aviation and Healthcare. We have made a lot of progress putting the right team in place. So we are planning for the market to continue to be challenging, but we are taking the right steps to adjust to this market and drive execution.","In the final analysis, it\u2019s important to step back and look at our total Power portfolio. We have the leading franchise in gas turbines, a strong position in wind, cutting-edge technology, digital expertise, grid and automation capability and a growing presence in storage with our GE Reservoir. There are short-term pressures but GE is on the field playing out the transformation in this industry.","And with that I will now turn it over to Jamie.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, John. Before I start with the consolidated results and, consistent with what we laid out in November, we\u2019ve made adjustments to our reporting metrics starting this quarter. First, on EPS we now report an adjusted EPS number which has total continuing operations, excluding industrial gains, restructuring and other and non-operating pension and benefit costs. And on cash we have moved to reporting free cash flow as opposed to CFOA. Both of these changes reflect our continuing effort to simplify our financial reporting and bring our metrics more in line with industry peers.","Also as you know, last Friday we filed an 8-K with restated financials for 2016 and 2017 to reflect a number of new accounting standards, the most significant being the new revenue accounting standard known as ASC 606. I will go through more detail on the transition and financial impacts later in the discussion, but all financial metrics and prior period comparisons in this presentation are now on the new basis. And it\u2019s important to note that this does not change anything related to our cash flows and has no impact on our 2018 earnings and free cash flow guidance.","On the consolidated results, first-quarter revenues were $28.7 billion, up 7% reported. Industrial revenues were $26.5 billion, up 9% reported with the Industrial segments also up 9% and organically down 4%. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was $0.16, up from $0.14 in the first quarter of 2017 and I will walk you through the Industrial and Capital components of that. The Industrial businesses comprise $0.18 of EPS, up 29% versus last year, driven by strength in Aviation, Healthcare and lower Corporate costs. And GE Capital contributed negative $0.02 driven largely by interest on excess debt and costs relating to calling $2 billion of long-term debt during the quarter. The benefits from calling this long-term debt will be accretive within the year.","Next I will move to continuing EPS which was $0.04 for the quarter and includes $0.12 of costs related to restructuring and other, non-operating pension and benefit cost and US tax reform adjustments in GE Capital. Net EPS was negative, $0.14. As John mentioned, we recorded a $1.5 billion reserve charge to discontinued operations related to the WMC DOJ FIRREA investigation. As we have disclosed in our SEC filings and previously discussed, we have been under investigation since late 2015 by the Department of Justice related to activity in our mortgage subsidiary from 2006 and 2007.","In March we had settlement discussions following the DOJ\u2019s assertion that WMC and GE Capital violated FIRREA. We recorded the reserve based on our discussions with the DOJ and a review of settlements by other banks. We do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity. The discussions are ongoing and we will update you on this one as we know more. Free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion for the quarter, in line with our expectations and an improvement of $1.1 billion versus the prior year. And I will walk through more details on our cash performance in the next couple of pages.","Next on taxes, the reported GE tax rate was 15% and the adjusted tax rate was 25%. For the year we still expect an adjusted tax rate in the mid to high teens. On the right side are the segment results. Industrial segment op profit was up 7% reported and up 4% organically, driven by strong double-digit growth in Aviation, Healthcare and Transportation, partly offset by declines in Power and Oil & Gas. When combined with the lower corporate cost John mentioned earlier, the Industrial op profit is up 15% reported and up 12% organically. I will cover the individual segment dynamics separately.","Next I will cover cash. Our total Industrial free cash flow was negative $2 billion in the quarter. This represents total GE including 100% of Baker Hughes free cash flow. Adjusted for the $300 million of pension plan funding this quarter, our Industrial free cash flow was negative $1.7 billion, up $1.1 billion versus the prior year. On the right you can see the drivers of our cash flow. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2 billion. Working capital usage was negative $1.4 billion for the quarter, driven by inventory buildup of $1.1 billion in Renewables and Aviation.","This was needed for equipment deliveries in the second half of the year. Contract assets were a cash usage of $400 million this quarter driven by cum catch adjustments on long-term service agreements of $200 million and revenue in excess of billings for another $200 million. And the other outflow of $900 million includes deferred taxes and timing items related to project cost disbursements. Finally, we spent $1 billion in CapEx to support our growth in business segments, primarily Aviation, Healthcare and Renewables, and that was slightly above what our run rate will be for the remainder of the year.","On the next page I will discuss the cash balance walk for the quarter focusing on the GE ex-Baker Hughes column. Cash on hand ended at $7.5 billion, down $4.3 billion versus year end. In addition to the free cash flow impact which I had already discussed, our quarterly dividend was an outflow of $1 billion.","Next we received $300 million of proceeds from the Baker Hughes GE share buyback and also reduced our debt by $100 million, which is net of $300 million of incremental debt to fund the pension plan. Additionally, during the quarter we had investing activity related to our Aviation business, including an incremental share in Arcam for $200 million. Finally the $900 million change in Other is comprised of the pension contribution and other timing items during the quarter. There is no change to our 2018 guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow. We expect to end the year with $15 billion in cash, which is driven by the next three quarters of free cash flow, and disposition proceeds while funding the pension and the dividend.","From a liquidity standpoint, in addition to the cash on hand, we have roughly $20 billion of operating lines and an additional $17 billion of backup credit lines. Finally, GE Capital ended the quarter with $22 billion of liquidity. Overall we are continuing to focus and make progress on our four key financial priorities, which are: strengthening our cash position and delevering; reducing our costs; driving a cash and returns focus; and finally, to simplify and drive more transparency. Before I cover the segments I will go through a walk of EPS on the items we have discussed with the quarter since we are using new metrics.","Starting with our net EPS of negative $0.14, there is a negative $0.18 of discontinued operations which is mostly made up of the WMC charge for $0.17. Now walking from the continuing operations of $0.04, first we had non-operating benefit cost of $0.06 in the quarter. Additionally, on Industrial restructuring and other items we incurred $0.05 of charges, $0.03 of that was related to GE excluding Oil & Gas and was primarily driven by the cost-reduction actions we are taking at Corporate, Power and Renewables. And we incurred an additional $0.02 related to our Oil & Gas segment which represents our portion of Baker Hughes GE\u2019s restructuring, most of which was synergy related. Finally, in GE Capital we incurred a $0.01 true-up adjustment related to the updates to the U.S. tax reform enactment impact on energy investments.","Next, as you know, we issued an 8-K last Friday regarding the adoption of several new accounting standards. I will walk you through two pages on that. The first page provides an overview of the standards and their application within our segment. The most significant change was driven by the new revenue accounting standard, which resulted in differences in the timing of revenue recognition versus previous accounting guidance. For GE the main drivers of the timing differences were long-term services agreements and Aviation engine accounting.","On LTSA, their long-term services agreements, changes were made related to the accounting for contract changes and changes in scope and term. For Aviation engines we previously recorded revenue using levelized margins for a contract. And under the new standard, engine accounting reflects the revenue and cost for each individual engine, the most significant effect of this change is on our new engine launches like LEAP. Lastly, one additional change from the new 606 standard is the required reporting of remaining performance obligations, or RPO, going forward. RPO represents backlog, excluding any contract or purchase order that can be terminated by a customer without substantial penalty regardless of the probability of cancellation. Our RPO as of the end of the first quarter was $253 billion compared to backlog of $372 billion.","We have included a reconciliation of RPO to backlog in the supplemental information provided today. There are a few differences between RPO and backlog for us mostly driven by our Aviation business. First, backlog includes engine contracts for which we have received purchase orders that are cancelable. We have included these in our backlog historically as our historical experience has shown no net cancellations as any canceled engines are typically moved by the airframer to other program customers. Second, our services backlog includes contracts that are cancelable without substantial penalty, primarily time and materials contracts.","And lastly, backlog includes engines contracted under long-term service agreements even if the engines have not yet been put into service. We believe that backlog provides important information to investors and have included the reconciliation I referenced earlier to RPO in the supplemental information.","On the next page you can see the financial impact associated with the accounting updates on the left side. I will cover just the impacts of the revenue change, but you can see the total impact in the far right column inclusive of the other accounting changes. In total, the other changes impacted EPS by $0.01. For the revenue change, we recorded a cumulative retained earnings adjustment of negative $8.1 billion, which includes the opening retained earnings impact of $4.2 billion plus earnings impacts in 2016 and 2017.","Additionally, we recorded a $1.1 billion charge to retained earnings for the resulting U.S. tax reform impact. The standard reduced 2017 revenue by $2.2 billion and Industrial segment profit by $2.5 billion. GAAP EPS was revised down $0.30 of which $0.17 related to the new standard and $0.13 related to the tax reform impact. Adjusted EPS post all of the accounting changes was $1 in 2017. As a reminder, our 2018 guidance incorporated the impact of the new revenue accounting standard.","On the right-hand side of the page you can see the 2017 impacts to the segment. I won\u2019t go through them individually, but you can see the impacts to both revenue and op profit by business with the most significant changes in Power, Renewables and Aviation. The adjustments to Power were driven by changes in scope, term and the treatment of contract changes for LTSAs. And in Aviation it was driven by both LTSAs and engine accounting and Renewables was also impacted by the timing of revenue recognition for International Onshore Wind. The new standard accelerated revenue so that it is recognized now on delivery versus before at installation and commissioning.","Now I will take you through the first quarter results by segment. As John discussed earlier, our current view of the market for Power, based on demand and expected contract closure timing, is trending below 30 gigawatts for 2018. And our first-quarter orders are consistent with that view. This quarter our Power orders were $5.6 billion, down 29% with equipment down 40% and services down 19%. In equipment, gas power systems orders were down 52%. Excluding Distributed Power reciprocating engines, GPS orders were down 71% on lower gas turbines, aero derivatives and steam units. We received no orders for H units, which was in line with our plan. Steam Power System orders were down 80% as a result of the non-repeat of two large orders in India last year.","Turning to services, our orders were down 19%, but down 12% ex-Water. Our contractual services orders were down 14% principally on lower AGPs and fewer replacement parts needed during outages as a result of the recent upgrade cycle. Utilization of the CSA fleet continues to perform as expected. Transactional orders were down 20% on lower AGPs and outages and in total we received four AGP orders versus 20 for last year.","Revenues in the quarter were $7.2 billion, down 9%. Equipment revenues were down 16% on lower gas turbines, heat recovery steam generators and aero derivative units. Service revenues of $3.7 billion were down 2% and up 8% ex-Water. Contractual Services revenue was down 18% on lower AGPs and a mix of content and outages this quarter. Transactional Services were up double-digits on higher outages and field service repairs and total AGPs in the quarter were 6 versus 21 last year.","Op profit of $273 million was down 38% principally on lower equipment volume, unfavorable price, lower AGPs and the absence of Water. This was partially offset by structural cost out of $354 million, down 17% and ahead of plan. As John discussed earlier, we are making progress on taking cost out, repositioning our services business and fixing execution issues. We are aggressively implementing additional actions; however, the pace of the market decline is greater than the near-term benefit of those actions. As a result, we expect business operating performance to be about flat to 2017, lower than we outlined at our November investor meeting.","Next on Aviation the market continues to be strong. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew by 5.9% through February year-to-date with solid growth in domestic and international markets and air freight volumes also had a strong start to 2018 growing at 7.7% through February. Industry load factors posted a record high in February at 80.4%. Orders in the quarter of $8.1 billion were up 13%. Equipment orders grew 18% on higher commercial engine orders, up 39%, driven by GEnx and LEAP.","Military engine orders were up 87% on large helicopter and F-110 contracts. Services orders grew 10% with commercial services up 5% on a higher spares rate of $25.2 million a day, up 16%. Military service orders grew 17%. Revenues in the quarter grew 7% to $7.1 billion. Equipment revenue was down 2% on fewer legacy engine shipments partially offset by higher LEAP shipments. We shipped 186 LEAP engines versus 77 a year ago. This is roughly 70 engines behind our original plan for the quarter. Military equipment revenues were up 22%. Services revenues grew 12%.","Operating profit of $1.6 billion was up 26% driven primarily by higher pricing on commercial engines and aftermarket material, as well as product cost productivity, which is partly offset by negative mix from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margins expanded 340 basis points in the quarter and 80 basis points of that was driven by the lower LEAP shipments. Aviation had a strong start to the year, outperforming in the quarter relative to expectations. This was driven principally by better spares performance, cost execution and favorable engine mix. We expect these trends to continue.","And on LEAP, as I mentioned, Aviation delivered 186 engines with improving cost position. LEAP product performance continues to be excellent. We are making good progress on our commitment to recover on LEAP deliveries by the end of third quarter and are on track to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 engines in 2018.","Moving to the top right on Renewable Energy, orders of $2.4 billion were up 15% over last year. Onshore Wind orders were $2.1 billion, up 16% on higher equipment, which was up 24%, partially offset by services down 21% on timing of U.S. repower orders. Wind turbine unit orders totaled 936 on higher U.S. volume while international orders declined 46%. Pricing on new units continues to be difficult and was down 13% in the quarter versus last year. Hydro orders of $199 million were down 26% mostly based on the timing of the orders profile.","Sales of $1.6 billion were down 7% on lower onshore unit shipments of 352 versus 539 last year. Higher services volume and hydro were up 25% and partially offset the lower shipments. Operating profit of $77 million was up 10% driven by the acquisition of LM. On an organic basis op profit was down 3% on unfavorable pricing and negative leverage on the lower onshore equipment volume. This was partially offset by better structural and product cost out. The onshore market continues to have pricing headwinds with wind turbines but we are making good progress on cost out. Product demand for Renewables remains strong with onshore megawatts and unit order growth expected to be up high single-digits to double-digits for the year and the business remains on track.","Now on to Healthcare. Orders of $4.7 billion were up 4% versus last year and up 1% organically. Geographically organic orders were down 1% in the U.S. and 2% in Europe. Emerging market organic orders were up 7%. On a product line basis Healthcare Systems orders were up 4% reported and were flat organically. Life Sciences orders grew 9% reported and 5% on an organic basis. Healthcare revenues of $4.7 billion grew 9% reported and 6% organically with Healthcare Systems up 6% and Life Sciences up 7%, both on an organic basis.","Operating profit of $735 million was up 11% driven by continued volume growth in productivity, partially offset by pricing and higher program investment. Margins expanded 70 basis points organically in the quarter. Also, as you saw, we announced the disposition of our Value-Based Care solutions division in Healthcare Digital to Veritas for over $1 billion of cash. This is part of the planned $20 billion of Industrial dispositions we discussed. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter. We feel confident in the Healthcare markets going forward; relative softness in the U.S. market in the quarter was driven by timing and tough comparisons. We feel good about the ability of the Healthcare team to outperform for the year.","On the next page I will start with Oil & Gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45 and Lorenzo and his team will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:30. Similar to prior quarters I will provide a comparison to the combined business based on financials as if the merger had taken place on 1\/1 of 2016. For reference I will give you the total orders and revenue comparisons of our legacy Oil & Gas business. Orders were $5.2 billion, up 102% reported and up 2% excluding BHI. On a combined business basis orders were up 9%. This was driven by growth in all product segments with equipment up 9% and services up 8%. Market fundamentals are supportive of growth as crude oil prices have remained relatively range bound, providing stability for customers to more effectively evaluate projects.","The gas markets continue to grow and LNG demand is strong. Revenues were $5.4 billion, up 74% reported and down 8% excluding BHI. On a combined business basis revenues were up 1%. Short cycle oilfield services and digital solutions revenues were up 12% and 4% respectively while the longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery and process solutions were down 7% and 11% respectively. Operating profit was $181 million, down 30% reported and down about 77% in our legacy Oil & Gas business driven by declines in our longer cycle oilfield equipment and turbomachinery businesses partially offset by synergies.","During the quarter, cash distributions from Baker Hughes GE totaled $440 million including the share repurchases and the quarterly dividend of $127 million. Lorenzo and Brian will provide more details on their call today. The team is executing well with $144 million of integration synergies in the quarter, on track for $700 million for the year.","Next is Transportation. North American carload volume was up 2.4% in the quarter primarily driven by Intermodal carloads up 5.6% and commodity carloads down 0.7%. Parked locomotives showed signs of improvement but remain at historically high levels. Orders of $1.5 billion were up 46%. Equipment orders were up 34% and we received orders for 342 locomotives compared to 37 in first quarter of 2017.","Additionally, we continue to see strong growth in mining with wheel unit orders up 30%. Services orders were up 58% on strong locomotive parts and mods growth. Revenues of $872 million were down 11% with equipment revenues down 47% on lower locomotive volume. This was partially offset by higher mining revenue up 148%. Services revenues were up 26% driven by aftermarket parts growth and mod shipments. Op profit of $130 million was up 37% driven by services growth and mining wheel shipments more than offsetting the effects of locomotive volume decline.","Overall Transportation delivered a strong quarter. Although carload volumes have improved and we\u2019ve seen a decrease in the number of parked locomotives, the market for new locomotives is still slow. The mining markets continue to recover with six consecutive quarters of orders growth. The Transportation team is done a great job of balancing operational execution while also making significant progress on positioning the business for disposition.","Moving over to Lighting, revenues for Current & Lighting were down 1% with Current down 7% and the legacy Lighting business up 5%. Operating profit was $1 million, down from $10 million last year. In the first quarter we announced an agreement to sell our Europe, Middle East, Africa and Turkey and global automotive lighting businesses. These businesses represented approximately $200 million of Current & Lighting\u2019s annual revenue of $2 billion. We expect to close substantially all of this deal in the second quarter and to sell the remainder of Current & Lighting by the end of 2018.","Finally I will cover GE Capital. Continuing operations generated a loss of $215 million in the quarter, down $168 million from prior year. This decline includes a $45 million loss related to updates to the U.S. tax reform impact on energy investments and a $50 million charge associated with upfront costs from calling approximately $2 billion of excess debt.","This ALM action will be accretive within the year. In addition, the business recorded lower gains and tax benefits that were partially offset by lower corporate and restructuring costs. We expect to have higher income and gains in the second half of the year driven by lower excess debt costs, tax planning benefits and asset sale gains related to our strategic plan we announced last quarter. Discontinued operations generated a loss of $1.6 billion, primarily driven by the WMC DOJ FIRREA reserve, and $53 million of trailing costs related to the GE Capital exit plan.","GE Capital ended the quarter with $146 billion of assets including $22 billion of cash and short-term investments. We paid down $9 billion of debt during the quarter, which is in line with our overall capital allocation framework. As I mentioned earlier, GE Capital has sufficient liquidity to manage the WMC FIRREA settlement. We are continuing to execute on our plan to improve the capital position and remain committed to meeting target capital levels by the end of 2019. We continue to explore incremental asset sale opportunities within GE Capital and will monitor and evaluate levels of capital based on the timing of asset sales and the potential WMC settlement.","With that, I will turn it back over to John.","John Flannery","Okay, thanks, Jamie. There is no change to our 2018 outlook for Industrial EPS or free cash flow. Given pressure in Power we see EPS closer to the lower end of the range. As I said earlier, we expect earnings pressure in Power will be offset by better Aviation and Healthcare earnings and lower Corporate costs. Renewables, Transportation and Oil & Gas should be about as expected. Cost out was $800 million in the quarter, on track to be better than $2 billion. Cost out in Power in the quarter was $350 million. Corporate was down $176 million and we are executing on synergies in BHGE.","As Jamie mentioned, GE Capital earnings will be breakeven for the total year due to our portfolio actions and we expect the second half of the year to be better than the first half. We are targeting free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion. At $1 billion better than last year\u2019s first quarter our first quarter is on track and no change to the outlook for the year.","I thought I would wrap with an update on the actions we are taking to run the Company better and an update on the portfolio. We are in the middle of our three-year strategic planning process and we have enhanced our approach this year. Much more detailed analysis on the markets, on our outlook, and a very detailed three-year financial plan for our businesses. We will be reporting out a summary of that to our Board in the second quarter.","We have our shareholder meeting next Wednesday and a Board meeting on Tuesday and we are very excited to have Tom Horton, Leslie Seidman and Larry Culp on board. They have been attending meetings since their announcement and are getting up to speed quickly and are fully engaged.","As I shared with you earlier, we are beginning to see some green shoots in Power on the execution front. I\u2019ve talked in the past also about our new compensation system which better aligns management with investors, less cash, more stock compensation and two metrics cash and EPS. We rolled out the new plan to the top 4,000 employees in the Company and your management team is aligned and everyone knows the definition of success.","Last year, given the urgency and severity of our challenges, we launched directly and with brute force into cost-cutting mode and improving our cash controls during the second half of the year. You can see the impact of this in the results of our past two quarters. I always had in my mind that there would be a second phase where it could be more deliberate about a new way to run the Company.","In that context I asked a group of our top leaders to spend a week at Crotonville working on developing a new GE operating system. They studied the world\u2019s best business system models. We asked six outstanding external leaders in their industries to meet with the team to share their best practices. I\u2019m excited about the path we are on. We are taking a new approach on how we run the Company. Our business units will be the center of gravity. HQ will be substantially smaller and will focus only on strategy, governance, capital allocation and talent. We will continue to leverage our horizontal capability across the Company.","I will personally lead the development and implementation of a new GE operating system that will be based on lean, Six Sigma and agile. We will drive and measure continuous improvement, operating performance and customer experience. We are also reinstating rigorous talent management and development with a focus both on values and performance to ensure the strong differentiation and organization vitality.","We expect this GE operating system will be applied within the Tier 1 business levels as well. And we are confident this is going to yield incremental cost savings above our current forecasts while creating a simpler, leaner high-performance Company.","As I said in my opening with respect to the portfolio, we are making progress on the $20 billion of dispositions we are targeting for 2018 and 2019. Industrial Solutions is on track to close in the quarter. Cash proceeds will be $1.9 billion. We announced the sale of Value-Based Care last quarter and we expect it to close early third quarter. Cash proceeds there will be $1 billion.","The divestment process on Transportation is progressing and we expect to have more to report in the second quarter. Earlier this year we laid out a framework to shrink GE Capital assets by $15 billion over the next two years. Assets were down in the quarter by $2 billion including a small portfolio sale.","Finally, and importantly, as I shared with you in January, we continue to review and evolve our thought process regarding the best structure or structures for the Company. Our guiding principle is to ensure that our businesses have the right operating rigor, management alignment and the organic and inorganic flexibility to maximize their potential and their value for our customers, our employees and our investors.","The Board, including our three new directors, is heavily engaged in this process. We have done and are continuing to do a significant amount of work looking at the best way to achieve our objectives in pursuit of our guiding principles. Consistent with what we said earlier this year, we expect to have something more to share with you on that within the next couple of months.","And with that, Matt, I will turn it back over to you.","Matt Cribbins","Thanks, John. With that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, good morning.","John Flannery","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Maybe just a first question around the Power business. Some sense I guess as to how much below your prior plan you think this year will shake out on the profit side. And also I guess related to that, what you are thinking about the cash conversion ratio. And if I look at the numbers, obviously profits are down a lot in Q1, but at least it was a fairly normal decremental margin, unlike the second half. So does that tell us that a lot of those excess costs you\u2019d booked in the second half, you think you are through that process now with cleanup?","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Julian. This is Jamie. Hey, I will take that one and then maybe John can get some color, sort of the broader Power market and what we see operationally. So first with respect to what we see in 2018, and maybe I\u2019ll talk about this a little bit versus last year and a little bit versus the prior guide. As I mentioned earlier on the call, we see 2018 as probably flat to 2017 or flat to prior year. You see the market shifting that we see, so we saw 30 to 35 gigawatts really shifting to maybe less than 30 as we look at the year.","So honestly as you look at, whether it is versus prior guide or versus 2017, this is really mostly a market story. Our prior guide had 60 to 70 gas turbine units. Our new guide would be 50 to 55. And on the aero side we had 30 to 40 before and now 20 to 30. And really the impact is just supply chain overhead, as you don\u2019t have those units come through you just see more liquidation impact. The second piece on cash, Power cash I would tell you for the first quarter was below plan, but that is not unusual for us in that business.","First quarter is seasonally low \u2013 a strong second-half unit shipment and unit profile order \u2013 profile for things. And then from a market perspective, as we talk about the market what you really see there is progress burn not being replaced as quickly by progress coming in from new orders. So, Power for this year continues to look like a real second-half profile story both with respect to the gas power business but really also with respect to how we see the trending in services.","John Flannery","And Julian, I would just add just a few sort of macro thoughts about how we are looking at Power right now, and kind of sequentially go through the market, our market share, our cost structure, what we are doing in the service business. I think, as you have all seen, the market and our market share is lumpy by quarter. But I think we do see enough trends, looking at our pipeline over 12 to 18 months, that we think this is going to trend softer than the 30 to 34 by a bit.","And I think the factors are well known. Part of it is Renewables penetration. Part of it also is the pricing of renewables keeps moving and we see utility customers in a bit of a wait-and-see mode to see how that pricing evolves over the next year. And then with energy efficiency, on the consumer side of things we are seeing more people comfortable with maybe lower surplus reserves and being able to delay some of their CapEx decisions.","So our market share, again, moves around by quarter, but we had about a 50% share last year and that ranged all over the place, about a 40 point swing in various quarters around a mean of 50%. We expect to be in that 45%, 50% basis on a rolling four quarters going forward. Our commercial teams I would say \u2013 we continue to be very disciplined on our approach to the risk and return of what we are seeing in the market. And that really leads you to a lower revenue outlook and obviously lower cost plan.","So we have announced the 12,000 jobs out, $350 million cost out in the quarter. We\u2019ll exceed the $1 billion target for 2018. And we are taking cost out at a much faster rate than the revenues are coming down but there\u2019s still an overall pressure there. And then on service, we see a lot off chance and opportunity here to improve the service business. So our contractual business is relatively stable and more stable. Where we have really been hurt in the last 12 months has been in our transactional business.","That\u2019s about 40% of the business in services. And we have taken big leadership changes there and also put in some very specific plans around increasing our visibility and making sure we are close to customers, see outages. That is more than double right now. We have got very specific sales incentive plans around driving revenue in that space and margin in that space.","And then a lot of changes we can make on our cash conversion, to your point. So new supply chain leaders managing cycle time, managing our payment terms, billing accuracy, et cetera. So \u2013 collecting past dues, we collected about $500 million of past dues in the first two weeks of April.","So we think there is a lot of improvement we can make in the business, but it\u2019s operating in a tough environment overall. And then the last thing I would say at a Company level is really looking at our energy portfolio in the aggregate. So obviously the gas turbine business has certain pressures based on what\u2019s going on in the industry. Those same factors pop up in a different way in our Renewable business, in our grid and grid software business, in the opportunity for storage. I think at a Company level we look at a holistic mix of what we have there.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","John Flannery","Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Steve Tusa","When we think about the guidance, so you took down the Power guide, I think you said Healthcare maybe could outperform a little bit. You didn\u2019t talk about the Aviation guidance. And just the way I am looking at this is basically the LEAPs will obviously ramp very hard in the second half and the 56s probably start to come down a bit. So your standing guide is $6.2 billion I believe to $6.3 billion on segment profit there. Any update to that number?","Jamie Miller","Yes, so on Power, I talked about it being flat to 2017. When you think about the rest of 2018 for the other businesses, we see very solid outlook for Aviation and real strength there. Healthcare is also really looking very solid for 2018 and we see upside there as well. And then the other piece that\u2019s coming through in a really strong way is cost out. And you saw that in the corporate numbers, but we are really seeing that across the board across the businesses in terms of just better cost productivity. Drilling in on aviation just a little bit, I mean obviously the market feels really good. Demand outpacing capacity, and you see that both in commercial and in military.","On the operations side we had less LEAP than we expected, but I will tell you, our spares rate was very favorable in the business. And I think that mix story and the cost management story \u2013 we see that really continuing throughout the year. Just to touch on LEAP, because I am sure that will be a question at some point, we are about 70 units behind as we hit the end of the first quarter. But as we look to the year we have got a very deep line of sight.","The team is really, really focused on it into supply chain and exactly what we need to do, what our suppliers need to do to really move LEAP execution. And right now we are tracking to be back on track by the end of third quarter and be in line for that 1,100 to 1,200 unit shipment story. So really I think on the Aviation side it feels very solid.","John Flannery","Steve, I would just add on the cost side of things, Jamie gave you a good sense as to how strong the outlook is for the business segments in Aviation and Healthcare. But on the cost side of things we just continue to see a lot of opportunity there. So you are starting to see that in our numbers. Russell and the team working it very hard in the Power business; Lorenzo and the team getting the synergies that we need in BHGE. And we still see big opportunities in really the overhead structures of the Company overall. And as I mentioned in earlier remarks about the operating system and really a philosophical sort of shift to pushing the management structures into the businesses, we think there is still more opportunity on cost as we go forward here.","Operator","Next we have Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you, good morning, everyone.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Jeffrey Sprague","Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask a couple of questions on the balance sheet actually, just trying to sort a couple things out. The receivable from capital to the parent declined about $4 billion in the quarter. If you could give us any color on what was going on there. And also I see goodwill and intangibles went up in Industrial about $1.5 billion sequentially. Maybe coincidently, but that kind of seems to erase the $1.5 billion equity hit at capital on the reserve. Maybe just a little color on what\u2019s going on in those two pieces.","Jamie Miller","Yes, the goodwill piece of it was really FX. And so, there really weren\u2019t any other changes. There were a few minor purchase price adjustments, but the goodwill shift was largely just the FX mark on the balance sheet. And in terms of the receivables from GE Capital, that\u2019s really just net maturities of debt.","Operator","Thank you. Next we have Steven Winoker from UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning, all. Just a couple of questions here. First, if I could, on the GE Capital kind of cash walk, cash availability given the $22 billion that you are starting with now. And maybe talk through how you\u2019re thinking about, Jamie, that in terms of asset sales offsetting debt maturities and insurance contributions, kind of what you have left.","And then secondly, John, I assume it\u2019s no accident that you are talking about the GE operating system here and you\u2019ve got Larry joining your Board soon. And there\u2019s a lot on that external best practice front to sort of think about in terms of opportunity. Have you sized that opportunity at all and paced it? And is that also what should give us confidence around hitting the EPS walk this year? And sorry about all the questions but I know I might get cut off after this. Thanks.","Jamie Miller","Hey, good morning. So I will take the GE Capital question here on just how we see liquidity and the asset sales there. So, GE Capital ended the quarter with $22 billion of cash and short-term investments. And we expect to maintain about $15 billion to $20 billion of liquidity through 2018 and 2019 in GE Capital. The asset sales that we talked about in January are well underway. We are seeing a really strong interest in the assets and we have got engagement with multiple parties right now.","In March we sold the first tranche of our tax equity portfolio and I think it was a really good template to use for future asset sales. But we see those coming in nicely throughout the balance of 2018 and our outlook right now is that our liquidity profile at Capital should nicely match kind of how we see the needs there in terms of debt maturities and the other flows. John, do you want to talk about the other?","John Flannery","Yes, let me pick up on that. And Steve, I would just say a few things for context. This idea in general is really something that I\u2019ve been experiencing and thinking about frankly for years. If you look back in the last three roles that I really had in the Company going back to \u2013 going to India in 2009. I had a sense in that role of frankly how difficult it could be to try to get things done far away from the center of the Company, if you will, and how much concentration there was of decision-making in the center of the Company.","Then went to the BD role and had a sense of how we are allocating capital around the Company and between the units. And then in the Healthcare business another perspective of running a business unit. So those three things really formed a thought in my mind that we needed to decentralize the basic management of the Company and push the responsibility out to the regions, out to the businesses. So I would say that\u2019s just sort of background on the evolution of the thinking, if you will.","And then the Crotonville exercise was quite interesting. We had half a dozen people come in, many of whom were ex-GE executives that had gone on to other companies. And we went through what are the things you kept, what made sense, what was helpful. So, that was added to the thinking that we already brought to the table and there clearly are companies that have done this well including Danaher.","So, I wouldn\u2019t size this number right now, but I would just say we think it could be meaningful on the cost front at the GE corporate level. We think it could be meaningful in the businesses as well. And then I think the main benefit of this overall over time though is better accountability and really pushing the onus of execution and that sense of ownership down into the business units.","Operator","Next we have Scott Davis from Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys.","John Flannery","Good morning, Scott.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Scott Davis","I\u2019m trying to get a sense of just in the Power business explicitly, and really two small questions here. But one is what is the cost of quality going to \u2013 what did it hit you this quarter, what do you think it will hit you this year? And is the $2 billion still the right number? I mean, that $2 billion cost out was based on probably a higher market forecast, certainly a higher market forecast and maybe even a higher longer-term market forecast maybe as you guys have dug in a little bit deeper here. I will stop with that.","Jamie Miller","Yes, Scott, on the operational side, we are really making progress on that. We still have work to do there, but what I would tell you is that the numbers of issues we are seeing and the size of the issues we are seeing continues to go down. When you look at the real comparison to last year, or even the comparison to our previous guide, some of that is market like I talked about and some of that is a reduction in some of the operational issues we are seeing. But remember, we have got a really strong base cost out profile here.","And the actions John talked about are really being layered in beginning in the second half of last year and really throughout this year. And we see that is really pulling through and offsetting some of that incremental noise that we expect. The other piece \u2013 and I mentioned this earlier but I will just say it again \u2013 that I think is important to think about is that Scott Strazik came in to really run the Power Services business. There have been a number of actions Scott and the team have taken both around how they are organized, how they are running the business between the contractual piece and the transactional piece.","And then how they are putting in different changes around pricing, around sales incentive programs and other things that, honestly, that ramps as you go through the year too. And services and Power will tend to be I think a second half peak.","John Flannery","Scott, I would add one of the thing. Jamie hit the nail on the head on the costs; we just continue to work that item and Russell and the team are working that very hard. I would just underscore the team is battling extremely hard. I am watching this day in, day out. This is the top priority of our team here. And I\u2019d just say the Power team in a tough environment is digging in hard and really giving it every effort. We have made a lot of changes to the team, so not only in terms of the most senior leadership there but down a level \u2013 Jamie mentioned Scott.","We have a new services CFO, Chuck Nugent, who as I mentioned came over to the Gas Power Systems CEO. The commercial leader has changed, supply chain leader has changed. So in many ways watching this, it reminds me of the first year I had in Healthcare where just \u2013 you changed the team, the team coalesces around the focus on cost and improving the business. And it takes time, obviously it took us time to get into this dynamic and it will take us some time to work out it. But I\u2019d, again, applaud the team\u2019s efforts on this.","Operator","Next we have Andrew Obin from Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Andrew Obin","A couple of questions. So, transactional progression, because it seems profit wise that\u2019s a big swing for Power profitability. I guess you indicated it was up double-digits. Can you just sort of talk about what initiatives you are doing inside the transactional business in Power to drive this growth? And what can it be by year-end, how much visibility you have? And second just more geographic color inside\u2026","John Flannery","We don\u2019t give a very detailed focus of that business by numbers, but let me tell you a higher level. As we said, there\u2019s really two key factors here. One is visibility into outages in the non-contracted installed base. And then second obviously is the ability to penetrate, capture and get the right margins in that business.","We had an issue with visibility into the installed base. So when Scott got into that business last fall we were seeing that we had visibility around 40%. So we just were missing a significant amount of the opportunities there. And they have gone through an exhaustive method to catalog the installed base and make sure we have got good visibility there. That is trending up close to 90%.","So step one obviously is to know better what is going on in the market. And then the rest is shoe leather and sales coverage and making sure the teams have good value propositions, understand what to say in front of the customers, the right incentives. And we have, as I said earlier, specific sales incentives around this area of business and particularly the margin rate in this area of the business. So this is a blocking and tackling exercise on visibility and sales execution and we think it will yield results \u2013 good results.","Operator","Next we have Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","John Flannery","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","John, can you talk about your line of sight into the $5 billion to $10 billion in Industrial asset sales that you mentioned, and whether you think you will get the valuations that you want on these deals? And then stepping back from there, obviously there has been quite a bit of talk about bigger changes at GE, whether it\u2019s a bigger breakup or spins. Maybe can you give us any color as to what you are thinking at this point on the structure of the Company?","Jamie Miller","Yes, so Andy, maybe I will take the first piece of that and then throw it over to John for the portfolio piece. So on the dispositions \u2013 and John mentioned a number of these things early in the call, but Industrial Solutions, we see that closing in second quarter, $1.9 billion of cash. You probably saw the announcement a couple of weeks ago on Value-Based Care. That\u2019s another $1 billion probably third-quarter close if not second quarter. And then as we really start to move down the list with Distributed Power, a couple of Aviation platforms and Transportation we are seeing strong interest across the board.","Multiples will vary by the deals just because the industries are in different cycles, but we see line of sight to these planes landing as we start to get into the second half. The other piece, and I know people have asked this before, so maybe I will just throw it out, is we look at free cash flow going into 2019. If you assume all these close at the end of 2018, these represent about $1.2 billion of free cash flow ex-Industrial Solutions. That\u2019s another data point on that one.","John Flannery","And then, Andrew, just go back to maybe the principles that we went through before. So first and foremost, strong franchises concentrating, as we said, in Power, Aviation and Healthcare. Step one is to make sure we are running those businesses the best way we can and get the best results out of those businesses. I think we are seeing progress on that result, so that we step into any thinking about the portfolio really on our front foot with the businesses performing well, I think that is where we are. But ultimately we have to think through and I have to think through what is the environment and conditions that will help these businesses flourish not just in 2018 but five years ahead, 10 years ahead, 20 years ahead.","And in that regard basically we disclosed earlier and discussed earlier looking at all options. Ultimately it\u2019s a question of what\u2019s the right structure for resources, for organic and inorganic strategic flexibility, for the right level of management execution, for the right level of cost structure and things in the Company overall that we reference. And getting the right outcome for customers, for the employees and for the investors. So, there is no sacred cows. We are reviewing a number of structures. We are working through this right now in great detail with the Board, including our new Board members, we are being deeply thoughtful about this, purposeful about this.","And we will give you an update in the next couple of months, as we said earlier. So, there\u2019s a lot of work and engagement. The last thing I would say just, importantly, there are factors to consider. We see them as solvable and manageable, but I want to reiterate we are making no changes to the 2018 capital allocation framework, no change to our financial policies. We will honor all the commitments we have with employees and retirees and bondholders as we consider any options that we would look at.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Robert McCarthy from Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?","John Flannery","Yes.","Robert McCarthy","All right, I will keep it quick. In terms of the enumerated assets subject to divestiture, the $20 billion, can you give us an update of what you think the cash conversion, the Industrial free cash flow conversion on those businesses are? And the spirit of the question is what are we playing for here? Because you have got trendline CFOA of probably $11 billion to $13 billion. And from that standpoint with $3 billion of CapEx, what can we be playing for for Industrial free cash flow per share in a bull case in 2019?","Jamie Miller","So first, we don\u2019t give out 2019 guidance at this point. But I would say a couple of things. So, I mentioned before that these businesses that are in the disposition path represent about $1.2 billion of free cash flow for 2019, assuming they all sort of left at the end of the year and that\u2019s ex-Industrial Solutions. As you get into 2019 there is a couple of other things to remember, most importantly that we\u2019ve got a very heavy load of restructuring cash out this year that really drops as we go into 2019. And so, that offsets a lot, if not more, of the free cash flow exits that we have going. And then as we get into 2019 \u2013 as we get into later in the year we will lay out the earnings profile for the businesses. So hopefully that helps at least a little bit at the high-level.","John Flannery","One thing I would just add to that just to clarify, the $1.2 billion is the free cash flow of that grouping of assets. $5 billion to $10 billion is the cash \u2013 range of cash proceeds we see; the actual enterprise value and how those deals are structured would be quite higher than that. So you should not take one and divide by the other for multiple of them. Interest level on these assets is good and the multiples are attractive.","Matt Cribbins","All right, great. We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining today. Just as a reminder, the replay of today\u2019s call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. Next Wednesday we will be holding our annual shareholders meeting in Imperial, Pennsylvania; and, John, you will be at EPG on Wednesday, May 23.","John Flannery","That\u2019s right. Matt, I\u2019d just like to finish and just say, again, thanks to the GE team. It was a great performance in the quarter by the team, great effort, great focus. And one of the joys of my job is being able to watch you perform around the world. I had a chance to do that in the first quarter. But a reminder to the team and also to everyone else, it\u2019s a step forward in the 2018 plan, but we need to continue to execute, keep the focus there. And the only thing that matters at the end of the day really is delivering the full-year results for 2018 and that\u2019s what we will be focused on. So thanks and we will see you at EPG. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

Please proceed.","Matthew Cribbins ","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release, presentation and supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff Bornstein.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey Immelt ","Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment just to give you an economic read from the world of GE. We see the US getting a little bit better everyday, Europe is slightly improving, overall, China remains good for GE. Resource rich markets are mixed. We expect to have positive revenue in places like the Middle East, Latin America and Africa. ","Meanwhile, Russia and Australia will be tough. We are seeing the world that we plan for. Industrial EPS grew by 14% despite having $0.03 of uncovered restructuring. Operating EPS was $0.31 excluding the impact of the capital announcement. Organically, orders were up 1% and revenue grew 3%. Industrial segment profit grew by 9% or 12% organically with margins up 120 basis points. ","Oil and gas had a solid first quarter. Organically, they were positive in orders with revenue flat. Profit was up 11% organically. The oil and gas market remains volatile with some segments under pressure. However, our diversified oil and gas platforms delivered in the first quarter. We are on track for our targets in 2015.","We are running the company well. We spent a bit of time last week discussing capital allocation. I would only reiterate that we are on full execution of our GE Capital plan. All of our CFOA targets and capital allocation goals are in line with our framework. We remain on track for industrial EPS of $1.10 to $1.20. ","Orders were up 1% organically and we finished the quarter with $263 billion of backlog. Again, oil and gas orders were up 2% organically, as they closed a few big Subsea deals. Orders pricing declined slightly. ","Service orders were up 3% organically with broad based strength. Aviation spares grew by 31% and remained robust. We remain on track for strong orders in predictivity in 2015. New installed orders for healthcare, IT grew substantially in the first quarter. We launched asset performance management in the manufacturing space. Orders for transportation, software and solutions are planned to be up 50% for the year and we expect consistent growth for wind power up [and EGPs] [ph] for the year. ","We saw some encouraging signs in the quarter. Aviation remains very strong recording $800 million on LEAP orders. The LEAP has won 79% of all neo and max orders. LEAP engines for Neo and C-919 are flying and the LEAP for Boeing is in the test plane and flying soon. The engine is ahead of schedule. The LEAP engine has been one of our most successful product launches in history. ","Healthcare equipment orders grew by 5% in the US. Transportation continues to record global wins and they received a $350 million order in Angola. Power conversion grew orders by 10% and we have solid orders performance in China of 54%. ","We expected power to have tough comps in the first quarter. In addition, they saw several orders slip into the second quarter. But overall, we see good demand for units in North America, Japan, Saudi, North Africa, Mexico and Brazil and we anticipate a strong power orders recovery in the second quarter. Orders support our organic growth target for the year. ","Our businesses executed well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 3%. Geographic growth is balanced. US was up 2% and growth markets were up 6%. We saw strength in China up 6%, Middle East, up 19%, Africa up 11% and Latin America up 13%. ","From a business standpoint, we had organic growth in six or seven segments, and we have forecast organic growth of up 2% to 5% and remain on track for that. Margins continue to be a good story with growth of a 120 basis points. We have targeted 50 basis points of gross margin expansion for the year and we hit 90 basis points in the first quarter. ","We had favorable mix value gap and productivity in the quarter. Meanwhile, simplification continues to drive good results and we are seeing more benefits ahead. One of the goals for 2015 is to expand margins in both equipment and service. We grew equipment margins by 120 basis points and service by 70 basis points in the quarter. We are making progress on margins as a company.","Industrial CFOA was $900 million. It was less than expected. Our shortfall was driven by some aviation supply chain disruptions in power and water orders timing. We will recover this in the second quarter. At the half, we plan on CFOA to be significantly higher than a year ago and we are on track for CFOA goals for the year. ","Our balance sheet remains quite strong. In the future, we will continue to look at ways to achieve a more efficient balance sheet. From a capital allocation standpoint Alstom remains on track for the second half close. We always expected that this deal would get a second look in the US and Europe. ","Alstom is impacted by similar volatile market dynamics as GE. But we continue to see this as a good strategic international fit for us and we intend on completing a deal that is good for investors. ","Now over to Jeff. ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Thanks, Jeff. I will start with the first quarter summary. As we discussed last week, we took a significant day one charge related to the exit of the non-vertical assets of GE Capital. On this page, I will start with the underlying financial performance of the company, excluding those charges and then on the next page, I\u2019ll walk you back to our reported financials. ","We had revenues of $33.1 billion, which were down 3% in the quarter driven by GE Capital which was down 7%. Industrial sales of $23.8 billion were down 1%. Operating earnings of $3.1 billion were down 5% on lower GE Capital earnings. Operating earnings per share of $0.31 were down 6%, with Industrial EPS up 14% and GE Capital EPS down 21%. ","Continuing EPS of $0.27 includes the impact of non-operating pensions and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. As Jeff said, CFOA for the quarter is $1.3 billion. We had Industrial CFOA of $900 million and received $450 million of dividends from GE Capital. Industrial cash flow was lighter than our expectations driven by the timing on progress collections, particularly in power and water and the impact of an aviation supply chain issue on inventory. These timing issues will reverse in the second and third quarter and our expectation is that the Industrial cash flow will be stronger in 2Q and will be up substantially for the first half versus last year. ","The GE Capital exit significantly impacts our tax rate for the quarter. As a result, we are providing both the reported tax provisions and tax rates on the bottom left side of the chart. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 23%, in line with guidance we provided. The reported GE ","Capital tax rate is not meaningful as the charges to shrink the company cause there to be a $6.2 billion tax expense, while there is a significant pretax loss. ","As we noted previously, GE Capital have a higher tax rate going forward and we expect variability in the tax rate as we transition the business through the next few years. On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% reported and up 3% organically reflecting about four points of headwind from foreign exchange. ","Foreign exchange was approximately $940 million drag on Industrial segment revenue and about $120 million impact on op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 21% primarily driven by lower Synchrony earnings, due to the minority interest and lower assets. ","I\u2019ll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in a couple of pages, but first, I want to walk these results to our reported financials. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, as we said, Industrial operating earnings were $1.6 billion, up 14% and GE Capital earnings were $1.5 billion for total operating earnings of $3.1 billion. ","Including non-operating pension, continuing earnings were $2.7 billion. We had approximately $80 million benefit in discontinued operations associated with the sale of our consumer mortgage business in Australia to bring net earnings to $2.8 billion.","The next column is the impact of GE Capital exit announcements as we reviewed with you last week. As we discussed, we took a $14 billion charge associated with classifying businesses and assets that\u2019s held for sale and a $6 billion tax charge. We also took a $2.3 billion disc ops charge principally reflecting the real estate transaction. ","After adjusting first quarter operations for these items, the reported amounts are shown in the third column. So $2.8 billion of operations net earnings offset by $16.4 billion of GE Capital charges works to the reported $13.6 billion net earnings loss for the first quarter or a loss of $1.35 per share. ","As we move to the execution plan we shared with you last week, there will be adjustments and we will continue to keep you updated on progress and the impacts of those actions. ","Next on other items. We don\u2019t have a long list this quarter. We had $0.03 related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the cost structure of the company. ","This was $422 million on a pretax basis. But about a third of that related to restructuring oil and gas. As we discussed before, we are taking aggressive actions to reduce our cost footprint given the challenging environment and the team are laser-focused on execution. ","For the year, we will continue to execute on restructuring projects with urgency. As you are aware, we are expecting some gains this year from appliances and signaling transaction. In the profile on the bottom of the page, we have assumed that appliance gain in the second quarter and the signaling gain in the second half, but both are subject to regulatory approval. ","Although there will be quarterly variability in gains and restructuring time, we expect gains to equal restructuring for the year on an EPS basis. ","Next I will give an update on power and water. Orders for the quarter were $4.5 billion were down 21% driven by equipment orders down 29% and services down 15%. Orders were lighter than expected due to financing delays and timing of agreements, but not competitive losses. ","For example, we signed a deal for two 7F gas in this week that we expected to sign in the first quarter. Our framework for wind and thermal orders has not changed for the year and we expect second quarter orders to be up double-digits. In the first quarter, we booked 21 gas turbines versus 31 a year ago and 376 wind turbines versus 422 turbines in the first quarter of 2014.","In terms of edge technology, we reported another order for a 90K in Latin America and this brings the backlog to 16 units. In addition, we\u2019ve been technically selected on an additional 37 units and are bidding an incremental 50 units beyond that. ","Distributed power equipment orders were down 53%, driven by a nine fewer turbines. We expect distributed power turbines orders to be roughly flat for the year. Gas engine orders were lower by 39% in the quarter driven by softer demand in gas compression. Overall, DPE will continue to be soft for the year. ","Service orders were down 15% with PGFs down 20%, driven by no repeat of a large upgrade in Japan a year ago and lower new unit installs. EGP orders were 16, down one year-over-year. No change in outlook for EGPs or services for the total year.","Revenue of $5.7 billion was higher by 4%, but was up 9% ex foreign exchange. Equipment revenues were up 1% on very strong thermal volume. We shipped 39 gas turbines versus 17 a year ago, that was partially offset by distributed power down 37%, and renewables down 30% on lower unit shipments of 15 and 175 respectively. Service revenues were higher by 7%, driven by higher upgrades including EGP upgrades 21 versus 17 a year ago. ","Operating profit of $871 million was down 2%, that\u2019s flat ex foreign exchange driven by higher volume offset by negative productivity and supply chain and engineering associated with the H ramp and negative product mix due to lower distributed power. Value gap in the quarter was a positive $12 million. ","Op profit margins were down 90 basis points in the quarter. We remain on track with the outlook we provided and we expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders and shipments this year with a good pipeline of activity. We still expect wind shipments of around 3000 to 3200 turbines and AGP upgrades remain on track and distributed power will remain pressured throughout the year. ","Next I\u2019ll cover oil and gas. Oil and gas orders of $4.3 billion were down 6% reported, but up 2% organically. Equipment orders of $2.2 billion were down 10% flat organically. Service orders were down 27% on a weak North American activity and TMS\u2019s orders were down 23% with no repeat of two large LNG orders we took in the first quarter of last year. It was still a decent order this quarter for TMS which booked more than $700 million of new orders in the quarter. ","Subsea and drilling orders were up 74% on large deals we booked in Ghana and Brazil. Service orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% and up 4% organically. Surface was lower by 21% and TMS was down 8% largely due to foreign exchange. ","Subsea was strong up 21%, MNC was down 1% organically. Revenues of just under $4 billion were flat year-over-year organically and down 8% reported. Reported negative 3% include seven points of foreign exchange and one point of disposition. ","Equipment revenues were down 13% with TMS down 9% reported, but up 22% ex foreign exchange and Subsea down 8% reported, but up 6% ex exchange. MNC was down 8% organically in the quarter and service revenues were down 2% reported but up 4% organic with Surface down 23% and MNC up 11% organically. ","Operating profit was up 11% organically, down 3% reported driven by negative FX offset by strong productivity of both base cost and product and service cost. Price was a $5 million drag in the first quarter, but the business delivered positive value gap. ","Margins improved 50 basis points reported and were 120 basis points better ex the impact of exchange on earnings. This will be a challenging year in oil and gas, but the team has been aggressive on remaking the cost structure of the business and we believe that we remain within the scenarios that supported our total year industrial guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. ","Next I will cover Aviation. Air travel continues to be very robust. Global passenger kilometers grew 5.3% through February 2015 versus the same period last year with the Middle East up 8.8%, Asia-Pacific up 7.3%. Through February, freight traffic grew 7.5% compared with a year ago with very strong double-digit growth in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. ","Orders in the quarter of $7.5 billion were up 36%, equipment orders of $3.9 billion were up 64% on higher commercial engine orders of $3.3 billion, up over two times versus the prior year. ","This was driven by a $1.2 billion of GEnx engine orders up ten times versus last year from Kuwait Airlines, Emirates and includes a GE9X order for Cathay. GEnx received $360 million in orders, up three times and we also recorded $800 million of orders for LEAP up three times. Our total win rate for the LEAP since program launch for the next-gen narrow body aircraft is 79%. Commercial engine backlog was up 35% year-over-year. Military equipment orders were down 61% driven by no repeat of two large orders from Sikorsky in Qatar Air Force from the first quarter of last year as expected. ","Service orders were up 14% on strong commercial spare parts which were up 31% at $38.9 million a day, the military spares were down 11%. ","Revenues of $5.7 billion were down 2%. Equipment revenues were down 8% with commercial equipment revenue down 1% on lower GEnx shipments. We shipped 19 fewer units than last year, 51 versus 70 and 29 less units in our plan as a result of a supply chain disruption. ","Military equipment revenue was down 32% on lower shipments and service revenue was up 4% with commercial spare parts up 28% and Military ","Services up 3%. Op profit was up 18% on very strong value gap, variable cost productivity and favorable GEnx mix, partially offset by lower volume and higher R&D. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. ","The impact of the lower GEnx shipments improved the margin write by about 90 basis points. This is net of some cost to remediate the disruption. We are working the issue and we expect to ship most of the delayed units in 2Q and be back on plan for the full year of 275 to 300 GEnx units. ","Aviation had another strong quarter growing equipment and service backlog by 23% and 9% respectively. The business continues to execute on new technology introductions. Service offerings and cost out. Aviation could perform better than we outlined at the December Outlook Meeting.","Next healthcare, orders of $4.2 billion were down 1%, but up 4% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. We saw its continued growth in the US of 5%. Europe was down 4%, but up 11% ex FX. ","Japan was down 18%, down 6% in ex FX. The Middle East was down 43%, driven by Saudi, and China was down 4%. Healthcare system orders were down 5% flat excluding the impact of foreign exchange. US Imaging and Ultrasound was up 7% with strong growth in MR up 41% in the quarter, partially driven by the new PET MR released in December. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. ","Life science orders were up 10%, up 17% excluding foreign exchange driven by strong bio process orders. This was offset with core imaging down 3% and services. Revenues of $4.1 billion were down 3%, but up 2% ex foreign exchange. Healthcare system revenues were down 6% flat organically and life science revenues were up 4%.","Operating profit was up 3% with 80 basis points of margin expansion driven by strong cost execution, partially offset by lower price. Looking forward, we expect similar market dynamics. We believe we are gaining share in key modalities in the US and we expect the market to continue to improve. While China has slowed, we expect orders growth for the remainder of the year in China. Life science growth will persist and the business team continues to execute on its cost out programs. ","In Transportation, North American carloads were up 1.8% within intermodal traffic up 2.1%, which was impacted by the West Coast Port Strait. Commodities have seen broad based increases with agriculture up 4.6%, and chemicals and petroleum products up 3.2%. Coal volumes were down 2.5% in the quarter. ","Transportation orders were down 38% with equipment orders down 56% and services were higher by 13%. Equipment orders were lower driven by locomotives, primarily due to not repeating the large South Africa deal we had in the first quarter of last year. ","Revenues in the quarter were up 7% driven by strong equipment growth. We shipped 215 locos in the quarter versus 178 a year earlier. Overall, mining continues to be soft, down 23%. Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% on higher locomotive volumes, material deflation and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded by 70 basis points. We now have 16 pre-production tier-4 units out with our customers running on the rails. They are performing an actual operating condition as part of our validation process. We had about 1200 tier-4 locos in backlog at the end of the first quarter of 2015 and we expect to ship about half those this year. ","On energy management, orders of $2.1 billion were down 3% and up 2% organically. Power Conversion orders were up 10% in the quarter. Industrial Solutions was up 4% and Digital Energy was down 38% from no repeat of a large domestic meter order from last year. ","Power Conversion saw strong growth in Renewables vertical up two times on solar inverters and the marine vertical was up 15% on a large Canadian proportion dynamic positioning deal in Canada, offset partially by softer oil and gas orders. Backlog for our Energy Management business grew 3%.","Revenues were up 1% and up 8% organically driven by foreign exchange with Power Conversion up 6%, Digital Energy and Industrial Systems were both above flat. Op profit was $28 million, up from $5 million last year on a reported basis. The business continues to benefit from restructuring with strong base cost productivity driven by SG&A reductions and positive value gap, offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. ","Margin rates in the quarter were up 140 basis points. We expect program execution and margin rate improvement to continue throughout 2015. And then finally, Appliances and Lighting. Revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. Industry core units were flat with retail down 1% and contract up 4%. The industry volume was well below the first quarter expectation of plus 8% due to the harsh weather across the US. We believe GE increased our share by two points in the first quarter. ","Lighting revenues were down 3% on lower traditional product demand which was down 18%. This was partially offset by continued strong LED performance, which grew 76% in the quarter. LED now makes up 30 plus percent of lighting revenues and that\u2019s up from 17% of lighting revenues in the first quarter of 2014. Op profit in the quarter was $103 million. ","Now on GE Capital. Before we start with the GE Capital results, I just like to take a moment highlighting incredible work done by Keith and GE Capital team. Keith led an enormous and complicated effort in a very challenging window of time to get the company to this very important strategic pivot. ","This is a transformational change for our company that will create real value for investors long-term. This has covered the impact of last week\u2019s announcement is reflected in GE Capital\u2019s first quarter reported financials. ","On the page, we have provided a lock starting with the earnings from our vertical businesses which generated $352 million for the quarter. Operating earnings from the remainder of our businesses and continuing operations amounted to $1.1 billion, which was more than offset by $14 billion day one accounting adjustments related to last week\u2019s announcement. ","Earnings from continuing operations amounted to a net loss of $12.5 billion. Discontinued operations generated additional losses of $2.2 billion which reflect the charges associated with our commercial real estate business. ","Overall, GE Capital reported a $14.7 billion loss including $6 billion of tax expenses. We ended the quarter with $303 billion of E&I excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong and we ended the quarter at $76 billion including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remained at $25 billion and we had $8 billion of long-term debt issuance for the quarter. ","As discussed last week, we do not anticipate additional issuances over the next five years and we expect GE Capital CB balance to decrease to $5 billion by the end of the year. Starting this quarter, we are transitioning the capital adequacy reporting from Basel 1 to Basel 3 inline with industry practice. ","Our Basel 3 Tier-1 common ratio was 10.6% inclusive of the day one charges. We expect this ratio to improve as we dispose the risk-weighted assets over the course of the year. As I mentioned last Friday, we will operate through the transition in a safe and sound manner working with our regulators and determining the appropriate capital level. ","Going forward, the team will be very focused on executing the portfolio transformation. As we discussed last week, we have signed deals on close to 50% of the planned E&I reduction for the year and we are receiving very strong inbound interest on many of our portfolio since the discussion last week. We are prioritizing transaction in a way that allows us to maximize franchise value and as I said last week, we will be very transparent as we execute through this process. ","Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter in line with our prior guidance and are now fully focused on delivering on the portfolio transformation that we shared with you last week. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Jeff. We remain on track for a 2015 operating framework but we will adjust our guidance milestones to reflect last week\u2019s announcement on capital. Industrial EPS is on track for $1.10 to $1.20 and we are running our businesses to the high-end of that range. We are generating solid organic growth in margin expansion. Corporate costs are being well managed with gains equal to restructuring and oil and gas is performing to our expectations. ","We continue to invest in Industrial growth. Between research and development, investment in plant equipment and information technology, and the potential for industrial M&A, we will invest $10 billion to $15 billion each year in our industrial growth. We can do this and so return significant capital to investors. The GE Capital verticals are tracking to $0.15 per share and as Jeff said, we are focused on the verticals and we\u2019ll keep them top of mind.","We\u2019ve set a target of $90 billion in asset sales and this is part of our guidance. We already have approximately 50% announced and have robust pipeline to achieve this by year end. Again, we will update this at EPG. Free cash flow remains on track to $12 billion to $15 billion, dispositions and CFOA on track and we expect GE Capital to dividend between $500 million and $7 billion in line with what we talked about last week and we will update this as we go through the year. ","We will continue to drive industrial-friendly capital allocation. The dividend remains a top priority. We are still expecting the Synchrony split to return $20 billion to you in the form of a share exchange. And as you saw last week, our Board has authorized a $50 billion buyback based on the proceeds from the GE Capital sale. So between Synchrony, the buyback and dividends, we can return $90 billion to investors over the next few years. ","The company is executing well operationally and strategically. Our compensation plans have aligned us with investors and we expect to have a solid second quarter and total year. ","Matt, now back to you for some questions. ","Matthew Cribbins","Great, thanks, Jeff. I will now turn it over to the operator to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. ","Scott Davis ","Hi guys. Good morning. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Scott.","Scott Davis ","I was intrigued by your couple of comments that you made, but Jeff Bornstein the comment you made on incoming interest into the asset sales. I mean, give us a sense of \u2013 and I think the question really is, give us a sense of your availability to sell those assets quicker than you laid out in your timetable, meaning, are the books out, do you have \u2013 if the sovereign showed up tomorrow could you hand them the keys and few months later it\u2019s you can get the deal done or is there some gating factors that could limit the timing? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, I would say, Scott, the amount of inbound interest has been incredible in both non-banks and banks, both domestic and international interest. So, I think that we are buoyed by the demand that we see so far. It really depends on the platform and the type of transaction we are talking about and we are organized to be able to do this as quickly as possible. ","Our goal is to monetize these assets, these platforms as fast as we can. There will be some gating challenges on getting ourselves into position to \u2013 as you describe to get all the books together, et cetera, et cetera. But we are going to go out to this as fast as humanly possible and I think the positive point here is the level of interest is really quite incredible. ","Scott Davis ","Okay. That\u2019s good and then, Jeff Immelt you made a comment in your prepared remarks about wanting to get to an efficient balance sheet or something in that regard and I really hadn\u2019t heard you mention those terms before, I mean, how do you think of an inefficient industrial balance sheet? Is there some sort of a range of leverage or some way to measure that? ","Jeffrey Immelt","I think, Scott, in the near term, I think you have to think about us as safe and secure and marching through this process with GE Capital and things like that. Over the long-term, I think our desire is to have an industrial looking balance sheet and how fast that goes, again depends on Jeff\u2019s answer earlier on GE Capital assets and things like that, but our goal is to have over time to have investors look at GE as an industrial company and have a balance sheet that lines up more or less with our peers in that space. ","Scott Davis ","Okay. And then last just a clean-up item, what impact on margins was currency in the quarter? Did you have a benefit from hedges in the margin improvement? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","No, actually, FX was a drag in margins in the quarter. ","Scott Davis ","Okay.","Jeffrey Bornstein","As I talked about in the Industrial segment margin, we had about $120 million FX drag and hedges were a very small offsets to the total impact. We actually had negative impacts all in. ","Scott Davis ","Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Great, Scott. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Bernstein. ","Steven Winoker ","Thanks and good morning. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Steve. ","Steven Winoker ","Hey, just can we go to that $1.10 to $1 framework. I heard you say, that you are running the businesses to the high-end of that range. Maybe an idea of what does that mean and also how much \u2013 can you just remind us how much of that is Alstom? ","Jeffrey Immelt","Again Steve, the way to think about that is, we have an AIP plan, a compensation plan and that lines up with how the internal business plans work. So, I think we talked to you guys, Steve at the year end meeting at EPG about the comp plan, we have the team too. So when you look at the AIP plan that frames compensation for the leadership team that\u2019s what I referred to and it\u2019s really the same comment I made in January about how we are running the place. I think with Alstom, Steve, we are counting on $0.01 for the year. So, not really much impact in 2015 and more so in 2016. ","Steven Winoker ","So, maybe just sticking on that then and maybe this is to Jeff Bornstein on this one. How are you - if we just walked our way from again this $0.31 and given the trending of oil and gas, what \u2013 just maybe, I think having just a little challenge given the weakness we are seeing in other companies bringing down guidance in oil and gas and related areas what give you guys the confidence of getting to that over the next three quarters and more than sequential second half ramp and things like that? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Listen, I think that the scenarios that we shared with you at year end, we updated again in the first quarter call. I am sorry \u2013 in the first quarter on the fourth quarter call. We evaluated a number of different scenarios around oil and gas. As we communicated to you, all of those scenarios we felt were within the range of $1.10 or $1.20. ","We\u2019ve got the team, Lorenzo and the team are executing like crazy on a substantial cost plan. They are at right on track, actually slightly ahead of schedule. They are going to take out close to $600 million of cost of this year, both base cost and product and service cost. ","So, when we take a look at where we ended here in the first quarter with oil and gas and how we think about the balance in the next three quarters and very importantly, with all the restructuring that we are doing, the benefits of that largely in the second half of the year, we feel like today, based on everything we know, that those scenarios and that guidance that we gave you remains in tact. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Let me add just a little bit to what Jeff said. I think he framed this year well. I think if the quarter, the guys are actually probably a little bit better than what we had anticipated, but you see all the volatility in the market and this is going to \u2013 it\u2019s just going to be something we have to continue to evaluate quarter-by-quarter. ","But at the same time, I think one of the advantages we have at GE is, we can look at other businesses that have the potential to do better and over the context of the company, we\u2019ve got a framework that we are confident in even if other scenarios in oil and gas take place. So I think that\u2019s one of the strengths of GE you\u2019ve seen the way Aviation got out of the gate and that some businesses get a chance to provide some upside maybe during the year. ","Steven Winoker ","Okay, and then just lastly on this topic. The 1.4% order pricing, negative order pricing in oil and gas again, that is really - how should we think about that in terms of \u2013 are these additional, is there any additional re-negotiation or existing backlog happening or is this new and where are you seeing the weakness on that front? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, so, when you look at order pricing, Steve, that 1.4% is almost entirely associated with the Ghana Subsea order we took. So it\u2019s not broadly across the portfolio. We have not re-negotiated any prices from existing backlog. So that\u2019s where we are today. ","Steven Winoker ","Okay, I will hand it on. Thanks a lot. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Great. Great Steve, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America. ","Andrew Obin ","Yes, good morning. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Andrew. ","Andrew Obin ","Just, yes, maybe I\u2019ll let others ask questions on oil and gas, let's focus a little bit elsewhere. As I look into 2016 and what about renewables, and I guess I will touch on oil and gas, what about Subsea because the industry timing on Subsea suggests that orders will be very strong this year, but what does it mean for 2016 in power and water and oil and gas given the specific regulatory dynamic and industry-specific dynamic in these two sub-segments?","Jeffrey Immelt","So, I think, with renewables, again, what I would say Andrew is, we always think about the US in the context of the PTC. And there is nothing we see today that indicates that the PTC is not going to get rolled over in some capacity. ","So that kind of keeps the US at a kind of let\u2019s say steady state and then when you look around the world, you see growth. I mean, I think if you look at Brazil, if you look at places in Europe, if you look at even Africa and Middle East, we see pretty good growth. China, we see pretty good growth in wind globally. So\u2026.","Jeffrey Bornstein","I think we are thinking we\u2019ll do another 3000 turbines is our current estimate in 2016 as well. There is a shift. There is going to be more international than domestic as we move forward, no question about that. But roughly the same kind of volumes.","Jeffrey Immelt","I think the way to think about Subsea is, on an incoming order standpoint, each project that\u2019s going to get a ton of scrutiny whether it\u2019s the Ghana project that we signed or Bonga in Nigeria or projects in Australia or things like that. But once a project is going that\u2019s unlikely that it will be stopped. In other words, you already have fixed cost and when it gets into the production mode, it\u2019s unlikely that it\u2019s going to slow down. So, we still think Subsea in 2015 and 2016 are going to be okay within that context.","Andrew Obin ","And just to follow-up a little bit shorter-term looking into the second quarter you highlighted some delays in Power and Water and Aviation. So, if these two segments recover actually into the second quarter, what does it imply for organic Industrial growth in the second quarter? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, I think at the moment, here we\u2019ve given you guidance for the year. We expect organic growth will be 2% to 5% for the year, we were 3% here in the first quarter. I think that\u2019s generally the trend we expect to be on throughout the year.","Andrew Obin ","But directionally, they would imply that ex oil and gas there should be some room for acceleration in the rest of the business, right?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Again, we see those segments getting better in the second quarter, but again, we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we just don\u2019t want to do organic revenue each quarter-by-quarter, Andrew.","Andrew Obin ","Okay, I tried. ","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, we are comfortable in the range and we leave the rest to you.","Andrew Obin ","I tried. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan ","Good morning guys. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan ","Hey, so, maybe just on the equipment margin improvement, 120 basis points, pretty impressive, it looks like some benefit from mix in the quarter. As we go forward, I mean, assuming you can't count on that mix every quarter, value gap, cost productivity and some of those things Jeff Bornstein and Dan Heintzelman are working on, does that ramp as quickly as 2Q, 3Q and maybe just a little expectation on how you see that equipment margin playing out through the year?","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, we expect the initiatives that teams are going and that Dan and I are working with the businesses on will gain momentum as we move throughout the year. As you saw on Jeff\u2019s page, when you walk through the margins, we had 60 basis points of mix. ","I think what we talked about at year end when we talked about the year was, mix that probably wanted to be hopefully would be something more neutral. So, I would expect us to do to gain momentum on the cost line and product service cost line and we\u2019ll see what mix plays out. But I would assume for the year that mix will be roughly neutral. ","Shannon O'Callaghan ","And any segments so far as you are kind of attacking that cost structure, any segments that you are particularly encouraged by the opportunity you have seen? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","I think every singe one of these business have enormous opportunity. I mean, when you look at the first quarter results, I mean, particularly around equipment margins, just about every business had improvement with the exception of power and water and oil and gas. So I think that it\u2019s not unique to any one business every one of these businesses has an enormous opportunity to get products and service cost at another level.","Shannon O'Callaghan ","Okay, and then just - maybe on Alstom, Jeff Immelt, you mentioned some of the difficult trends in the market but Alston would be facing that you are also seeing, obviously. Can you still get to sort of the plan there even if the markets are a little tougher and then any update in terms of the regulatory process and how some of the concerns of the European Commission around heavy-duty gas turbine concentration might be remedied?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, I would say, let me answer the second piece first, Shannon. I would say, there is nothing really that\u2019s been a big surprise as we go through this. So, we always thought that there would be a second request or that process would take until this summer and so, I would say, so far nothing really is a surprise. ","I think on the financials, we still look for a high-teens return and $0.16 accretion in 2016. So we still feel that is achievable and synergies are quite robust and we like that. And the last thing I would say is, look, at he end of the day, just like every deal, we have always reserve as we do these transactions that will only do deals that are investor-friendly and that achieve good returns. And so I think we have established that in this case and I think we are optimistic about how Alstom fits with GE.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell ","Hi, thank you. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Julian.","Julian Mitchell ","Hi, just a question on power and water. The services orders were down a decent amount, sales though were up. So maybe give a little bit of color around what\u2019s going on in the Thermal Services business in particular by region, because it does seems as if the orders are softer, AGP as well, and sales are still okay.","Jeffrey Immelt","So, Julian I\u2019ll start with, orders were soft year-over-year largely because we had a very large upgrade in Japan last year that we just didn\u2019t repeat this year. Secondly, the number of new unit installs that the Services business worked on in the quarter were fewer year-over-year. ","So that\u2019s most of what we saw in softness in power-gen services. AGPs are flat. We told you we think we do about 100 for the year. We will do 100 for the year. I don\u2019t think we are changing any of the outlook there. So, I don\u2019t think there is a broad team here even geographically around power-gen services.","Operator","Our next question comes from Barbara Noverini with Morningstar.","Barbara Noverini ","Good morning everybody. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Good morning Barbara. ","Barbara Noverini ","So is predictivity growth tracking your expectations since you spoke about your plans back in the fall and can you talk about which of your operating segments are driving the most demand for predictive analytic solutions this year?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, so, we see again \u2013 I would say, 30% to 40% growth, pretty consistently across the business in software and predictivity, I just had a review with all the businesses last week. And so, there is a variety of different \u2013 and there is \u2013 I\u2019d say, clearly, the power and power upgrade, things like power-up on the wind turbine side, we\u2019ve got 10 installs, but really another 100 behind that, that\u2019s quite exciting. ","As I mentioned the rail business has got in expectations grow about orders about 50% for the year. So we are seeing both from a software and things like movement plan our size are growing. The radiology ITPs is up 13% in terms of new bookings in the quarter. So, some pretty good activity there. ","We\u2019ve kind of launched what we call Assets Performance Management APM in oil and gas. So we are seeing an original service funnel in that activity. So, I\u2019d say, macro kind of in the 30% to 40% range with strong double-digits in each business as we look at software and predictivity for the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC. ","Deane Dray ","Thank you. Good morning everyone. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray ","Hey, just a couple of questions on the Aviation side, that spares number being up 31% really jumps out and do you see changes in airline behavior, is this coming through because of lower fuel and how sustainable is this through 2015?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, you heard the revenue, the volume numbers are pretty good. Revenue passenger miles, very, very strong. There is no question that most of the forecast are that the Aviation industry globally, or probably have a most profitable year in history this year. I think IATA was estimating almost $25 billion of profit. And the airlines are no question stocking inventory. ","You\u2019ll recall that, 2012, there was a really large destocking that went on and since that de-stocking in 2012, spares have improved each of the last couple of years. So, maybe that the airlines based on the profitability to operations are more aggressively replenishing some of that de-stocking that happened a few years ago. But very strong. ","Now, we don\u2019t expect that rate of 31% to persist for the year. I think, we talked about double-digits and we are probably talking about mid double-digits, mid-teens, maybe. But it\u2019s not going to be 31% for the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. ","Jeff Sprague ","Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague ","Hey, good morning. Just wanted to kind of circle back around to Alstom. Given that there was kind of such an abrupt change in strategy around capital and you are achieving kind of your business next goal kind of through subtraction largely, how do you actually feel about Alstom here? Is that really the right asset and is there a way to back out of that if the EU is a little too demanding?","Jeffrey Immelt","Well, I would take that in two pieces. I\u2019d say the premise for the deal, Jeff, is relevant today as it\u2019s been in the past which is great complementary products, opportunity to drive excellent synergies, good return on investments and we feel at the, kind of four times EBITDA, post-synergies is a pretty attractive entry-point into an investment like that. So high double-digits returns and in a market we really know. ","And then, look, I think just like every \u2013 I would back up and say, the company has gotten probably 100 deals through the Brussels in the past decade, something like that. So, I think we know how to approach this and know how to get these things done. But just like every other deal we have ever done that just ever would become unattractive, we wouldn\u2019t do it. So that\u2019s so different than any other transaction we\u2019ve ever done as a company. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel. ","Robert McCarthy ","Hi, good morning everyone. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Rob.","Robert McCarthy ","Hey, it looks like we've reached the lightning round of the call. So I got one question from me. I'll make it count. In any event, just in terms of the timing of the divestiture of a large part of these GE Capital assets, I mean, obviously the inbound call volume is very encouraging, but at the end of the day given the size, scope and nature of a lot of these businesses, you\u2019re going to be dealing probably with a lot of large, SIFI like institutions, I mean, how do you reconcile the need for speed killing in terms of getting to these divestitures versus getting the right price and how are you thinking about those decisions and do you think the timeline is practical?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, I think the plan that Keith laid out with all of you last week, we laid out a plan that span a couple of \u2013 2.5 years ago, roughly. But that we thought that the bulk of this work would be done by the end of 2016. Now, we are going to try to outperform that. There is no question I think that, when we think about the risk associated with this including price and value, speed is the single biggest mitigate. We have a market today that\u2019s incredibly receptive to these kinds of assets. And so, we need to be able to capitalize on that. There is - no question, we\u2019ve got a balance from an execution standpoint, the nature of the buyer and the size of the transaction to the extent that we are relying on, maybe a back-end regulatory approval by the buyer, we are doing smaller transactions that maybe, maybe not, maybe better from a price perspective than doing several large big bulk deals. ","But, I think, my guess is that Keith and the team will run almost a parallel process. They will evaluate on both tracks, platform-by-platform, portfolio-by-portfolio, the level of interest there versus a couple several maybe much larger deals. They try to sweep up many of those platforms simultaneously. So, we are completely aware of exactly what you are asking and we have a process and we\u2019ll make sure that we evaluate on those sides, but speed is the key. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Rob, I just want to say that, the lifetime achievement award winner Joanna Morris is working in the phones this morning. So don\u2019t blame Jeff Bornstein or me for any of this activity. And I want to echo just what Jeff Bornstein said which is, you got to think about each one of these assets having multiple options for what we do. So, it\u2019s not like for any one of these, there is not like be one game plan. There is going to be multiple for every platform, ","Operator","And our next question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa ","Hey, good morning.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Steve, how are you? ","Steve Tusa ","Well. So, just to be clear, is the oil and gas guidance, what is that now for the year? I am not sure that was like an explicit comment on oil and gas and then if you could just opine on the - a little more clarity around what happened with the aviation supply chain, there has definitely been a lot of noise from maybe sub-suppliers and stuff like that around that supply chain. So just curious as to how you guys are kind of fitting into that puzzle?","Jeffrey Bornstein","We didn\u2019t anything on our guidance on oil and gas Steve, So, I think what we said is, down 0% to 5%, probably closer to 5%. We evaluated this scenario is to be on 5%. All those are concerted in the guidance we gave you at $1.10 and $1.20. We got the team executing to a plan that supports the $1.10 to $1.20. ","As Jeff talked about Keith incented the team and our targets internally on the higher end of that range, not the lower end of that range. So no change or anything we\u2019ve shared in the two calls previous to this. ","Jeffrey Immelt","And then, I would say, Steve, the production is ramping in 2Q and getting back on schedule and no real update other than what Jeff Bornstein said on the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie ","Thanks, Joanna and good morning everyone. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie ","The first question, I guess first and only question is really on the order of priority on the asset sales. Can you just discuss a little bit both on COL and consumer, and I guess specifically as it relates to US versus international, how you are thinking about the order of priority, because I would imagine that given your goal to de-designate the non-bank SIFI I would imagine would be focused on the US assets. So, any color there would be helpful.","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, where Keith and team are focused on first and foremost, those platforms where we might be more concerned about the franchise value itself, where the people are big component of the value creation process. So, he has prioritized the focus, based on that first. ","You are correct, I would say, the second order priority would be, we think in the US, our ability to execute quickly and in scale, is very favorable today and it is a big part of the discussion around the SIFI status. So, having said that, it\u2019s not that we are not going to do anything outside the US, we are going to be working the international platform in parallel here as well. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe ","Well, thanks, good morning. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe ","Hey, so Jeff, I think you are going to win the prize for most bullish CEO this quarter. The $1.20, I just wanted to kind of divine what you mean by working towards the high-end because right now consensus is close to $1.10. So, are you encouraged enough to raise our numbers and if so, do you see a path of 5% organic or is it primarily mid-point to low-point but offset by margins? So any comments there would be helpful.","Jeffrey Immelt","I think, Nigel, this is the exact same comment I made in January that just centers where the internal incentive plan and the internal incentive plan sits towards the high end of the range and we were transparent about this at year end and we were transparent about it in January and I am transparent about it April. Again, I think the value of a portfolio is that, you\u2019ve got a series of businesses that are doing well and you\u2019ve got markets that are still volatile out there and we just want to see how that continues to evolve, like I said earlier, like Jeff said, we are pleased with where oil and gas finished in the first quarter, but that market is extremely volatile right now. ","And we just want to see how we continue to progress, what happens in the marketplace. And let\u2019s see what happens. There is plenty of chance to make other changes as the year goes through. But let\u2019s see how we do quarter-by-quarter. And beyond that, look, I think we are \u2013 we\u2019ve got a good diversified set of businesses that are doing well in the industries we are in and we need to see how the world continues to evolve. ","Matthew Cribbins","Okay, couple of announcements before we wrap up. Next Wednesday, we\u2019ll hold our Annual Shareholders Meeting in Oklahoma City. On May 20th, Jeff will present at EPG and on June 16th, we\u2019ll hold Paris Air Show Investor Meeting and as always, we will be available later today to take your questions. Jeff? ","Jeffrey Immelt","Great Matt. Thanks, thanks everybody. We announced a lot last week on really positioning the company for the future. We are excited about that strategic change, that strategic pivot. The underlying performance of the company both Industrial and GE Capital is per our expectations for the year. We continue to make progress. We are pleased by the execution of the team in the first quarter and we look forward to the rest of the year. Thanks, Matt.

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. My name is Chanelle and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Trevor Schauenberg","Thank you, Chanelle. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s third quarter 2012 earnings webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning and the presentation slides are available via the webcast on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of the presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast we have our Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO Keith Sherin. Now I\u2019d like to turn over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Trevor, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Look, we had a good third quarter in a challenging environment. Europe is tough; Asian resource risk countries are okay and U.S. had packets of growth but still some uncertainty.","Revenue growth was good in the environment with organic growth up 8% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. We finished the quarter were $203 billion of backlog. Earnings were solid growing at 13%. Both industrial and capital had double-digit earnings growth in the quarter. Every industrial business had positive earnings growth for the first time since the third quarter of \u201805.And our simplification efforts are yielding results with corporate costs ahead of plan.","Margins grew by 70 basis points consistent with our expectations. CFOA is up 63% year-to-date and we\u2019ve repurchased $3 billion of stock. Importantly in this environment we remain on track for our 2012 framework.","For orders, orders were 21.5 billion, just in context for orders, factoring in some of the big items. They were up 4% ex-wind and excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Orders pricing was positive for the quarter and year-to-date. The down cycle and wind is as expected and gas turbine orders were fairly strong. We saw about $1 billion of orders push out from third quarter to fourth quarter and our backlog position is strong as we enter the fourth quarter and facing into 2013.","Our key growth engines remain on track. In fact every industrial business had positive organic growth in the quarter. Growth markets expanded by 9% including in China, up 23%, Africa up 22% and Latin America up 21%, we expect six of nine growth regions to have double-digit order growth at \u201812.","We had the highest services backlog in our history with expanding margins. And we\u2019ve launched successful products including the Flex 60, new subsea technology and new appliances. And our new aircraft engines are winning high market share. With our investments in place we should be able to sustain a solid growth rate into the future.","Our margins are a good story growing 70 basis points to 14.4%. We had expansion in every business, including Energy if you exclude the impact of our Wind business. The fundamentals remain strong as we finish the year. Our value gap will be positive in both 2012 and 2013. We remain on track for $2 billion-plus and structural cost-out to simplification efforts. We were able to do significant restructuring in the quarter. We\u2019re on track for 100 basis points of improvement in 2012 and 2013 in line with our plans.","Cash is a decent story with year-to-date total of $10.7 billion, up 63%. The dividend from capital is a positive story for investors. Our industrial CFOA has been pressured by an unusual equipment build, which should have positive growth in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re executing our capital allocation plans. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve paid out $5.4 billion in dividends and bought back $3 billion of GE stock. Our balance sheet is very strong and we end the quarter with $85 billion of consolidated cash.","Now over to Keith to review operations.","Keith Sherin","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019m going to start with the third quarter summary. We had continuing operations revenues of $36.3 billion. That was reported up 3% ex-FX. Revenues were up 6%. Industrial sales of $24.7 billion are up 7%, 10% ex-FX. GE Capital revenues of $11.4 billion were down 5% as we continue to reduce our assets. And our operating earnings of $3.8 billion were up 10%.","Operating earnings per share of $.36 were up 13%, and you can see the 13% excludes the impact of last year\u2019s third quarter preferred stock redemption commitment, which you\u2019ll remember was an 8% reduction in equity, obviously not having a repeat of that results in the huge fees here. So operating EPS is up 50%, continuing and net EPS are 43% and 50%. Continuing EPS includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations, which I\u2019ll cover on the next page.","As Jeff said, year-to-date cash of $10.7 billion was up 63% including the dividends from GE capital. And for taxes, the GE rate, 21% is consistent with the low 20s rate we forecast in the first two quarters, and the year-to-date rate is 22%. The 4% GE Capital rate\u2019s consistent with the mid single-digit rate that we forecasted at the end of the second quarter and we continue to expect to finish the year with a mid-single digit GE Capital tax rate.","On the right side, you can see the segment results with total Industrial segment profit up 11%, and it\u2019s great to have all five industrial segments delivering positive earnings growth. GE Capital also had another strong quarter with earnings up 11% so overall, a strong segment growth quarters. I\u2019m going to cover each of these segments in more detail in a minute.","Before I get into those business results, I\u2019ll take you through the other items from Q3. As we mentioned at the infrastructure investor meeting, we had $0.03 in one-time benefits related to the gain from NBCUniversal. The majority of the benefit was driven by the A&E transaction. NBCU sold its remaining 16% stake in A&E and our share of the gain was $0.03 after tax. We also had $0.03 after tax of restructuring and other charges in the quarter. These charges related primarily to continued cost structure improvements in Energy, Healthcare, Aviation, HNBS and GE capital. We also had a charge in the quarter related to the planned disposition of one of our plants as well as costs related to the acquisitions.","On the bottom of the page, there was minimal net impact from discontinued operations in the quarter. We resolved an outstanding item related to the plastics disposition that resulted in a $0.01 gain at the parent. And for WMC we had $1.3 billion of claims come in, in 3Q. That\u2019s significantly less in the second quarter, but higher than we had previously expected and that resulted in an after-tax reserve impact of $78 million in the quarter. So overall, EPS and one-time benefits and costs were relatively offsetting here.","So next I\u2019m going to go to the businesses, and I\u2019ll start with Energy. Before I get into it, this is the final quarter that we\u2019re going to be reporting Energy infrastructure on this basis, and so for the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be reporting the three new businesses after the reorganization: Power and Water, Oil and Gas, and Energy Management. And later this quarter, we\u2019ll begin providing you with historical data recast into these three businesses so you can begin modeling on that basis.","Let me look at the total business. I\u2019ll start with Energy first. Orders of $6.5 billion were down 17%. We\u2019ve said it before, but the impact of Wind is huge here. Ex-Wind, Energy orders were flat year-over-year. Equipment orders of $3.4 billion were down 24%. Again, ex-Wind, equipment orders were up 11%. Thermal orders of $1 billion were up over 160% and we had orders for 29 gas turbines versus 16 last year.","Renewable orders of $518 million were down 72%. We had orders for 241 wind turbines versus 781 last year. Total equipment order pricing was down 1.4% with Thermal down 2.6% and Renewable down 4.2%. Year-to-date Thermal order pricing is private positive the 0.8% and our estimate for the whole year is about flat for Thermal order pricing.","Service orders of $3.1 billion were down 8% by declines in Energy Management. Power Generation services of $1.7 billion were up 1%. Revenues of $8.9 billion were up 17% driven by the strong volume growth. We had Equipment revenue of $5.5 billion, which was up 30%. We had Renewable revenue of $2.1 billion, which was up 61%. We shipped a 1,014 wind turbines versus 633 last year.","Aeroderivative revenues of $679 million were up 84% on higher units, we had 44 units this year versus 31 last year and also larger units. Thermal revenues of $1.6 billion were down 19% driven by lower balance of Plant revenues, lower pricing and foreign exchange. Service revenues of $3.4 billion up 1% driven by Power and Water services. And segment profit of $1.2 billion was up 11% as the benefits of all that strong volume and our services strength more than offset the lower pricing. Power Gen services operating profit was up 15% in Q3.","Now we\u2019ve been breaking out the impact of wind because it masks the remaining business performance. If you take a look in the third quarter for energy x-wind in total, revenues would be up 8%, segment profits up 20% and margins would\u2019ve been up 146 basis points.","Oil and Gas, they had another great quarter. Orders of $4.2 billion were up 7%, up 12% SFX. Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were up 10% driven by growth in turbo-machinery and subsea systems. We had $300 million of orders for the Shineer LNG project, we had over $200 million of orders for the Westies pipeline projects in China and we also had over $500 million of order push-outs for two projects that we\u2019re working on in Angola and Brazil.","Service orders of $2 billion were up 3%, up 7% SFX and the orders price index was up 1.7%, sixth consecutive quarter of positive price for this business. We added $500 million to the backlog in Q3. Revenues of $3.7 billion were up 4%, up 11% SFX. And Equipment revenues of $1.9 billion were up 2%; Service revenues of $1.8 billion were up 6%. Segment profit of $534 million was up 18% driven by strong volume growth and lower-cost, which were partially offset by negative foreign exchange. And overall that resulted in 1.7 points of our profit expansion.","So another good quarter for the Energy and Oil and Gas and Energy Infrastructure in total and our current estimate for Energy Infrastructure segment is that profit growth will be about 10% for the total year 2012.","Next is Aviation. Orders of $5.2 billion were down 8%. Commercial Engine orders of $918 million were down 51%. When you have backlogs of two to seven years, depending on the engine model, we\u2019re going to have some quarters with tough comparisons. We also had over $500 million of Commercial Aviation order push-outs for two customers in Asia this quarter.","Military Equipment orders of $1.1 billion were up 104% driven by transports and Navy F-18 fighters. Service orders of $2.6 billion were down 11%. Our third quarter spares average daily order rate was $22 million per day which was down 18% versus last year, but it\u2019s up from the second quarter and it seems to have stabilized.","We continue to get pricing on new orders with total orders pricing up 2.3% in the quarter. Even with the tough order comparisons, overall book-to-bill was 1.09 with both Equipment and Service up over one. Revenue of $4.8 billion was down 1%. Equipment revenues of $2.3 billion and Service revenues of $2.4 billion were both down 1%. We shipped 520 commercial engines versus 565 last year. And in the quarter we shipped 25 GEnx units versus 28 last year.","Segment profit of $924 million was up 7% as the benefits of positive value GAAP and lower costs more than offset the impact of the one-time gain last year from the sale of our Rings business. The business improved operating margin rates 150 basis points in the quarter and if you exclude the impact of last year\u2019s gain, our profit would\u2019ve been up 17% and our profit rate would have been up 270 basis points.","Transportation. The Transportation business delivered another great quarter. Orders of $1.2 billion were up 21%. Orders pricing was up six-tenths of a percent. Equipment orders of $561 million up 28%, driven by higher international locomotive kits. And Service orders of $666 million were up 16%. Revenue of $1.4 billion was up 9% on strong volume. Equipment revenues of $781 million were up 5% driven by off-highway vehicle equipment, which was up 55%, partially offset by a lower locomotive revenues, which were down 13%.","We shipped 146 locomotives in the quarter versus 169 last year and we\u2019re on track for a total year estimate of 650 units. Service revenues of 627 million were up 16%. Segment profit of 265 million was up 35% driven by the positive value gap and also lower cost and our operating here increased 360 basis points in the quarter.","Next is Healthcare. The U.S. market was a little tougher than expected in the quarter. Orders of 4.6 billion were down 1%. They\u2019re up 3% ex-FX. Equipment orders of 2.6 billion were also down 1%, up 3% ex-FX driven by the developed markets down 5%, partially offset by the emerging markets, which were up 9%.","Just some of the numbers on orders, U.S. was down 6%, Europe was down 11% driven by Southern Europe. China was up 19%, Middle East Africa Eastern Europe were up 31%. India was down 17%.","By modality, CT was down 4%, MR was down 9%. Life Sciences was up 3% and ultrasound was up 1%.","Service orders of 2 billion were down 1% also driven by Europe down 12% and revenues of 4.3 billion were down 1% or were up three points FX adjusted. Emerging markets were the strength, here up 13% offsetting the developed markets, which were down 4%. Segment profit of 620 million was up 2% as the benefits of the volume growth in cost reductions more than offset lower pricing in some inflation. As a result operating profit rate was up 40 basis points in the quarter.","On the right side home and business solutions delivered positive results despite a continued tough environment. Revenues of 2.1 billion were up 1% as appliance revenues were up nine, offsetting the lighting revenues, which were down nine. For appliances we\u2019re seeing some contract channel strength. Contract channel revenues were up 22% driven by housing starts and retail sales were up 1%.","Pricing is up and year-to-date share is up about 1.1 points and the new products continue to be well received in the marketplace.","Lighting continue to see volume pressure in both the U.S. and Europe. And overall for the business segment profit of 61 million was up 61% driven by the higher pricing which was partially offset by material inflation and the lighting, lower lighting volume.","So next is GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team delivered a strong quarter. Revenues of $11.4 billion were down 5%, in line with assets, which were down 7%. Net income of $1.7 billion was up 11% driven by improvements in real estate as well as lower margin impairments, partially offset by higher credit costs and of course lower assets.","We ended the quarter with $425 billion of ending investment, a quarter ahead of our target and we expect any to continue to decline further in the fourth quarter. Our net interest margin was 4.9%, up 50 basis points. There are more details on GE capital and capital levels in the supplemental deck that we posted this morning.","On the right side you can see the asset quality metrics were stable in the quarter. 30-day delinquencies ere down in mortgage driven by improved collections and they were up our U.S. retail business driven by normal 3Q seasonality. Delinquencies were close to flat in both real estate and CLL.","Volume was up 2% driven by consumer volume up 5%. Commercial volume down 5% as we continue to originate the strong returns. Non-core ENI was down 6 billion in Q3 versus Q2. We\u2019re substantially done with our 2012 long-term funding, our capital position strengthened in the quarter and even after paying 5.4 billion of dividends we ended Q3 with Tier 1 common with 10.2% of 56 basis points.","For some comments by business I\u2019ll start with CLL. Commercial lending and leasing business assets were down 8% as we continue to reduce our non-core assets including third party funding for Penske and the CECO disposition. Commercial volume in the Americas of 7.2 billion was down 3% while we maintain our pricing on new business to earn over 2% return on investment.","Overall earnings of 568 million were down 17%. It\u2019s driven by lower assets, it\u2019s driven by one loss of 32 million loss on one account in Europe and it\u2019s driven by continued pressure in Italy about $20 million. Even with those items our European business earned over $40 million and the Americas earned $545 million, which was flat with last year and up 3% from the second quarter.","For consumer, our consumer assets were down 3%. It\u2019s driven by runoff in Europe and Asia, partially offset by growth in U.S. retail. Earnings of $749 million were down 7%, driven by higher retail reserves in the U.S. The impact to lower assets and our non-core business, partially offset by the 80 million gain we had from our selling our 7.6% of our whole stake in BAY, the bank in Thailand.","The U.S. retail business earned $445 million, which was down 4% as the benefits of higher assets and better margins were offset by the higher loss provisions due to additional segmentation of the portfolio more in line with industry standards.","Our core European business earned $119 million, which was down 3% on lower assets. For real estate, real estate continued to deliver positive performance in the quarter earnings of $217 million were up $300 million from last year. They were about flat with Q2. The earnings improvements was driven by lower losses and impairments, tax benefits, and higher core income. During Q3 we sold 165 properties for $1.7 billion realizing $121 million of after-tax gains, up $55 million from last year.","We continue to shrink our real estate book as well. Assets of $55 billion were down 14% versus last year. They\u2019re down 4% versus Q2. And in addition we closed the business properties disposition in October, which result in another $5 billion reduction in Q4.","Next is GECAS, GECAS had another great quarter. Earnings of $251 million were up 21% driven by higher core income. Partially offset by slightly higher impairments year-over-year. Net impairments this year were $135 million after tax versus $107 million last year. Portfolio quality continues to be strong with only $50 million of non-earnings and only three aircraft on the ground.","Energy Financial Service earnings of $152 million were up 67% driven by asset sales, $132 million driven by asset sales. We completed $600 million of volume in Q3 at 5% ROIC. So overall, another positive quarter for GE Capital. As we look at finishing the year we think the $1.7 billion net income from third quarter is a good proxy for the fourth quarter outlook. We expect lower GECAS impairments. We\u2019d expect to not have the BAY gain repeat. And we continue to have loss of earnings from shrinking assets ahead of schedule so that is our view for third quarter look at run rate into fourth quarter.","With that, let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Great, Keith. Thanks. Look, on the operating framework we really have no material changes for the 2012 operating framework. We are on track for double-digit earnings growth in total and for Industrial and Financial Services earnings. Our outlook for the Industrial segments remained in line with our September meeting.","You can see in the corporate cost line that our simplification efforts are working and sustainable and we are lower estimate for the year to $2.8 billion based on third quarter performance. CFOA is on track and industrial organic revenue growth has been about 10% year-to-date. We expect it to be about 10% for the year. We believe that capital revenue will decline about 10% based on the E&I reduction ahead of plan so total revenue for the entire company will be up about 3% in 2012.","So to summarize, let\u2019s recap the big factors for investors and how we performed against those objectives. Industrial earnings growth results remain positive. This is fueled by good organic growth and momentum in margin enhancement. And you know as I said earlier the simplification efforts really are generating results.","We\u2019re executing our plan with GE Capital making a smaller, more profitable, and restoring dividend to the parent. We have returned a $8.4 billion to investors year-to-date through dividend and buyback. We are executing a balance capital allocation plan of growing dividends in line with earnings, value-creating buybacks and bolt-on acquisitions in the $1 billion to $3 billion range. The GE team continues to execute in a volatile environment. We expect to continue to outperform in 2012 and 2013.","Now back to Trevor for questions.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great. Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Keith. Chanelle, why don\u2019t we open the phone lines for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Scott.","Keith Sherin","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","One of the things when we try to kind of model out margins and sustainable margin expansion going forward, I mean can you help us understand if there\u2019s any way to think about the 70 basis points? How much of that was value gap? How much of that is kind of from past restructuring? Any way to carve that up a bit?","Jeff Immelt","Sure. If you look in the third quarter, Scott, value gap was about $50 million drag actually in the quarter. That was two-tenths of a point of drag. Mix, equipment versus services and other mix, was about a half point of drag, 120 million or so. And cost out is the real driver here. It\u2019s over $500 million. It\u2019s 1.4 points of improvement and it\u2019s across the board. It\u2019s lower variable costs.","Its better base cost performance with this volume and it\u2019s simplification efforts are starting to kick in. So I think I don\u2019t have it relative to prior restructuring as you asked, but I think that\u2019s a good framework for the third quarter. It\u2019s great that the margins have turn positive here. And our expectation is that this margin improvement will continue in the fourth quarter and will increase obviously from the third quarter level to get us to our goal of the total year.","Keith Sherin","We still think value gap, Scott, will be positive for the year. It\u2019s been up more than $100 million year-to-date before Q3.","Jeff Immelt","So for the total year, it will be slightly positive.","Keith Sherin","So for the total year, it\u2019ll be positive and I expect it\u2019s going to be positive again in 2013 as well.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Jeff, going back to kind of your beginning remarks on the macro view, I mean, it seems that looking at some of the results from your peers that things have degraded a bit in the last couple months. I mean, when you\u2019re thinking about your planning scenarios for really 2013, because I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re in our process now, what are the \u2013 such a wide range of outcomes out there, I mean, what are you guys planning for? And how do you \u2013 and I don\u2019t know how you want to comment on it, whether you dial it down by region and what kind of GDP assumptions or whether you just want to talk about it more subjectively, but what do you plan for I guess?","Jeff Immelt","Well, Scott, I think you\u2019ve got to have a pretty \u2013 you\u2019ve got to factor in a number of different scenarios. I think most people are assuming that the fiscal cliff gets resolved in some way, and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re alone on that one. And then I think just when I look at orders in our growth regions, we\u2019ll have six growth regions that have double-digit orders growth for the year. Six of nine. That\u2019s pretty good, Scott. That\u2019s \u2013 that gives me some comfort when I look at the resource rich and rising Asia, and so we still see decent opportunities in China.","We still see decent opportunities in the Middle East and Latin America, Russia, places like that. And then Europe\u2019s going to be a grind. Europe\u2019s going to be \u2013 we\u2019re not assuming that Europe gets any better. So I think we\u2019re kind of looking at 2013 being kind of like 2012 with the big variable being the fiscal cliff and we\u2019re ready if it doesn\u2019t go through, but we\u2019re kind of making the same assessment most people do, that somehow it gets result.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Okay, Scott. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tusa, JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Energy Infrastructure, now I guess up 10% for the year. What was the expectation prior to this? It seems like that\u2019s \u2013 that the growth slows pretty materially in the fourth quarter. Is that timing around Wind or something like that?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, there\u2019s another obviously large chunk of revenue in of Wind in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s \u2013 it is a drag on us. I think that\u2019s probably the biggest factor for us. I mean, we still expect Energy to be up double-digit for the year. Year-to-date, they\u2019re up about 12% and for the total year, it\u2019ll be up 10% and they\u2019ll be up in the mid-single digits in the fourth quarter here for us.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Right. And so how does that kind of make you feel heading into next year, I guess outside of wind and the trends there? And also I guess you talked about orders pricing being up 8% year-to-date, but it\u2019s going to come in flat, which means you\u2019re going to have a pretty tough orders number, orders pricing number, in the fourth quarter. Does that change the views at all that you presented at the Investor Day several weeks ago?","Jeff Immelt","No, just to clear up this. It\u2019s 0.8% year-to-date through the third quarter and we\u2019re saying we expect it to be flat or slightly positive, so I \u2013 it\u2019s not a big change for the \u2013 there\u2019s no change in the fourth quarter, and that\u2019s our total year estimate that we stuck to, Steve. So no, I think if you go by business, you\u2019ve got to feel great about Oil and Gas. We continue to build backlog.","Our orders our strong. We had some orders slip even in the quarter. The outlook is very strong for next year as we head into the fourth quarter. For Energy itself, you feel great about the move to gas around the world. It\u2019s certainly helping us in terms of our service outlook and we\u2019ve got to continue to fight for every order they have been in the gas turbines side. We\u2019re going to have \u2013 we think we\u2019ll have growing megawatts of gas turbines sold in the outlook.","Keith Sherin","Yeah, Steve, at the end of September, we kind of said Power and Water would be up in 2012 and flat in 2013 and it would be up really double digits ex-Wind in 2013. I think we still that\u2019s true.","Jeff Immelt","True. That\u2019s the forecast.","Keith Sherin","We think Oil and Gas would be up double digits this year and next. We still think that\u2019s true. And we think Energy Management would be up double digits in 2012 and 2013, and we still think that\u2019s true. So I think it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we said at the infrastructure day.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. And then in Aviation, the service revenues were only down one but the service orders were down double digit. What\u2019s going on there and this timing around the price increase that pulled forward and some business last year. Can you maybe just talk about what you\u2019re seeing as things stabilized on the spare stuff or maybe just give a quick update there?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think spare\u2019s outlook seem to stabilize, going from the third quarter. In the second quarter the spare\u2019s rate was 20.6. In the third quarter it\u2019s 22. Our outlook in the fourth quarter is similar to that. So right now in the third quarter you\u2019re dealing with the biggest negative variance year-over-year and we\u2019re kind of laughing ourselves on that. Our expectation is that at some point revenue past your miles are still positive year-over-year. Freight is down slightly.","But at the end of the day, with all of these flights going on cycles occurring, there\u2019s going to be a pent-up demand for service here and we expect that to be positive for 2013. So in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re not counting on that. We\u2019re counting on the spares orders to be about where they are today and we think that will be a positive in 2013 as I said.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","All right, Steve.","Keith Sherin","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Nigel.","Keith Sherin","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yeah, so aviation margins just about the prior gain where we\u2019re obviously very strong, can you maybe talk about how the GEnx, you know, the learning curve on GEnx is impacting the comparisons?","Jeff Immelt","In the quarter, there\u2019s a couple factors going on around GEnx. First of all you have just a few lower units so that\u2019s a little bit positive year-over-year. We had 28 units last year, 25 this year. And then on a margin per unit, we continue to see good improvement. We\u2019re on track for our cost reductions as we come down the learning curve and the other thing is we\u2019re moving into better commercial arrangements as we get out of those launch orders for the GEnx shipments.","So I think it\u2019s on track. It\u2019s positive. In the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to have a big increase in shipments here and we\u2019re going to go up. The total year we\u2019re expecting somewhere around 125 shipments I think on GEnx engines so you\u2019re going to have \u2013 and in third quarter they\u2019re down a little. In the fourth quarter we\u2019re going to go from about 35 last year to close to 60 this year.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. But as the combination margins materially on the GEnx this last year?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think the learning curve is down substantially, Nigel, and what Keith said is that the original launch orders are usually the most negative from a CM rate to the combination of those two things I think builds every year. So that gets better in 2013.","Keith Sherin","You\u2019re probably seeing 10% improvement in margins year-over-year \u201811 to \u201812.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then switching to Thermal energy service, I think that was up 1%, what about that number being impacted by deferrals on some of their retro maintenance pedals because of the low gas price?","Jeff Immelt","If you look at the actual business in Q3 had revenue I think kick up 11 and earnings up 15 or something like that?","Keith Sherin","Yes. Service, PGS, Power Gen services.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. So the run rate is not \u2013 it\u2019s still a little bit lumpy but the run rate\u2019s not bad and then on the ongoing order rate was up 1% and we still think that some of those are really based on how hard the units are running and that unwinds itself. And then in Europe, we have a relatively big install base in Europe and that has to a certain extent the opposite issue. It\u2019s not running. But I think in the U.S., there\u2019ll be decent growth as time goes on.","Keith Sherin","I think the performance in the quarter, Power Gen services was...","Jeff Immelt","Pretty good.","Keith Sherin","15 was a pretty good quarter.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Right. And then just finally, you mentioned you called out a couple of order deferrals push out into 4Q. To what extent is that just normal lumpiness in the business into an extent you think that\u2019s been impacted by some concerns around the macro?","Jeff Immelt","Well, I just think you\u2019re always going to have some of that with the large orders we\u2019re dealing with. I mean there was really nothing on the Asia aviation orders other than just timing of approvals and it just didn\u2019t happen in the quarter that we originally estimated it.","I think that some of the oil and gas orders those involved a lot of parties with large engine energy contractors and government approvals and so I think that may be more typical that you\u2019re always going to have something pushing around but for us over $1 billion seem to really push out of the quarter. There were other orders that pushed that seemed like normal quarterly things for us but there were over 1 billion that we would\u2019ve called out as pushing out.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That\u2019s great. Take you very much.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Nigel.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks, and good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Steve.","Keith Sherin","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hey. Can I just switch over to GE Capital first. Just help me understand again, you mentioned the Thai gains, what other gains were in there and how much again was that Thai gain? And were there any other gains baked into the GE Capital reporting numbers as sort of a normal course of business?","Keith Sherin","Yeah, the Thai gain was $80 million from the sale of some of our shares in BAY. We also had the gains in real estate that I talked about from selling properties. And we had one other gain that was over $50 million in the quarter. It was the sale of the pipeline in EFS so in the EFS results that was the large driver of the earnings year-over-year.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Was that 15 or 50?","Keith Sherin","It\u2019s supposed to be the ones \u2013 58.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Oh, 58. Okay.","Keith Sherin","58, after-tax gain.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then was there \u2013 there wasn\u2019t anything \u2013 I had heard something about Irish mortgage bank there\u2019s nothing on that?","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have anything on Irish mortgage. I think it was closed. The deal that we previously announced.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. And then the consumer reserve I just saw it go up from $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. I\u2019m looking at the credit metrics you are showing in the supplemental, I\u2019m sorry, in the regular. I don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure I see the connection. Can you just give me some color for the overall increase in reserving and provisioning and what was driving some of that?","Jeff Immelt","Sure. As I mentioned on the reserves in Consumer, we did update the reserve practice for some more granular segmentation loss types. Essentially what we are doing is we\u2019re doing a more detailed look at to determine the period of time from the loss event to the write-off, the incurred loss period it\u2019s called. So we did some of that work in the third quarter. The incurred loss period was a little longer using that segmentation. It increased our reserves about $200 million in the U.S. Retail Finance business in the quarter.","Outside of that, we had the normal seasonality, which did contribute and we had asset growth, which contributed to reserve growth quarter-over-quarter and also year-over-year on asset growth. So if you look though in total assets were up 10 on retail finance, volumes up 10. The charge-off rate are down, Steve. They\u2019re down 24 basis points year-over-year, 36 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Delinquencies are down 36 points year-over-year. So the fundamentals of this business are still very good. It really is a detailed segmentation of the portfolio that added a couple hundred million dollars to the reserves as opposed to anything to do with asset quality","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And any impairments on GECAS?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah. In GECAS we had impairments. The total number is about 135 after tax in the quarter. I think in general I would say that some classic 737s were in there. Some A320s, old A320s, older A320s as well as 50-seat regional jets are probably the three things that would make up that number.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And last, let me just sneak in one industrial question. On the 29 gas turbines, what countries, and I know a gross number, any cancellations or deferrals of just the turbine side too?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, there were no cancellations in the quarter. In terms of where the turbines were, there were quite few from Saudi Arabia. Hang on one second here.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","I\u2019m mostly interested in the U.S.","Jeff Immelt","I have zero in the U.S. We had 5 in China, 8 in Saudi, 2 in Algeria, 2 in Turkey, 7 in Iraq, 2 in Egypt.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys","Jeff Immelt","Yep.","Keith Sherin","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Morning.","Keith Sherin","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question on GE Capital, as we look at ROI on new business, what\u2019s the sequential trend by business within GE Capital?","Jeff Immelt","Well, I will give you a few of them. If you look at the Americas for the Commercial business, second quarter was 2.4, third 2.3. If you look at Asia, and CLL, 1.9, 1.9. If you look at Asia consumer 3.6, 3.4. If you look at Europe CLL was 2.1 in the second quarter, it\u2019s 1.7 in the third quarter. If you look at retail for us in the U.S. 4.7 in the second quarter, 5.3. So overall, as I showed you, the net interest margins were up 50 basis points and our new business ROIs are still hanging in there on new business volume.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Sure. And just also on GE Capital, as you extract more capital out of GE Capital, what should we expect for the pace of share buybacks relative to what we saw the quarter?","Keith Sherin","Well, we like the buyback pace in the quarter over $2 billion, a little over $2 billion. Our objective as we said is to continue to prioritize the dividend and grow that in line with earnings. We continue to have that point, the buyback and our objective is to retire the shares that we shipped before the financial crisis over the next several years.","And we\u2019re doing a pretty good job on getting after that. And the cash from GE Capital obviously is a big help, so if we can continue to get the cash \u2013 although this year we\u2019ve already gotten all the special dividends, now we get the regular dividend on earnings. That\u2019s going to help us a lot with the buyback. And based on the market, we\u2019ll see what happens in the fourth quarter. We expect to retire somewhere between 125 and 150 million shares this year.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Keith Sherin","Yep.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi Research.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey, just a clarification first just on the headlines coming up about the revenue guidance, total revenue guidance going from 5% to 3%. So we already \u2013 you told us that GE Capital revenues are down, maybe there\u2019s some FX, but just if you could parse out for us what the delta is?","Jeff Immelt","That was the big\u2026","Keith Sherin","It\u2019s really GE Capital.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Okay. That...","Keith Sherin","And I don\u2019t know if anybody\u2019s really forecasting FX.","Jeff Immelt","Yeah.","Keith Sherin","Obviously FX had a big impact on us in the quarter; certainly industrially. But the change on the framework that we showed you was what Jeff said. The GE Capital total year revenue\u2019s going to be down closer to 10 than 5. And we would have thought that was worth updating.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Good. Just want to make sure because there\u2019s a couple of headlines out there and that clears that up. And then on the cash flow, you said there was some equipment build in the third quarter; that gets resolved. What\u2019s the business? And any color there regarding the size?","Keith Sherin","Sure. Obviously, we\u2019ve built up some working capital to support our fourth quarter shipments. You look at \u2013 it\u2019s mostly in energy. Energy\u2019s working capital bill was $1.3 billion through the third quarter. And we\u2019re expecting a big fourth quarter in terms of deliveries. If you look at the profile last year third quarter to fourth quarter, we had a big revenue increase between the quarters. We also had a significant increase in cash flow between third quarter and fourth quarter. Fourth quarter will be our biggest cash flow period for the year. And we\u2019re expecting a profile similar to last year; a little higher than last year in terms of cash coming out of Industrial in the fourth quarter.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","And progress on the red assets at GE Capital?","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have a specific number. I know in total we\u2019re down about $6 billion. How much? $6 billion on quarter-over-quarter. Yeah. There\u2019s about $70 billion on balance sheet today on the red assets. So in the quarter, we felt great about it. You look at the runoff we had. I can just give you some numbers on some things that are down year-over-year. U.K. Home Lending\u2019s down $1 billion Deane, France is down $1.5 billion, Poland\u2019s down $1.3 billion, Spain\u2019s down $1 billion. Those are all non-core assets that we\u2019re running off here in a pretty good pace.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Great. Just last question from me is maybe some commentary regarding the debt issue for the parent because that certainly doesn\u2019t happen often and it\u2019s never a better time to issue debt when you don\u2019t really need the financing. But just give us a context of $7 billion; you did it in three consoles use of that proceeds?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, it kind of goes back to the first question about what you think about the environment. I mean as we look forward, we have a $5 billion debt in GE that matures February and so we decided that we really didn\u2019t want to be trying to replace that debt in an environment where the fiscal cliff may be a disruptor or not. So we decided to go in the fourth quarter. We like the rates.","As you said, we did $7 billion. We\u2019ll have a big-interest savings if you look on that debt. We\u2019ll probably have annual savings around $70 million at the rates that we did that debt at with a mix of 5, 10 and 30 years as you know. So we decided to get that out of the way. We know we have to do; we didn\u2019t want to do it in a disrupted environment. We like the rates where they are. It creates a savings for us. Now we do have a little higher interest cost in the fourth quarter because of that, but for us it just seems like the right thing to do.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","That\u2019s real helpful. Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","Deane? Deane, are you clear on the revenue point?","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Absolutely.","Jeff Immelt","I just want it clear to everybody. Good.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citi Research","Yeah, appreciate it. Thanks.","Keith Sherin","Great.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, John good morning.","Keith Sherin","John.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Hi, guys. Keith, maybe a question for you. It\u2019s really on the buffet and warrants. With your stock price sort of where it is, I\u2019m wondering what are you thinking of in terms of possibly, maybe buying them in advance? And if you don\u2019t do that is very dilutionary impact kind of on a net basis of this that provides for headwind that maybe we should be thinking about?","Keith Sherin","Yeah, John, if you think about it, the dilution is on amounts above $22.25.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Right.","Keith Sherin","And it\u2019s de minimis. We\u2019d love to have the stock to go up to $25.25. That would be less than $400 million of dilution. I think its 135 million shares that you\u2019re talking about the dilution on. So I\u2019m thrilled that we\u2019re in the money on them. And yet we\u2019re going to have to deal with the dilution, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big deal for investors.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. That clears that up. With zero U.S. gas turbine orders, can you just remind us, what is your sort of latest thought toward the timing of a U.S. gas turbine cycle recovery? Years and maybe you could blend that in with them with a little bit of pricing kind of what you are seeing on the pricing side that sort of thing?","Jeff Immelt","John, I would just go back to what Steve basically said in September. We think there is activity right now that\u2019s going on that\u2019ll turn into commitments next year. So I think as you go into 2013 and into 2014, those commitments will go into orders. And I think that pace will grow as each year goes by. So we\u2019re seeing quoting activity right now. We expect to book some orders next year and we think that\u2019ll grow over time. I think the good news is that gas is the fuel of choice, and as new capacity comes in, it\u2019s going to be gas turbines.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So if the trajectory holds, presumably the price though, doesn\u2019t start to meaningfully kick in until what, 2014? If the timeline...","Jeff Immelt","Look, I think the good news, John, is that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve been kind of firming a bottom right now. So I think you could see some positive OPI into 2013, not great, but some positive, just because I think we\u2019ve been trying for the last period of time. So I think that will start improving and then I think it accelerate as time goes on.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Just lastly, Jeff, with the cash and the cash position in pretty robust shape, what are your thoughts toward maybe upping your M&A spend targets? Just even given the macro sluggish environment that might be perhaps prompting more companies to consider selling or make more properties available. What are your thoughts here?","Keith Sherin","I go back, John, to our disciplines. I think dividend in line with earnings. We think the dividend is really important. Continuing to buy back stock with an eye on getting back to 10 billion shares at some point and the $1 billion to $3 billion. So if we see a good acquisition in that range that meets our hurdle rates, we\u2019ll go for it. But it\u2019s not burning a hole in our pocket and we don\u2019t think we need it to do what we need to do in 2013.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much.","Keith Sherin","Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, John.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Hey. So just back on the re-segmentation of the U.S. retail business, what was the thought process behind making that choice? And then the extra provision in the quarter, was that a sort of the catch-up? Or what\u2019s the sort of normalized annual hit to earnings relative to the way you used to segment it?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think we\u2019re going through a process in the retail finance business to take a look at our reserve practices and our segmentation relative to industry standards. In the quarter, we did a couple of factors. We did aged accounts and we did fraudulent accounts. I mean, we\u2019re basically trying to identify individual events and then go back and say how long is the incurred loss period for that type of event? And there will be \u2013 there are other categories we\u2019re still looking at: if people pass away, if people reach settlements, if people have bankruptcies.","So we\u2019re basically trying to segment that book into very detailed and more conservative, realistically more conservative, look at reserve positions based on when the incurred loss period actually started. So I think in the quarter, there\u2019s no more to come from those categories. I think we\u2019re going to continue to look at these other categories. To us, we\u2019re just trying to make sure that we\u2019re in line with industry practices and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to do through fourth quarter and first quarter I believe.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. Any so any estimate of sort of what the more conservative method is in terms of a dollar amount on the earnings impact for a year?","Jeff Immelt","I don\u2019t. I\u2019d say the one thing I\u2019d look at is if I think about the outlook from third quarter to fourth quarter, I think retail finance probably has an outlook that\u2019s similar in the fourth quarter to what they had the third quarter.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay.","Jeff Immelt","Even though they\u2019ve had this one-time thing, I think if you look at the outlook, it\u2019s probably going to be \u2013 based on volume growth and based on whatever we\u2019re doing with reserves, our outlook is probably close to what we had in the third quarter.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. And then just Energy into 4Q, I mean, can you give us a little more feel on the number of sort of wind turbine units and the pressure you\u2019re expecting? I mean, the margin this quarter was like 13.6% for sort of the pure Energy business. You normally have this seasonal uptick, but you\u2019ve got this pressure. Can you maybe gauge where you see those going?","Jeff Immelt","I gave you the total number, if the total year\u2019s going to be up 10%, you look at where we are third quarter to date, I think you can get a pretty good estimate of what we think the margin is for Energy for the fourth quarter. I don\u2019t have the exact dollars but that math\u2019s pretty clear.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","And what are you thinking for wind turbine units?","Jeff Immelt","It\u2019s 750 or so units.","Keith Sherin","It\u2019s 700, yeah.","Jeff Immelt","So 750 or so units.","Keith Sherin","Yeah.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan \u2013 Nomura","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Good morning, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Hi. How are you doing?","Jeff Immelt","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Good morning. Thanks. I just want to drill a little farther into power service if we could. Just some color on what you are actually seeing your customers do? So you\u2019re running at higher utilization, I wonder if there\u2019s some dynamic though that we are running more base load as opposed to kind of the peaking cycles and that\u2019s \u2013 is that playing into what seems to be softer order there than I guess we would all guess given kind of the trends in the business right now?","Jeff Immelt","I think you heard from some of this from Steve Bowles in the infrastructure meeting, Jeff. You know basically you\u2019re absolutely right. I mean people are running the gas turbines a lot more and they are running them as base load. And that is ultimately good news and I think the idea is going to be you\u2019re going to have either sooner maintenance needs or maybe there will be a little deeper overhaul when you get into repair these units when they do have an overhaul.","But Steve\u2019s message was that these were going to pull in, running these things at full base load power at this point is maybe pulling overhauls by three months, six months in the out years. These overhauls are pretty well scheduled based on times the units will run. So I think it is a positive. I think it\u2019s all positive. But I think it\u2019s a little further out there but right now they are definitely running gas turbine units a lot more on the running of this baseload.","Keith Sherin","Jeff, we said I think in September that we expected good earnings growth from Power Gen services in 2013 and we don\u2019t see anything that changes that assessment.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yeah, I thought the comment actually was flattish for 2013 on services, no?","Jeff Immelt","Flattish overall for the Power and Water business.","Keith Sherin","Yeah flattish for the Power and Water business, but for services we expect growth. We expect wind to be negative.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","As we get closer to the wind down turn is it actually playing in a way you thought in terms of the magnitude of drop next year?","Keith Sherin","Jeff, it is. I think we expect revenues will be down, probably 40% something like that next year and we have always said that it would be about $0.03 of headwind next year. And that really assumes kind of no market in the US. There is some discussion about whether or not there is a production tax credit as you do some kind of tax deal at the end of the year. And if there is one I think that would be good for the business but it\u2019s not something we are counting on.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","And then finally, just thinking about cash flow, I mean it does look like a challenge in Q4. The idea of the working capital draws is understandable. But does that cash flow forecast does it also predicated on particular order strength in the fourth quarter that would drive deposits or progress payments? Is that any part of it?","Jeff Immelt","Not really, Jeff. I think progress remains a headwind. It\u2019s an unusual year just because the spike in wind and stuff like that so this is just been an unusual year from that standpoint. But we see the working capital levers for cash...","Keith Sherin","They\u2019re pretty similar profile to last year the fourth quarter. I think the one difference is you have the wind progress coming down and we factored that in, Jeff. We don\u2019t have any replenishment in the wind progress in the forecast and basically we are shipping that in the fourth quarter. So I think we take that into account but it\u2019s a big fourth quarter and we have to execute.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right. Thank you very much.","Jeff Immelt","Yep.","Keith Sherin","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Jeff Immelt","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi.","Jeff Immelt","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Good morning. Firstly, on Aviation, I wanted to follow-up on your comments around some push-outs at some Asian carriers. And also, in the segment profit growth, I mean you call out the value gas and productivity driving up EBIT year-on-year. I just wanted to check what the latest thoughts were on R&D, you know around the headwinds there in light of the Leap 1a and 1b designs being frozen. Are you still on track for R&D to stop moving flat to down in 2013?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, we are on track for the R&D. If you look at the margins in the quarter, stronger pricing was a big part of it and cost productivity with the other part that aviation got and we expect those two factors to continue. If you look at R&D and Aviation itself, it was up about, it was down about 7% and it\u2019s holding steady around 5% of revenue. So as a percent of revenue as we said we don\u2019t expect this to continue to be a drag. We\u2019ll see what happens as we get into 2013 but we like the position we are in those engines. We\u2019ve gone to design freeze on two of the three versions of LEAP and we\u2019re on track for the design freeze on schedule for the third version.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Thanks. Just the comments around some of the push outs on the OE parts?","Jeff Immelt","The push outs? Yes.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes.","Keith Sherin","Yeah, it\u2019s purely \u2013 my understanding of it is purely a signature approval and it\u2019s not someone wondering whether they\u2019re going to take these planes. So we\u2019re highly confident that these orders are going to happen in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s two customers and it\u2019s about $500 million now. Again if you remember last year in the fourth quarter I think equipment was up 20 plus percent.","Jeff Immelt","We had huge orders quarter.","Keith Sherin","Huge order quarter in aviation so, yeah again, with these backlogs we\u2019re going to have that type of lumpiness but these orders it\u2019s not like someone worrying about their fleet planning or anything.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Got it. And then just second on healthcare, the picture of the past 12 months has been very good growth in emerging markets, Europe very weak, in the U.S. kind of hanging on. Looking at the U.S. equipment order trends last couple quarters, I mean is there \u2013 are you worried about starting to rollover? I mean maybe six months from now the numbers are looking down kind of high single digit that sort of rate as you\u2019re looking at U.S. healthcare specifically?","Jeff Immelt","I don\u2019t see that, Julian. I think it\u2019s around flat and it\u2019s going to continue to be around flat and there\u2019s nothing that our guys see that suggest it\u2019s getting materially worse as time goes on. I just think it\u2019s a tough market but it\u2019s not like Europe.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","Yup.","Keith Sherin","Great. Chanelle, we have \u2013 I want to finish up by 9:30 because of some other earnings calls. Let\u2019s take a couple more than close out.","Operator","Will do. Our next question comes from Jason Feldman with UBS.","Jason Feldman \u2013 UBS","Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hi, Jason.","Jason Feldman \u2013 UBS","Just wanted to follow-up on the aviation aftermarket. You talked about expectation of improvement next year. Wondering if you have any sense of what kind of impact you had this year from the earlier and normal retirements of younger planes, the cannibalization for parts and whether you expect that to continue or whether you\u2019ve really haven\u2019t seen much of that?","Jeff Immelt","That\u2019s been part of our run rate and analysis for the business already to take a look at where new serviceable parts going to come from. I think the biggest impact that we\u2019ve had this year really has been on the wide-body. It\u2019s the CF6 is down. It\u2019s down by overhauls and freights and it\u2019s really a maintenance pressure on us while this CFM products and the GE90 products are both up so on the more prevalent install base narrow body growth that we\u2019ve had you starting to see those engines come in for overhaul.","Certainly the GE90 and the 777 you\u2019re seeing those engines coming for overhaul and we\u2019re just seeing a push out. I think a lot of its freight. I think some of it are in Europe and some of the older applications that CF6 is on and we\u2019re really having to deal with that more than cannibalization on the narrow body product.","Jason Feldman \u2013 UBS","Okay. Thanks. And briefly on capital, we\u2019ve heard a lot this earning season about CapEx kind of being pushed out. You certainly alluded to the fiscal cliff and whatnot. Have you seen any impact on CLL loan demand or is there still efficiently few competitors that you\u2019re still able to originate as much as you want there?","Jeff Immelt","We said the commercial volume is down about 5%. I think the bigger part of that is it\u2019s uncertainty. It\u2019s people not willing to spend because they have a more certain environment around whether it\u2019s taxes or healthcare or social cost or things like that and just the general backdrop in terms of confidence so I think we have seen some of that. We are seeing nice volume on the equipment side in the CLL business but on the CapEx side I\u2019d say that\u2019s been soft.","Keith Sherin","Soft, yeah.","Jason Feldman \u2013 UBS","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","Next.","Operator","And our final question comes from Brian Langenberg with Langenberg Investments.","Brian Langenberg \u2013 Langenberg Investments","Hi, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Langenberg \u2013 Langenberg Investments","Good morning. About the 300 million of restructuring you did, can you just layer that around the segments like how much impact there was in each of the industrial segments?","Jeff Immelt","Sure. If you look at it by business, I will give you after tax numbers. Energy was 50. Healthcare was 27. GE Capital is 25. HNBS was 17. Aviation was 16. And about 100 was associated with the planned exit.","Brian Langenberg \u2013 Langenberg Investments","Okay, great, all right. I will follow up for later but thank you very much.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Just before we wrap up I want to give some thoughts about the company going forward. With all the volatility in the environment I think our Aviation business, we\u2019re winning in the marketplace with a massive backlog. Oil and Gas is a fast-growth market with a lot of opportunity for expansion. I think our Power and Water business is really well-positioned for a gas cycle.","Healthcare remains a diagnostic leader with a great growth market foundation. Our Transportation business is well-positioned for growth based on new technology and global expansion. Energy Management has room to grow. And our Consumer businesses will benefit from an improving housing cycle.","GE Capital is smaller, stronger and more competitive. And we\u2019re operating the company well with large backlogs, I think, successful acquisitions, expanding margins and substantial cash. So from an investor standpoint, while the environment is volatile, I think our path for growth and execution is very well understood by the team. And we think this quarter demonstrates that and we think we feel good about how we\u2019re positioned for the fourth quarter and 2013. So Trevor thanks, and have a good day.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great. Thanks, Jeff, a couple of items just to close out the day. A replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Good morning and thanks for joining our second quarter earnings call. Today I'm joined by: our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our CFO, Jeff Bornstein; and GE Aviation President and CEO David Joyce. Earlier today, we posted a press release, presentation, and supplemental on our Investor website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","Now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. I would describe our markets in two segments really. The resource sector remains tough, putting pressure on our Oil & Gas and Transportation businesses. Meanwhile, the rest of our markets have plenty of growth available. The strength of GE is our diversity, and we remain on track for our 2016 framework and our bridge to 2018.","In the second quarter, our portfolio execution was a real highlight. This includes GE Capital de-designation, the Appliances sale with a substantial gain, and the sale of GE Asset Management.","From an operations standpoint, we had EPS of $0.51, and that is growth of 65%. Industrial EPS was up 35% excluding gains and restructuring. Margins were flat ex-Alstom and up 10 basis points year to date, and we're on track for our margin goals for the year. Alstom was $0.01 of share in the second quarter, and we're on track to hit our plan in 2016. CFOA was $10.7 billion, and we're on track for our CFOA goals for the year.","Industrial operating profit and organic revenue growth were down slightly in the first half, consistent with our expectations. However, we are positioned for strong organic growth in the second half. And we were able to hit our earnings goals despite a $0.03 headwind in foreign exchange year to date.","Looking forward, we have no change to our framework for the year. We still expect organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%, with strong organic growth in the second half. We expect margins to expand and Alstom to deliver $0.05 a share. We still expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be $29 billion to $32 billion for the year, including a capital dividend of $18 billion.","Year to date we've returned $18 billion to investors, and we're on track for $26 billion in the year. So despite the macro volatility, we are delivering.","Orders were $27 billion, down 2%, down 16% organically. Alstom orders were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $7.5 billion for the first half. Backlog grew by $4 billion from the first quarter of 2016 and sit at $320 billion, a record. Core service backlog grew by 11%. Orders pricing was down slightly versus a year ago. Power and Aviation pricing was positive, but Oil & Gas continues to be pressured. Equipment orders were down 11%, which was 30% organically. We saw sustained pressure in Oil & Gas and Transportation, while Power and Aviation had tough comps versus a year ago.","There were a few highlights. Aviation had another excellent airshow with more than $25 billion in commitments, and we have 34 H turbines in backlog. Total service orders were up 9%, with solid growth in Aviation and Renewables. Globally, the wind markets are strong, and we expect solid growth for the year.","Our pipeline of activity in Oil & Gas is improving, and we're working on several large global loco [locomotive] deals to offset sluggishness in the U.S. Our global orders are $31 billion year to date, about flat versus a year ago, including Alstom. We've increased Alstom backlog about by about $2 billion since the acquisition. Digital orders ex-AGP were up 15% in the second quarter, with revenue up 17%. AGP revenue was up 2% and orders were down. We expect 50% growth in AGPs in the second half. We now have 54 partners and 12,000 developers, which is ahead of plan.","Recently, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to put Predix in Azure and with Huawei to expand in China. In addition, we launched major customer collaborations with Schindler, PSEG, and the city of Tianjin. We're on track to hit $7 billion in digital orders this year.","In the second half we export orders to be about flat. Service orders will be up and equipment will be down slightly. And on balance orders are coming in about where we expected.","I wanted to give you a little bit more context for revenue since our plan is back-end loaded. In the first half, organic revenue was down 1%. We expect the second half will strengthen, to be up about 5%. We see organic growth at 2% to 4% for 2016, likely trending close to the bottom end of the range.","There are three main dynamics. Oil & Gas faces major cyclical headwinds, but by the second half they have easier comps. We have line of sight to several big projects in the second half, which will help build backlog for 2017. Power is shipping 65% of its gas turbine volume in the second half, including 50% more AGPs than last year, and most of these units are in backlog. The rest of the company is sustaining organic growth in the 5% range, comparable to the run rate, and this should continue in the second half.","We have several businesses that have sustained strong organic growth rates in the first half. Healthcare is improving, with Life Sciences up 12%, China is up 19%, and ultrasound is up 9%. Renewables grew by 27%, and Services grew by 5% with momentum in Power and Aviation. Including Alstom, global revenue grew by 12% in the quarter, including significant growth in Europe, India, Africa, and ASEAN. Bottom line, we're seeing organic growth accelerating in the second half.","Margins are trending consistent with our expectations. Excluding foreign exchange, core margins were up 40 basis points in total and with segment gross margins also at 40 basis points. We're making great progress on value gap and cost productivity. We expect this to improve in the second half. Service margins are 90 basis points year to date excluding Alstom.","Next an update on our Alstom execution, as I mentioned earlier, we remain on track for $0.05 a share in 2016, and we're on track for $1.1 billion in synergies for the year. We're seeing significant benefits, including coordinated technical and cost performance on gas turbines, the system performance is exceeding our expectations, and Alstom equipment backlog in Power is up 22%. This improved market acceptance for GE in the Grid and steam turbine business. Our customers see these as good fits for GE, and we're winning incremental business. As expected, we're seeing strong cost execution in sourcing and plant restructuring. Services integration in Power is ahead of plan. We see significant opportunities for upgrades in coal to improve energy efficiency.","So we really expect to see favorability in Alstom revenue synergies that we didn't count on when we did the deal. We see Alstom favorably so far and expect this momentum to continue. So we have a lot going on with the integration of Alstom, but the team is doing well.","Our cash performance was good overall, but our Industrial cash performance was impacted by a range of issues and trailed our expectations. Capital dividends are now $15 billion, on track for their $18 billion goal, including another $4 billion this week.","We face several CFOA headwinds in the first half that should unwind during the year. We have a large inventory build behind new NPI with LEAP, H, and wind products. These are all shipping in the second half. Alstom exacerbates our profile as their earnings, synergies, and tax benefits are also back-half loaded. We still expect Alstom to be a neutral on cash for the year. We expect earnings to accelerate in the second half, with substantial improvement in working capital. And finally, we had about $1 billion of comp and tax payments in the first half that won't repeat.","We've returned $18 billion to investors in the first half through buyback and dividends and are on track for $26 billion for the year. Free cash flow is a big metric on the company comp plans and the team is incented to hit these goals.","Now I want to introduce David Joyce, who will give you an update on our great Aviation business and our wins at Farnborough.","David L. Joyce - Senior Vice President; President & CEO-GE Aviation","Thanks, Jeff. Let me start with a quick perspective on our performance over the last three years.","Aviation has been a strong segment for GE, with good leverage, annual growth rate and operating profit of 13% on 6% growth in revenue. Over that same period, we've been investing in the next generation of products and technologies, growing our installed base of engines and service, positioning our supply chain and business for the transition in new products, building our digital services for both GE and our customers, while strengthening our operating profit of the business by 250 basis points. Performance has been very consistent with our strategic imperatives.","And as we look at 2016, we see another strong year, led by the commercial environment, which is depicted on the next page: traffic growth estimated at just over 6% after growth of almost 7.5% in 2015; freight traffic estimated to grow again in 2016; over 2 million departures added in the last year, with very healthy airplane load factors across the networks at 80% for the second year in a row; and jet fuel cost, which is largest variable cost for our airline customers, estimated to be deflationary again in 2016. If you look at the trend in jet fuel over the last three years, it's down almost 50%. And all of these factors fuel profits in the industry, estimated to grow again in 2016.","Now switching over to the defense environment, U.S. defense spending is anticipated to be flat in 2017. However, we see an increase in science and technology spending as well as operations and maintenance. Additionally, international defense spending is growing, anticipated to be up 4% across the globe excluding the U.S.","At Aviation, we're experiencing growth in our military spares sales, 9% in 2015 and 6% through the first half of this year. And we forecast our installed base growth to be 14.5% by 2020.","2016 has been a busy year in the military segment with some terrific wins. Just last month we were awarded the $1 billion contract to develop the next-generation fighter engine with our Adaptive Cycle technology, combining high efficiency with high performance situationally. This technology promises 25% improvement in fuel efficiency, 30% in range, and up to 20% more thrust relative to today's most advanced engines.","We were also chosen to power the Korean indigenous fighter and re-engine the UK Apaches. We're growing our services contracts with all three military branches, including the F110 overhaul service work with the Air Force that was awarded to us earlier. And we're delivering on some very important milestones in support of the new Saab Gripen, powered by our F414, and the CH-53 King Stallion, powered by our new heavy-lift helicopter engine, the P408.","So the impact of both the commercial and military environments on our Aviation business has resulted in an unprecedented backlog totaling $156 billion, up $46 billion in the last three years. Focusing on the critical pieces of that backlog story: equipment up 11% CAGR over the last three years, thanks to the successful launch of our new products; services up 13% CAGR over the same time period, enabling us to fund the product transition.","Last week was a terrific Farnborough Air Show for GE Aviation: $25.9 billion of business in total at list price, over 800 new engine commitments, and we surpassed 30,000 CFM engines produced. At the same time, we have surpassed 11,000 LEAP engines committed.","So let's talk LEAP, terrific product positioning, sole source on the 737 MAX, on the COMAC C919 and over a 50% win rate on the A320neo. We delivered our first LEAP-powered A320neo to Pegasus on Tuesday, entering service this weekend. We're forecasting to deliver 110 engines this year, building to 1,900 by 2019.","This year we also reached record levels of delivery on our current CFM engines, exceeding 1,700 engines. My point is that the rates for LEAP are not uncharted territory for CFM, and we're very confident in our plan to deliver on time.","Now switching to margins, of course, this transition investment is dilutive as we march down our learning curve and deliver on launch orders, but we have some big tailwinds that allow us to maintain margin rates through the transition. First is our services growth, 44,000 installed commercial engines by 2020. Over 61% of our entire installed fleet has seen one shop visit or less. Second, lower company-funded research and development, we've completed certification on our Passport engine, our GE Honda engine, and the LEAP engines for both Airbus and Boeing, and we'll complete the C919 LEAP engine cert in fourth quarter of this year.","And finally, our digital productivity; in both services as we improve time on wing and cost per shop visit on the $122 billion backlog and in operations accelerating our variable cost productivity and LEAP learning curve. Only GE has the strength of its installed base to support this magnitude of product transformation, creating both the next generation of our installed base and service while delivering for our shareholders today.","So let me finish with a look at GE Aviation as a digital industrial business, first, the impact for our customers transitioning to predictive maintenance on 35,000 engines. So far, we've experienced a 25% improvement in unscheduled disruptions for those customers engaged in our digital programs. As an example, Emirates, a big, big, GE Aviation customer, has realized for the first six months of 2016 a 43% reduction in disruptions and a reduction in planned maintenance, resulting in 12 additional days of utilization across their fleet of 777s for the first half of this year.","For our business, it's all about productivity. In engineering, we have the most sophisticated turbine blade designs on test in two weeks versus nine months. We've launched 13 brilliant factories where operations data connected to our data lake is available to critical experts across the business in engineering, supply chain, and services, resulting in 0.5-point improvement in variable cost productivity year to date.","At the enterprise level, our new advanced turbo prop has eliminated 845 parts, using digital design tools coupled with additive manufacturing, eliminating engineering hours, drawings, purchasing activities, quality plans, shipping, assembly hours, and ultimately reducing costs while improving speed and quality. We're just beginning to understand the value of a digital industrial GE Aviation and the impact on the customers and our operational productivity.","And with that, I'd like it to turn it over to Jeff Bornstein.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, David.","I'll start with the second quarter summary. Revenues were $33.5 billion, up 15% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 16% to $30.7 billion. You can see on the right side that the Industrial segments were up 7% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion.","Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. The operating EPS number of $0.39 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I'll cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.36 includes the impact of non-operating pension. The net EPS of $0.30 includes discontinued operations. The total disc-ops impact was a charge of $544 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs.","As Jeff said, we generated $10.7 billion of CFOA in the half, up from $3.9 billion last year, driven by the increased dividend from GE Capital.","Industrial CFOA was $400 million for the half, down 89%. This was driven by a number of known items, including our three-year long-term incentive program payout, non-repeat of last year's NBC settlement, negative Alstom CFOA in the quarter, and timing on our service billings. While we planned to be down in the first half, we underperformed our own expectations by roughly $1 billion, driven by lower collections, accelerated inventory build, and earlier closing of Appliances transaction in the quarter than we originally planned.","Fortunately, most of this is timing between the first half and the second half. In the second half, we are planning for income plus depreciation and amortization of around $8 billion, working capital improvement of $3 billion to $4 billion, driven by second half shipments and improvement in AR performance, particularly delinquency, and other timing items such as tax of $1 billion to $2 billion. That walks you to the total framework of $12 billion to $14 billion of Industrial CFOA, no change to our framework for the year.","In addition, in the second quarter GE borrowed $5 billion from GE Capital, which will mature in the fourth quarter of this year. This makes a ton of sense for the company as we already own the excess debt and the borrowing cost is lower than our dividend yield. The proceeds were used for an accelerated share repurchase program launched in June. This helps accelerate our buyback within the year.","The GE tax rate was 15% and the GE Capital tax rate was 27%, which for the GE Capital tax rate reflects a benefit on a pre-tax continuing loss. For the year, we expect the GE rate to be in the mid-teens.","On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 7% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $148 million was a one-point headwind, and lost revenue from disposition was a four-point impact. Each of those impacts were more than offset by a 12-point revenue increase from Alstom.","Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and 6% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of $13 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional $120 million of FX transactional impacts, which is not adjusted for in the organic calculation. This is related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges, principally in the Oil & Gas, Renewables, and Power segments.","Including corporate operating costs, Industrial op profit was down 2% reported and down 4% organically. As you see at the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.51, up 65%. That includes $0.11 of gains net of restructuring this year versus zero a year ago. In the box we provided the V% adjusted for industrial gains and restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, Industrial operating EPS was up 35%, and total Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was up 29%.","Next I'll talk about one-time items. We had $0.09 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $1.2 billion on a pre-tax basis, with about $400 million related to Oil & Gas and $300 million related to Alstom synergy investments and accounting items. The $0.09 was a little bit lower than what we were estimating, driven by timing of restructuring projects. As you know, the Appliance deal closed in the quarter, contributing about $0.20 of gain.","At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We continue to expect gains in restructuring to offset for the year. In the third quarter, we have the Asset Management disposition and some smaller transactions in the fourth quarter that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25.","Next I'll cover each of the segments, starting with the Power business. Orders in the quarter totaled $7.7 billion, up 41%. Excluding Alstom orders of $2.9 billion, core orders were down 11%, with equipment down 26%, and services lower by 4%. Core equipment orders were lower primarily due to units mixing to smaller aero and steam units, partially offset by four additional H orders year over year. Total gas turbine orders were 16 units versus 18 a year ago. Through the half, core equipment orders are up 1%, with heavy-duty frames up 25%.","Core equipment backlog excluding Alstom grew 37% year over year to $8.3 billion, driven by H technology strength. Our H backlog stands at 34 units inclusive of five new orders, offset by six unit shipments.","Service orders excluding Alstom were down 4% on lower AGPs of 24 versus 39 last year and lower aero services. Through the first half, AGP orders totaled 49 versus 55 last year. For the total year, we remain on plan for 135 to 150 AGPs versus 119 a year ago.","Through the half, total upgrades grew 18% to 153 versus 130 units a year ago, driven by Dry Low NOx, compressor upgrades, and flange-to-flange upgrades. Year to date, total service orders grew 2%, led by Power Services up 5%. Service backlog excluding Alstom ended the quarter at $54.3 billion, which is up 5% versus prior year.","Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.9 billion, including $1.7 billion of equipment orders. In the second quarter we took an order for the Hassyan super-critical steam coal plant in Dubai as well as orders for five more HRSGs [Heat Recovery Steam Generator]. The Alstom equipment backlog is up 22% since we closed the acquisition in the Power Systems business. Alstom service orders of $1.1 billion included eight steam upgrades. Alstom service backlog ended the quarter at $9.8 billion.","Power revenue in the second quarter totaled $6.6 billion, up 31%. Excluding Alstom, core revenues of $5.2 billion grew 2%, with equipment revenue down 5% on lower BOP associated with last year's large Egypt equipment deal, partially offset by higher H shipments. We shipped 26 gas turbines versus 24 last year, including six H units. Service revenues excluding Alstom grew 7%, driven by Power Services up 12%. We shipped 28 AGPs versus 26 a year ago. Alstom revenue of $1.5 billion included $600 million of equipment and $900 million of services.","Operating profit was higher by 9% in the quarter. Excluding Alstom, core op profit of $1.1 billion was up slightly on positive value gap and cost-out, partially offset by H mix. Margins on the six H shipments were roughly breakeven, and we expect shipments to be margin-positive beginning in the third quarter. Margin rates excluding Alstom contracted 40 basis points. Alstom earned $89 million of op profit in the quarter and was higher than planned on better synergy execution.","We continue to see strong demand for the H technology. Our cost position continues to improve on the H, and we expect to have positive margins in the third quarter on the platform. We're also pulling through Alstom technology, including steam units, generators, and HRSGs. We're on track to ship about 115 gas turbines for the year, with a heavy fourth quarter. The Alstom integration is also on track, and the business will deliver about $800 million of synergies or better for the year.","Next on Renewables, orders in the quarter of $2 billion were down 6%. Orders through the first half grew 29%. The business took orders for 637 wind turbines in the quarter versus 888 wind turbines in the second quarter of last year. For the first half, core orders excluding Alstom for wind were higher by 15%. Two-thirds of the turbines ordered were for our new two-megawatt and three-megawatt machines. In addition, we booked orders for 218 wind turbine upgrades. Alstom orders in the quarter were $206 million.","Backlog finished the quarter at $12.6 billion, including $5.1 billion associated with Alstom. GE core backlog grew 26% versus the second quarter of 2015. Revenues in the quarter grew 28% to $2.1 billion, with core GE revenue up 14%. We shipped 856 wind turbines versus 806 last year. Alstom contributed $221 million of revenue.","Operating profit of $128 million was down 11% year over year. GE core earnings of $127 million were down 12%, driven by launch costs for the new NPIs. Margins in the quarter contracted 200 basis points in the core.","Through the half, the business is on track notwithstanding the foreign exchange challenges. Alstom synergies of $38 million through the second quarter has the business on track to deliver $100 million-plus of synergies for the year. The market reception of the new win products has been solid, and we're progressing down the cost curve. We think the outlook for the onshore wind business is very encouraging.","Next is Aviation. The business delivered another strong quarter, and David gave you an update on where the market stands. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were down 15%, with equipment orders down 37%, driven by no repeat of two large 9X orders in 2015 from Qatar and ANA. This quarter we booked $1.4 billion of commercial engine orders, including a ViaJet (27:35) order for 200 LEAP-1B engines. In addition, we took orders for 348 CFM engines, 21 CF6 engines, and 29 GEnx engines. Not included in the second quarter results and as David mentioned, we won more than $25 billion of orders and commitments at the Farnborough Air Show.","Military equipment orders were up 49%, driven by large orders from the Korean military for F414 engines and T700 helicopter engines, and the Indian Navy for 14 LM2500 engines. Total equipment backlog of $34 billion was down 3% versus last year.","Service orders grew 8% in the second quarter, with commercial services up 9%, driven by spares up 5% and CSA orders higher by 17%. Military services grew 11%. Total service backlog was higher by 14% in the quarter to $122 billion.","Revenues of $6.5 billion were up 4%. Equipment revenues were down 7%, with commercial equipment down 2%. We shipped 78 GEnx engines versus 86 a year ago. We also shipped 11 LEAP-1A engines. Military equipment was down 31%, as we expected, on lower engine shipments. Service revenues grew 16% in the quarter, with our commercial spares rate up 3% and CSAs up 20%.","Operating profit was higher by 6%, driven by services volume, positive value gap, and cost productivity. Margins in the quarter expanded 40 basis points. For the half, op profit grew 11% and margins expanded by 80 basis points. The Aviation team continues to execute well, and as mentioned, we shipped our first 11 LEAP engines and are on schedule to ship about 110 for the year.","Next is Oil & Gas. The environment remains very, very tough. U.S. rig and well counts continued to contract over the second quarter. Rig counts are down 55% year over year and down 79% from year-end 2014. Well counts are down 58% in the U.S. versus the second quarter of last year and down 76% from the third quarter of 2014, their peak.","Based on the latest industry expectations, CapEx spending in 2016 is expected to be down about 14% for IOCs, 9% for NOCs, and about 40% for North American independents. We continue to focus on remaking the cost structure of the business and improving our competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 34%. Equipment orders were down 58% versus 2015, with all segments lower. Service orders contracted 10% versus last year.","Backlog ended the quarter at $22.7 billion, up 1% from the first quarter and down 7% from the second quarter of last year. Year-over-year equipment backlog was down 31%, but the services backlog is actually up 15%.","Revenues in the quarter of $3.2 billion were down 22%, with equipment revenues down 31% and services revenue down 13%. All segments were lower year over year on equipment and service revenue except the turbo machinery business, where the service business grew revenues 4% in the quarter.","Operating profit of $320 million was down 48% versus 2015, driven by lower volume and negative fixed cost leverage, partially offset by $140 million of structural cost-out. The team remains focused on their plan for about $800 million of cost actions in the year. Through the half, approximately $280 million of benefits have been realized, with stronger paybacks expected in the second half of 2016. Oil & Gas is down 40% organically in op profit through the half and continues to execute against a framework of down 30% organic op profit for the year.","Next is Healthcare. The Healthcare team is executing well and delivered a strong second quarter and first half. Orders grew 3% and 4% organically. Geographically, organic orders were higher by 2% in the U.S., 9% in China, 11% in Europe, and 17% in ASEAN. Growth in those markets was partially offset by Latin America, which was down 9% organically on weakness in Brazil.","In terms of business lines, healthcare system orders grew 2% reported and 3% organic, driven by ultrasound up 8% on strength in the U.S. and Europe. Imaging orders were higher by 2% organically, with both CT and MI up double digits, partially offset by X-ray and mammo weakness. Life Sciences continues to grow smartly, with orders up 12% organically. Bioprocess grew 26% and core imaging grew 6%. In the second quarter, our Life Sciences business delivered its first and China's largest biopark with a KUBio product. We believe these modularlized bioprocess facilities will be the future of all biologics.","Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 4% and up 6% organic. Healthcare systems revenues were higher by 4% organically, driven by imaging and ultrasound, up 8% and 7% respectively. Life Sciences continued strong revenue growth, up 8% reported and up 11% organic.","Operating profit in the quarter was up 11% to $782 million. Strong volume and cost productivity more than offset negative price and investments for digital NPI and supply chain costs. Margin rates expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and they're up 80 basis points for the half. The Healthcare team is driving technology competitiveness, transforming their portfolio digitally, and reducing the product and service costs. The team has delivered roughly half the cost-out target of $350 million for the year. The team is on track to deliver or beat the 50 basis points of margin improvement that we set out as a goal for the year.","Our Transportation business continues to deal with a very difficult cycle. In the second quarter, North American commodity carloads were down 11%, driven by coal down 27% and petroleum down 20%. Intermodal volume was down 5%. Parked locomotives have more than doubled over the last year.","Orders of $678 million were down 51% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $117 million were down 77% on orders for 21 locos this year versus 120 units a year ago. Service orders of $561 million were lower by 36%, driven by lower loco parts, partly due to the parking and no repeat of a movement planner order we took last year. Backlog ended at $20.7 billion, which is down 2%, with equipment backlog down 4% and services down 1%.","Revenues were lower by 13% and down 6% organically, reflecting the Signaling disposition. Organically, equipment revenues were up 3% on higher loco shipments, 222 units versus 191 last year, offset by lower services revenue, which was down 14%.","Op profit of $273 million was down 18% and down 14% organically, driven by lower volume and unfavorable mix, offset partially by favorable value gap and cost-out. No doubt, the U.S. environment is challenging. The Transportation team is focused on growing our international business, driving cost out, and executing on our digital strategy.","In our Energy Connections business, as we've discussed on the last two calls, organic performance reflects Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions only. GE's Digital Energy business is treated as a disposition to the Grid JV. Also, as we've discussed, we consolidate 100% of the Grid JV's revenue but only 50% of their operating profit.","Orders for the business totaled $3 billion in the second quarter, up 45%. Orders for Power Conversion and Industrial Solutions totaled $1.6 billion, down 2% organic, and Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion. Core orders were driven by Power Conversion, down 17% organically, on weakness in Oil & Gas and no repeat of a large wind order for converters last year, offset by 1% organic growth in Industrial Solutions.","Backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, with Grid Solutions at $8.2 billion. Revenues in the quarter of $2.7 billion were higher by 55%. Grid Solutions revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Core revenues were down 4% organically.","The business is beginning to make progress. Operating profit improved from a loss of $85 million in the first quarter to a profit of $35 million in the second quarter. The core business recorded a loss of $9 million on lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital spend and dispositions, and the Grid Solutions business earned $45 million in the quarter. Alstom synergies remain on track to deliver $200 million-plus of benefits for the year, and we expect the business will continue to improve earnings sequentially in the second half.","Next on Appliance & Lighting, we closed the Appliance transaction on June 6. And as I mentioned on the one-time items page, we had a pre-tax gain of $3.1 billion, which translated to $0.20 of EPS.","In the quarter, revenue was down 25%, driven by Appliances down 31% due to the sale. Lighting revenues were down 11%, with the legacy lighting business down 23% and the LED product line up 4%.","Segment profit of $96 million was down 42%, driven by the sale of Appliances and our investment in Kern. Going forward, we'll be reporting Energy Connections and Lighting as a single segment.","Last, I'll cover GE Capital. As mentioned earlier, on June 28, GE Capital was de-designated as a systemically important financial institution, marking a major step in our GE Capital exit plan.","Our vertical businesses earned $452 million this quarter, down 15% from prior year, including higher base earnings offset by lower gains and higher insurance reserve provisions resulting from updates to our models on our runoff long-term care book. Portfolio quality remains stable.","In the second quarter, the verticals wrote $2.1 billion of on-book volume, 75% of which supported our Industrial businesses. In addition, GE Capital arranged third-party financing which supported an additional $1.1 billion of Industrial orders.","Other continuing operations generated a $1.1 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividend payments, headquarter operating costs, restructuring, and asset liability management actions.","Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $0.5 billion, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.1 billion loss.","GE Capital ended the quarter with $116 billion of ENI excluding liquidity, with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the second quarter was $56 billion, which was down $50 billion from the first quarter, driven by debt maturities and lower deposits as a result of the sale of GE Capital Money Bank in the U.S. and the IPO of our check platform.","Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter we closed $12 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $158 billion. In July, we've added $10 billion of closings, driven by the sale of our French and German CLL businesses, bringing the total to date of closes to $168 billion.","In addition to closings, we signed agreements to sell $16 billion of ENI in the second quarter, taking our total signings to $181 billion during the first half of the year.","Our price to tangible book on deals signed to date is 1.2 times, and we are on track to deliver the 1.1 times price-to-book we estimated when we announced the restructuring.","Of the remaining $25 billion assets to go, we anticipate that we will run off about $10 billion of assets where it makes more economic sense to do so. The remaining assets are comprised of our Italian bank, our French mortgage book, and other smaller portfolios and investments. That will be largely signed, we believe, by the end of the third quarter of this year.","GE Capital paid $3.5 billion of dividends during the quarter, for a total of $11 billion during the first half of the year. In July, GE Capital has paid an additional $4 billion, bringing our year-to-date total to $15 billion, well ahead of our original plan. We remain on track to meet our $18 billion target of dividends for the year.","Overall, Keith [Sherin] and the GE Capital team have continued to execute well ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan. We expect to be largely completed by the end of 2016.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","We really have no change for the operating framework in the year. There are always a few puts and takes, but we remain on track. We will hit our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS goal despite FX headwinds of $0.02 to $0.04 in the year, and we expect to deliver $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions, in line with our plans.","I thought we'd give you some context for the company beyond 2016, particularly given the volatility of our markets. First, Alstom is on track, and I expect us to hit all of our goals. Transportation and Oil & Gas are in tough cycles. They represent 15% of our earnings, and it's hard to see them improving in 2017. But at the same time, Power and Aviation remain strong. They're 60% of our earnings, and we see consistent performance year over year. They have very strong service franchises, productivity programs, and our market positions are growing. Healthcare, Energy Connections, and Renewables have generally favorable markets and real opportunities for growth and margin expansion. In particular, Healthcare feels sustainable, with diverse growth and market momentum. These businesses represent 25% of our earnings. And we'll continue to execute on GE Capital and Corporate.","So really, 85% of our company is in great shape, winning in markets with high visibility, and so we remain on track for the 2018 bridge to $2.00 a share of EPS. The strength of our diversified model is key in a volatile environment.","Matt, now over to you for questions.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Thanks, Jeff. I'll ask that the operator opens the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","When I look at your top line forecast for the back half of the year, and considering I don't think the world is getting better, and I think that's going to be part of my question for you, but how do we get to that 2% core growth number? Is it just comps in Oil & Gas get easier and that just provides a tailwind, or is there something else you're seeing in macro that should make us feel a little bit better about the world?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Scott, I'll start and then maybe toss it over to Jeff. But again, I think just like we said on the first quarter call, we think Power really explains the first half\/second half split. As you can look in the presentation, the year-over-year comps are better. The backlog is strong. You're going to ship most of the gas turbine units in the second half plus the 50% growth in the AGPs. Oil & Gas has got easier comps, but we're not really counting on that much out of Oil & Gas. And then the rest of the company, the underlying companies, mid-single-digit, 5% organic growth. So I think it's really a Power story when you think about it, and that's really in backlog and that really explains how we think about the first half\/second half. I think the world itself, Scott, is no better, no worse, so we just see the general trend on markets. Jeff?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't have much to add other than when you think about Power, about 65% of our gas turbines are in the second half. AGPs will grow 60% year over year in the second half. That's a big source of it. Oil & Gas, the comps do get better or less difficult in the second half of the year. And we've got about 70%-plus of the revenue for Oil & Gas, based on our forecast of revenue the second half in backlog. And as you mentioned, the balance of portfolio, we expect roughly mid-single-digit growth.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","This is really the profile we expected, I think.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks a lot.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. My question was just around the margin bridge on slide five. Just in light of input costs and your own pricing outlook, how do you see the value gap item trending? And then the quick follow-up would just be on the base inflation number there. That was a 110 bps headwind in Q2. Just explain that, please.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So a couple thoughts. On value gap for the year, I don't think we've changed our outlook. We've said we expect value gap for the year to be roughly flat or neutral for the year, with strong \u2013 roughly $1 billion direct material benefits, offset by price and a little bit of inflation on our other variable costs, so no change of outlook on value gap. Value gap in the second quarter discretely was a positive, not huge but it was a positive in the second quarter.","As you work down that margin walk, the 110 basis points in other, 40 basis points of that is foreign exchange. It's the marks generally on our hedges that are moving through that line. Then you get about 40 basis points of inflation on other base costs, including compensation, et cetera; and then a small impact associated with minority interest in JVs, which is about a 20 basis point negative in the quarter.","Operator","The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, just two things on digital. One, on the partners, you were targeting 50-plus for the year. A month ago you were at 31, now you're at 54. Maybe just comment on that rapid pace of additions. What are you seeing in maybe some of the recent partnerships?","And then for David on the 35,000 engines monitored, curious how that's ramped so far. And are you seeing that pick up, and where do you see that going over the next couple years?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Shannon, I'll hit the first one. Again, I think the momentum for Predix is growing. There's no doubt that partnerships like the one with Microsoft, the notion of putting Predix as really the analytical platform inside of Azure I think is a big signal to the industry. Huawei in China is another great relationship that will help us extend on a global basis big wins like the one with Schindler, I think gets us in a completely new industry space for Predix. So I just think what you're seeing is momentum taking off, and we're pleased with the partnership numbers. And I think that will continue to accelerate through the year.","David L. Joyce - Senior Vice President; President & CEO-GE Aviation","Shannon, hi. This is David Joyce. On the 35,000 engines installed, we have a number of different ways in which we take data off the engines. The newer the airplanes, of course, the more accessible the data is on a real-time basis. And then the older the airplane, then we have to go and actually get the data after it lands. But I would say we're making great progress. We're actually starting to connect data acquisition as part of our services contracts. As we take on the risk, which is part of the service contract, we're requesting that we have the ability to go get the data so we can do the evaluations and get the productivity for both our customer and ourselves, so good progress.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Andrew, how are you?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good. Can you talk about organic services orders in the quarter? They were negative 1%. The core services backlog is up 11%. So you still seem in good shape for services growth in the back half. But was the services order number in line with your expectation, given it was down a bit from 1Q's 4%? Is it really just Oil & Gas services weighing and the timing of AGPs weighing on the business and the confidence level that services orders gets better in the second half of the year?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Andrew, again, I think sometimes, particularly with AGPs, there's some timing involved. I think in the second half of the year in services, we expect orders to be mid-single-digits positive. So again, our business model there, 5% organic growth in the first half, backlog growth, and our visibility in the second half I think is all quite positive around services.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would just add, I talked about AGPs being up 60% year over year in the second half and a total year outlook of 135 to 150 versus 119 last year. That is a big driver. We see double-digit services order growth in the second half of the year here and very solid mid-single-digit growth in our Aviation service business. And those are the two big drivers on the service side.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. I just was wondering if we could also just address the back-loading to some degree through the profit lines. At EPG you talked about 5% underlying growth in the Industrial businesses ex-Alstom. Obviously we're starting off in the hole here in the first half. Should we expect some OP growth in the third quarter, or does that profit ramp really have to all manifest itself in the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Listen, we're going to have a very large fourth quarter because we've got an enormous Renewables and Power fourth quarter, no question about it. We expect to grow sequentially in the third quarter. I'm not giving you third quarter op profit guidance. But I think the variables that we've talked about, Power volume in the second half of the year, Oil & Gas on a year-over-year basis less negative than they were in the first half of the year. We expect Energy Connections to accelerate, and we expect the Alstom synergies as well as the ROME (50:50) restructuring synergies to really kick-in in the second half of the year. We're looking for a real acceleration there.","So that's where we see the op profit growth in the second half of the year, one. Two, that's why we're so confident that we can deliver 50 basis points of margin expansion for the total year, having been flat in the first half.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would only add to what Jeff said. Again, I think a lot of this is a Power story. And with their shipment backlog in the second half, their operating profit growth is quite robust in the second half of the year. And I think, Jeff, the way you think about the walk I think is still more or less intact from the standpoint of how we think about the company for 2016.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just a question on G-SIFI and the impact on your appetite for accelerated buyback or more M&A. I think at EPG you said that you were busy with Alstom but it just seems G-SIFI came a lot faster than we expected, and it gives you an opportunity to use your balance sheet. So both, if you could, address appetite for more buyback and appetite for more M&A in the near term. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, so I would maybe talk about the capital allocation piece. And, Jeff, maybe you talk about the leverage piece. So I'd say capital allocation hasn't really changed that much since EPG. I think we're just looking for the highest return. I think, Andrew, we've got a lot of good ideas inside the company, but we'll be disciplined about those ideas. And it's really for us just making the right \u2013 the smart investments for investors vis-\u00e0-vis buyback versus acquisitions. But we always have good ideas inside the company. And, Jeff, on the...","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would just say, just remember that the $18 billion target we have for GE Capital difference in the year assumed that we would de-designate. So there's no change in that framework. It happened sooner rather than later, which is really outstanding, and that has allowed us to accelerate the buyback. I talked about the $5 billion loan we did in the year through GE Capital (53:09), where they have excess debt, excess cash. We took that and we did a $5 billion ASR here in June, and so our buyback through the first half of the year is about $13.7 billion, so we're running ahead of the plan here. Our average buyback is below $30 a share, so I think we feel pretty good about that.","On the leverage, the leverage is going to be paced by the opportunities to put that capital to work if we, in fact, do it, and the returns that we can generate for shareholders. And I would say everything else being equal, I think we've consistently said we're more focused on M&A and where those opportunities lie than we are on anything else, and that will be paced on the ideas that we have.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So I guess my one question is maybe on Oil & Gas. You're down, EBIT is down about 40% to start the year, in the first half of the year. You're trying to hold to 30% for the entire year, yet pricing continues to get worse. I guess maybe just talk a little bit about your confidence in trying to make up some of the gap on the Oil & Gas EBIT in the second half of the year.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Listen, I think this is all about what we talked to you about in terms of restructuring the cost in the business. And through the first half of the year, we realized about $300 million, a little less than $300 million of benefits through the entirety of the income statement around all those efforts, head count, cost, deflation, restructuring agreements with suppliers, et cetera. We're still pushing hard for the $800 million in the second half of the year. So you get a real acceleration between what we started and executed in 2015, what we've executed in the first half of 2016, that everything else being equal, we expect to deliver an additional $500 million of cost-out in the second half of the year.","So if volume stays intact and our outlook on revenue in the second half is roughly close, we ought to be in reasonably good shape. There's some risk, obviously, that if volume is a little bit lighter that some of the benefits, even though the actions have been taken, because you lose the volume leverage may not materialize. But I think we feel, and Lorenzo [Simonelli] and the team feel really good about the execution they're doing around the restructuring in the projects inside the business.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Just if I could get a little clarity on Alstom, you walked through the numbers in the supplemental around the $100 million operating loss, $300 million-ish benefit on synergies, and the offset on some of the one-time investments to get those. Maybe just talk about where are you seeing the growth recovery here? What's driving that? What do you think is sustainable, and how should we expect a little more color there going forward?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, so, I'll take a crack and, Jeff, you could add to it. But again, I think if you look at the gas turbine Balance of Plant activity, Steve, we're already seeing tremendous pull-through vis-\u00e0-vis the Balance of Plant. Services, I think the customer reception in services is quite positive. And so we're seeing good activity around energy efficiency upgrades, bringing AGPs to the steam side as well as the gas side, things like that. I think similarly Grid revenue growth, which is something that we hadn't put a lot of benefits towards, I think we see Grid as being potential upside as time goes on as well. So I would say Balance of Plant, more steam activity than we had anticipated, better Grid acceptance than we had forecasted, and services, which was really the way we underwrote the deal in the first place, is quite positive for Alstom.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, I would just add. Listen, the team is executing. Through the half we've got in excess of $400 million of synergies executed so far against the goal of $1.1 billion for the year. That feels good. As Jeff said, the Power I mentioned earlier when I went through the results. The backlog we acquired in the Power business is up 22% as of the first half. So those synergies on the growth side are absolutely materializing here, and we feel great about that.","So I think the execution is pretty good. We did have a cash use for the first half of the year. We expected a cash use for the first half of the year. We hope to be neutral for the year as part of the cash recovery in the second half of the year. But I would say on par, I think we feel really good about both the cost and the growth synergies we're realizing so far.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just to follow up on an earlier question, when you say growth in the third quarter, is that seasonal from an operating profit perspective? And then with your second half cash flow guidance, that $8 billion that you highlighted there on backing into something that's around $18 billion, is that the right profit number for the year that underlies that $8 billion in operating \u2013 net income plus D&A contribution?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There are multiple questions in there. Let me start with this. Let me start with CFOA. So through the half, Industrial CFOA was about $400 million. So when we look to the second half, we've guided $12 billion to $14 billion for the year. We've not changed anything about that guidance.","So how do you go from $400 million of Industrial CFOA in the first half to $12 billion to $14 billion for the year? We look at earnings, cash earnings. So adding back depreciation and amortization as you look forward to the second half, we see that as about $8 billion. We think we're going to reduce working capital $3 billion to $4 billion. A big part of that is the inventory reductions that we talked about, partly driven by Power but also driven by Renewable and our other businesses. And we need to be better on receivables. Our delinquency rates in the first half were higher than we estimated. We think we can get that back on par. So if we just get back to the inventory performance we went out of 2015 with, if we get back to delinquency and receivable performance that we ended 2015 with, that in total generates about $3 billion to $4 billion of working capital cash flow.","And then I just talked about Alstom. So we used a little more than $800 million of cash in the first half of the year on Alstom. We still expect to be roughly neutral in the second half of the year, so that's an $800 million turnaround.","And then I think earlier when I went through the results, I talked about we had some unfavorable timing on tax. That's not an issue for the year. That's just a first half\/second half issue. So that's how we got to work our way back to $12 billion to $14 billion of CFOA for the year, which supports what Jeff talked about of $29 billion to $32 billion of free cash flow plus dispositions for the total company.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I would say beyond that for 2016, we profiled that at the end of the first quarter call. We really have no change in how we see the year.","Operator","The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey, I know we've covered a lot of ground here, but I just want to circle back to your opening comments about still in a slow-growth macro environment. Maybe you could provide some of those geographic data points, U.S., Europe, Asia, developed versus developing.","And then on the Europe side, I know it's still early, too early to tell, but does Brexit pose any unique risks for GE as you see it today?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Deane, what I would do is I would say versus just talking geographically, I would talk industry-wide and go back to, say, Oil & Gas and Transportation, which are both really around the resource sector, oil on the Oil & Gas side and coal on the Transportation side. Those are tough cycles, and those are tough cycles mainly in North America.","The Power and Aviation businesses, we don't see \u2013 we see continued Aviation strength. The Power market is okay, but there's plenty of growth out there for us to go after and go get.","Healthcare is better, not just in the U.S., but globally. Energy Connections, the Oil & Gas stuff is tough, but the rest of the stuff is quite strong. And we think Renewables is in a very good cycle right now, both in the U.S. and globally. So that's the mix of the world.","Now if you bore in on some place like China, the Healthcare business was awesome in China. Our Energy orders grew by more than 30% in the second quarter in China. Aviation was negative, but that really wasn't because of revenue passenger miles. That was because we had big orders last year. So we see, I would say, around the edges, China getting better, Europe stable. And then you can \u2013 puts and takes in the rest of the world. So there's plenty of growth out there for us to go get in the second half and into 2017.","In terms of Brexit, I just think Brexit is just another point of volatility. It wasn't the outcome we hoped for, but we were plenty ready for that as just another point of volatility.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Great, Jeff. A couple of quick announcements, I'll pass it back to you to wrap up. The replay for today's call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website, and we'll be doing our third quarter earnings call on Friday, October 21.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great, Matt. Thanks.","I would just say first half more or less what we expected, positioned for a strong second half of 2016 with what we have in backlog. I think looking forward, we are again confirming the bridge to $2.00 a share by 2018. And it's really driven by real strength in Power and Aviation, strong turnarounds in Energy Conversion, Healthcare, Renewables, good Alstom execution. And the strength of the GE portfolio I think offsets weaknesses in the Oil & Gas and Transportation business, and that really is the strength of the company is the diversified portfolio and the ability to meet our commitments, even with this volatility.","Matthew G.

Then Jamie will cover the quarter in greater detail before I wrap with an overview of our Renewable Energy business and our outlook.","Let me begin by reiterating that 2019 remains a reset year for GE. We made some progress in the first quarter and that continued in the second quarter. I'll remind you though that our own actions and the market dynamics may not always follow a straight line, but I will draw your attention to those elements that are most important for GE's results today and tomorrow.","First, our year-to-date performance is ahead of our outlook in several areas. We have not planned for perfection meaning we have planned conservatively to cover market and execution risks specifically within our Power business. At the halfway point, our performance at Power is better than expected including better project execution, orders and working capital management.","Restructuring spend is also lower. Accordingly, we are raising our outlook for organic growth, adjusted EPS and Industrial free cash flow, which we now expect to be negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion while holding our margin guidance. This is progress, but let me be clear, even with this mid-year increase we recognize that our revised free cash flow range includes negative territory. Over time, as our operational improvements take hold, we continue to expect significantly better cash results.","Now looking at quarterly results, we saw top-line strength. Orders were up 4% organically due to strength in Renewable Energy and Oil & gas. We ended the quarter with backlog of $369 billion up 11% year-on-year. This is comprised of equipment of $85 billion up 4%; and services of $312 billion up 13%.","Services continue to be our most profitable part of the portfolio and a key differentiator with our customers. We are focused on growing and continuously improving these services across GE, which contributed to just over half of our revenues in the quarter.","Industrial segment revenue was up 7% organically driven by growth in each segment except Power. Adjusted Industrial operating margins contracted 300 basis points organically due to significant declines in Renewables, Power and to a lesser extent Aviation, but this is not a surprise. While the make-up may be slightly different in total this is in line and not out of range with our full year margin outlook.","We separated Grid Solutions out of Power for better strategic alignment. We moved the higher-margin grid software business into Digital and the lower-margin grid equipment and services business into Renewables. This put the spotlight on the equipment and services business, triggering a $744 million non-cash goodwill impairment and we wrote down the entire goodwill associated with this portion of the business. Jamie will talk to this in more detail in a few minutes.","Our adjusted Industrial free cash flow was a negative $1 billion down $1.3 billion from the prior year. This was at the high end of our quarterly outlook largely driven by improved execution at Power, fulfillment timing and better orders at Renewables as well as lower restructuring.","Looking to the second half, we need to continue executing in Power and Renewables especially on projects, delivery, cost and service. We are taking actions to delever, and at our upcoming strategy reviews, we will begin to roll-out Hoshin Kanri, our policy deployment the best method I know to bridge strategic intent with operating priorities deeply in a business.","And of course, we are monitoring and managing a number of watch items including trade and tariffs the 737 MAX grounding, lower interest rates and our annual insurance premium deficiency and goodwill testing due for the third quarter.","Let me cover our two strategic priorities for 2019 in a bit more detail. First with respect to improving our financial position, we monetized part of our 25% ownership in Wabtec, which was oversubscribed delivering $1.8 billion in cash proceeds. We still hold an approximate 12% stake that we will monetize over time.","We were also making progress on the Biopharma sale, which will deliver about $20 billion of cash proceeds. At GE Capital, we continue to make the business smaller and simpler completing approximately $2 billion of asset reduction year-to-date and moving $4 billion of aircraft lending receivables to held for sale. We ended the quarter in a solid liquidity position with just under $30 billion of cash at Industrial and Capital combined excluding BHGE.","Next on strengthening the businesses, at Power we're seeing early signs of stabilization as we've been focused on improving daily execution. At Gas Power, orders were up 28% organically bringing our total gas turbine units orders to 35 in the first half and we are rightsizing the business for market realities reducing fixed cost by an additional 10% in the quarter.","At Renewable Energy orders and revenues were up double-digits, as we execute on our steep production ramp. In the first half, we delivered approximately 1,500 turbines and repower kits and in the second half of the year, we expect to approximately double the number of deliveries.","At Aviation, we announced record wins at the Paris Air Show, which contributed to sequential backlog growth of 9%. And as it relates to the 737 MAX, we are working closely with Boeing to actively manage production, while the fleet remains grounded.","In Healthcare, profit margins expanded 80 basis points organically. In our first collaboration with Roche, we released the NAVIFY Tumor Board 2.0, which integrates the Tumor Board with our medical image viewer allowing radiologists and medical professionals from other cancer care disciplines to use the same dashboard for patient care.","To support our businesses, we need the right combination of direction and leadership. We made a number of new hires including a Digital CEO, a CFO at the Power portfolio and regional Healthcare CEOs in China and the U.S. and Canada.","We also appointed Monish Patolawala, the current CFO of Healthcare to lead GE's operational transformation driving operating rigor and lean management across the company. Monish reports directly to me.","Russell Stokes decided to jump in and lead the Power Conversion turnaround himself. In addition to looking after the Power portfolio, Russell is bringing a greater operational focus to a business in turnaround mode.","And with Monish in his new capacity, we brought more than 100 GE leaders to Greenville for a week-long lean action workout in June. As I've mentioned, the reemergence of lean in all we do represents a major improvement opportunity in manufacturing and throughout the various functions at GE. What does this exactly mean? It's really about the way we are going to work, the most important being hyper-focused on the customer and seeing GE through the customers' eyes, especially regarding our quality and delivery performance.","Let me give you a couple of lean examples. In Healthcare, we recently value streamed macro billing cycle looking at the to and the from seeing five days of cash cycle reduction opportunity. And that wouldn't be a permanent end state. With automation and better governance of our billing processes, we've already improved by a day and see an opportunity to take full advantage of the five-day opportunity on the value stream map.","At Power, as a direct result of our Greenville workout, we installed one single piece flow line for our HA turbine buckets, successfully connecting 15 machines and six independent processes. Due to this improvement, we've reduced the work-in-progress inventory from approximately 1,200 pieces to 65. Now I know these examples may seem small they are, but I think they're indicative of the opportunities we see across the entire company.","In summary, we're on our way, but these are two quarters in what will undoubtedly be a reset year. I'm encouraged cautiously by what we've accomplished, but there's much more to do. Before I hand it over to Jamie to go through the quarter in greater detail, I expect that most of you have seen today's announcement regarding Jamie and our initiation of a search for a new CFO. With the stabilization beginning to take hold, this is the right time for a change.","I want to take this opportunity to thank Jamie for her many contributions to the company, both as CFO and previously as a GE business leader. Jamie has been instrumental in working with the Board and me to develop our portfolio strategy, furthering our efforts to make GE a more focused industrial company and spearheading our deleveraging plan during an incredibly challenging period. I'm grateful for her willingness to support us through this transition.","Jamie, I'll now turn it over to you.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, Larry. I'll start with the second quarter summary. Orders were $28.7 billion, down 4% reported, but up 4% organically with strength in equipment, primarily in Renewables and Power. Services orders were up 3% organically, driven principally by Renewables and Oil & Gas. Consolidated revenue was down 1% with Industrial segment revenues flat on a reported basis and up 7% organically. The biggest driver of growth was the renewable onshore wind ramp, which was up 80% in the quarter.","Year-to-date, Industrial segment revenues are up 6% organically. Adjusted Industrial profit margins were 7.6% in the quarter, down 260 basis points year-over-year reported and down 300 basis points organically. As Larry mentioned, this is driven by significant declines in Renewables and Power and to a lesser extent Aviation, which I'll cover shortly.","Net earnings per share was $0.01 loss, which includes income associated with discontinued operations for GE Capital. And GAAP continuing EPS was negative $0.03 and adjusted EPS was $0.17. In the quarter, the IRS completed their routine audit of our 2012 and 2013 U.S. income tax returns. We had previously reserved for tax uncertainties associated with these filings that were resolved decreasing unrecognized tax benefits. This had a $0.06 impact in continuing earnings and a $0.04 impact in discontinued operations, which were in our 2019 plan though not in the second quarter as the specific timing was unknown.","Walking from GAAP continuing EPS of negative $0.03. We had $0.03 of losses, primarily from the partial sale of our Wabtec stake, unrealized mark to market of our remaining equity as well as a held-for-sale mark on BHGE's reciprocating compressors business. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.03 of charges principally in corporate and Power. Non-operating pension and other benefit plans were $0.05 in the quarter. Lastly, we took a $0.09 non-cash goodwill impairment charge.","As a consequence of separating the two businesses in the Grid Solutions realignment, we were required to reallocate its goodwill based on the relative fair values of the equipment and services business and the software business. The remaining fair value of the Grid Solutions equipment and services business was below its carrying value, resulting in the goodwill impairment and there is no remaining goodwill associated with this business. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the second quarter.","Moving to cash. Adjusted Industrial free cash flow was a usage of $1 billion for the quarter and $1.3 billion lower than the prior year. Income, depreciation and amortization totaled $1.7 billion, down $400 million after adjusting for the non-cash goodwill impairment. Working capital was negative, primarily driven by accounts receivable, which was impacted by the timing of collections from Boeing related to the 737 MAX and organic sales growth.","Inventory was also a usage of cash as we continue to build inventory for higher second half shipments, principally on onshore wind and to a lesser extent Aviation commercial engines. Contract assets were a source of cash of $100 million. Other CFOA was negative $800 million, primarily driven by cash taxes. We also spent about $900 million in growth CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE, which is up slightly, driven by capacity investments in Renewables and Aviation.","At the half, free cash flow was negative $2.2 billion, down $800 million. Many of the year-to-date cash flow impacts are the same as what we saw in the second quarter including pressure from the onshore wind ramp and 737 MAX grounding.","Overall, in the first half, our cash generation is running ahead of our prior outlook. This is largely attributable to better-than-expected performance at Power due to project execution and working capital improvements, impacting both collections and disbursements as well as lower restructuring cash costs across the segment from a mix of timing, attrition and executing projects at lower costs.","As previously discussed, the MAX was originally outside the scope of our planning, and year-to-date it impacted our cash flow by about $600 million or $300 million per quarter.","However, for the first half improved performance at Power as well as better aftermarket sales, services billings and timing of discount payments more than outweigh the cash flow pressure at Aviation. In the second half, if the plane remains grounded, we anticipate a negative impact of roughly $400 million per quarter.","Looking at the full year, recall our original 2019 guidance for Industrial free cash flow was negative $2 billion to 0. That outlook reflected the potential for substantial variability period-to-period from our large global equipment-focused businesses as well as numerous transition items that are difficult to forecast, such as the supply chain finance program transition, the anticipated settlement of legacy legal matters, restructuring and the watch items Larry mentioned.","However, the improvements in Power lower restructuring and higher earnings, along with better visibility at the half, give us confidence to raise our full year industrial free cash flow guidance to negative $1 billion to positive $1 billion.","Moving to liquidity, we ended the second quarter with $16.9 billion of Industrial cash excluding Baker Hughes GE. As discussed, Industrial free cash flow was a usage of cash of $1 billion, and we paid approximately $100 million in dividends on the quarter.","We received $1.7 billion of cash net of taxes and fees related to the Wabtec transaction, and another $400 million from other dispositions. We contributed $1.5 billion of cash into GE Capital, which was used to fund the WMC settlement with the DOJ. All other items were a source of $400 million, which principally includes the reimbursement of cash owed to us from Wabtec and change in debt.","In line with our ongoing goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, average short-term funding needs declined from about $15 billion in the second quarter of 2018 to about $4 billion this quarter.","As stated, our goal is to get to about $5 billion of short-term intra-quarter funding needs while we execute our deleveraging plan. But we potentially could see some fluctuation in these borrowing levels in subsequent 2019 quarters based on disposition timing.","As it relates to our leverage targets, we expect to make significant progress toward our leverage goals by the end of 2020, despite the low interest rate environment. We continue to evaluate the best mix of opportunities for deleveraging, considering economics, risk mitigation and optimal capital structure.","Next on Power, orders of $4.9 billion were down 22% reported, but up 2% organically. Gas Power orders were up 27% reported with equipment up 2.5 times and services down 13%.","We booked 4.6 gigawatts of orders for 16 heavy-duty gas turbines and four aeroderivative units, which represent profitable growth and have lower execution risk. This was the second strong quarter of orders growth for equipment, which contributed to the Gas Power backlog, which is up 5% to $71 billion.","That said, we're continuing to restructure for the new gas unit market at 25 to 30 gigawatts per year. Power portfolio orders were down 62% reported and down 32% organically, largely driven by steam power systems with no repeat and a large nuclear steam order in the second quarter of 2018.","Power revenue of $4.7 billion was down 25% reported and down 5% organically. Gas Power revenue was down 5% in line with our expectations. We shipped four heavy-duty gas turbines and seven aeroderivative units in the quarter versus seven and five respectively in the second quarter of 2018.","We helped our customers achieve commercial operation on over 35 units and added almost 8.5 gigawatts of power to the grid. Gas Power services revenue was down 13% with transactional revenues up, more than offset by contractual services revenues down due in large part to the outage volume and mix in the second quarter.","Power portfolio revenue was down 5% organically. Operating profit of $117 million was down 71% reported and segment margins were 2.5% in the quarter, largely due to the impact of dispositions, volume and lower productivity in Power Services.","At Gas Power, we're making meaningful progress on our $800 million fixed cost reduction plan over the next two years. Variable cost productivity also continues to be an area of focus, and we reduced the net employee count at Gas Power by 1,000 versus the beginning of the year.","We exited nine offices and two warehouses in the first half and we are on track to decrease the number of offices by more than 25% and warehouses by more than one-third by the end of 2020.","At the half, orders of $8.6 billion were down 20% reported and up 7% organically. Revenue of $9.3 billion was down 24% reported and down 4% organically. Segment margins were 2.5%. Operating profit of $228 million was down 65% on a reported basis and 61% organically.","We are only a few quarters into the Power turnaround, we now expect full year free cash flow to be flat to down instead of just down while we are on track to deliver revenues down high single digits and positive segment margins.","Next I'll cover Renewable Energy. And as a reminder the Grid Solutions equipment and services business is now included in Renewables as a result of the realignment and this is reflected in the results we posted today.","For reference, Grid Solutions is roughly 25% of Renewables revenues in the quarter. Renewables orders of $3.7 billion were up 35% reported and up 38% organically. Onshore wind orders were up 87% mainly driven by the U.S. up two times. We have observed pricing stabilizing in line with our expectations. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 26% reported and up 33% organically. Onshore wind sales were up 81% reported, mainly driven by strong equipment volume.","The business generated an operating loss of $184 million, down $269 million versus prior year and segment margins were negative 5%. A large part of this decline is due to higher losses in Grid Solutions, hydro and offshore wind as we began fully consolidating these legacy Alstom JVs in the fourth quarter of 2018.","In addition, we faced headwinds from higher losses on legacy contracts, challenging onshore project execution in Asia Pacific, increased R&D investment for the Cypress and Haliade-X, tariffs and pricing. This was partially offset by cost productivity and strong volume.","Onshore wind in the quarter and year-to-date was profitable. Our top priorities in the second half are quality and delivery. Based on the delivery ramp, we expect Renewables to remain on track for the full year guidance of double-digit revenue organic growth and with the addition of Grid Solutions, we expect the margin rate to be negative in 2019.","Next on Aviation where we celebrated 100 years as a business in July, orders of $8.6 billion were down 10% reported and 9% organically. Equipment orders were down 24%, driven by commercial engines down 34% on four significant GEnx orders in the second quarter of 2018.","LEAP orders were up 77% on 693 LEAP engines for both Boeing and Airbus airframers. Service orders grew 3%. Additionally backlog grew to $244 billion, up 9% sequentially driven in part by a portion of the $55 billion of wins announced at the Paris Air Show.","Revenue of $7.9 billion was up, 5% reported and 6% organically. Equipment revenue grew 5% driven by commercial engine, partially offset by military. We shipped 437 LEAP engines this quarter versus 250 in the second quarter of 2018 and CFM56 engine shipments were down 65%.","Military equipment was down due to timing of equipment deliveries. Service revenue grew 5% driven by commercial services. The spares rate was up 2% in the quarter driven by timing and this brings our year-to-date spares rate to 28.5 million per day, up 10% in line with our high single digits low double digits guide for the total year.","Operating profit of $1.4 billion was down 6% reported on negative mix, partially offset by improved price. Segment margins of 17.6% contracted by 200 basis points reported in the quarter versus the prior year.","The margin rate dilution as in prior quarters was driven primarily by the CFM-to-LEAP transition, which was 80 basis points and the Passport engine shipment, which was another 90 basis points. Additional headwinds included a bad debt charge on one customer in a challenging financial position and additional cost on the GE9X certification delay as David shared with you at the Paris Air Show. There is no change to prior guidance.","Looking at the year-to-date Aviation results. Revenue was up 9% organically. Segment margins were 19.2%. We're still on track to deliver high single-digit revenue growth and segment margins of approximately 20% in 2019.","Looking at Healthcare. Orders of $5.2 billion were down 2% reported and up 3% organically, driven by equipment orders up 3% and services up 2% with Europe up 5% and China up 9%, partially offset by the U.S. down 2%.","On a product line basis Healthcare Systems orders were flat organically driven by growth in ultrasound and services, offset by imaging and Life Care Solutions largely due to U.S. order closure timing. Life Sciences orders were up 12% organically.","Revenue of $4.9 billion was down 1% reported and up 4% organically. Healthcare systems revenue was up 1% organically with strong growth in Japan and Latin America, partly offset by pressure in China, the U.S. and the Middle East, particularly in imaging. Life Sciences was up 12% organically.","Operating profit of $958 million was up 3% reported and 9% organically and segment margins were 19.4%, up 80 basis points. Organic operating profit growth was driven by volume and cost productivity, partially offset by inflation, tariffs and program investment. Cost productivity was driven by continued execution on design engineering, sourcing and services productivity.","Healthcare is on track to deliver the 2019 outlook, which includes BioPharma of mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and margin expansion. Moving to Oil & Gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning. And Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today following ours.","On GE Capital, continuing operations generated a net loss of $89 million in the quarter, which was favorable versus prior year, primarily due to timing of higher gains including the sale of an EFS equity investment, lower impairments, lower interest costs and the non-repeat of prior year asset and liability management actions, partially offset by lower base earnings due to asset reductions.","We ended the quarter with $109 billion of assets, excluding liquidity; up by $2 billion sequentially, driven by insurance investment activities and unrealized gains. GE Capital completed asset reductions of more than $500 million in the second quarter, totaling approximately $2 billion year-to-date and is on track to execute approximately $10 billion of asset reductions in 2019.","We also classified $3.6 billion of aircraft lending receivables as held for sale, which is not incremental to the $10 billion target and will offset asset growth and other capital businesses, which have a stronger alignment to support GE Industrial growth. We remain committed to our strategy of shrinking the balance sheet and achieving a debt-to-equity ratio of less than four times by 2020.","We finished the quarter with $12.5 billion of liquidity, which was down $3 billion sequentially, primarily driven by debt maturities. Activity in the quarter also included the $1.5 billion WMC payment to the DOJ, offset by the parent equity infusion to GE Capital of $1.5 billion. We still plan to contribute $4 billion in total to GE Capital in 2019, including $2.5 billion in the second half. We ended with $61 billion of debt, which was down by $2 billion sequentially, primarily driven by debt maturities.","Discontinued operations earned $238 million, driven mainly by the resolution of the IRS audit for the 2012-2013 years, partially offset by charges related to the WMC bankruptcy and other trailing costs. WMC filed for bankruptcy in April and intends to file a Chapter 11 plan to complete an efficient and orderly resolution. As we look out to second half, we expect lower earnings, driven by lower asset sale gains and lower base earnings. We will also perform our annual insurance premium deficiency testing, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2019.","At corporate, adjusted operating costs were $462 million, up versus prior year, primarily due to accruals for existing environmental health and safety matters. We are still targeting $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of net retained corporate costs for the full year. However, we now expect to be at the high end of that range.","Today corporate-managed head count stands at about 12,000, down from our starting point of about 26,000 in mid-2018, with more than two-thirds of that reduction to date coming from internal transfers to the businesses and the remainder from outsourcing, restructuring and attrition.","The bottom line is, year-to-date we have exited about 1,500 of corporate head count with real cost out, most of which is reflected in the segment results. As we said last quarter, we have a long way to go on rightsizing corporate, but we continue to push control and accountability down to the segments and remain committed to reducing net retained corporate costs to less than $700 million by 2021.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Jamie, thanks. Given the recent alignment, we thought it would be helpful to spend a few minutes on Renewable Energy. It's comprised of four different businesses: onshore, offshore, Grid Solutions' equipment and services business and hydro. Strategically and operationally, we think it makes sense to have these four under the same umbrella, as there are substantial revenue and cost synergy opportunities.","That said, they're each at different stages. In onshore, where we have the number one position in the U.S. we've launched the Cypress which has received its first launch orders. In offshore, we're in development mode, as we build our global presence and prepare to launch the Haliade-X, the world's largest wind turbine. While Grid Solutions and hydro are difficult books of business, we're working through complex projects in improving our daily execution.","Now looking at our quarterly segment profit and margins. The four largest headwinds to margins were legacy Alstom projects, challenging onshore project execution in the Asia Pacific region, depreciation related largely to the onshore ramp and our NPIs and higher R&D spend. As you can see, combined, these were an impact of approximately 1,400 basis points. We're working very hard to offset these with strong volume and cost productivity, but there's more we must do.","In June, I spent a week with our Renewables leadership team. I left these meetings confident that we can grow this business profitably as legacy items run-off. We're taking action to improve operations. We're running our commercial efforts differently with tighter pricing controls led by the CFO. We're seeing traction as evidenced by positive pricing in the quarter, the first positive pricing we've seen in 10 quarters, and we believe pricing is stabilizing. We're also reducing cost, and improving on-time delivery.","In all, this can be and needs to be a better business than it is today. We have a large backlog of projects to deliver, and a healthy new product pipeline with solid returns coming over the next two to three years in both onshore and offshore. As we shared in our outlook call, we believe there's upside as we look to 2020 and 2021. This expectation remains.","So moving to slide 10. Let me first emphasize, the broader dynamics we discussed in our 2019 outlook. They remain largely unchanged. This is still a reset year. We're focused on execution at Power and returning the business to profitability. We see continued strength in our Aviation and Healthcare franchises.","At Renewable Energy, we're focused on delivering through the cycle. Non-operational items remain a cash headwind with more expected in the second half of the year. However, as we evaluate our performance year-to-date, updated for the reality of today and our expectations for the rest of the year, we are confident in the revised outlook.","You'll find our updated targets on the left side of the page. We've already discussed the change in free cash flow, which you now see as a negative $1 billion to a positive $1 billion. On organic Industrial segment revenues, we're up 6% year-to-date with a big second half ramp ahead of us in onshore wind and Aviation.","So now we're targeting mid-single-digit growth. On margins, our outlook is unchanged up, up to 100 basis points. While we were down 190 basis points in the first half, we expect the primary driver of upside in the second half to be the non-repeat of some of the 2018 charges, particularly in Gas Power.","On adjusted EPS, we are raising our guidance by $0.05 as we now have better line of sight to the total year profile, which includes some upside in interest. Lastly, on restructuring, our expected benefits remain unchanged. Both expense and cash this year will be lower. This is driven by timing related to certain projects. Attrition versus severance in some pockets has allowed us to reduce cost and executing on some projects at a lower cost than initially planned. We will continue to invest, but only when the economics makes sense. Looking to the second half as we discussed earlier, we are continuing to monitor our watch list items.","In summary, we made progress that we are encouraged about in the first half of the year, but it's early in a multiyear transformation. This is undoubtedly a game of inches. Across the organization, I see our team demonstrating candor, transparency and humility. They're engaged and focused on continuous operational improvement to achieve better results. The cultural shift is beginning to take hold as we are running GE differently. I saw this in our second quarter operating reviews during our lean week in Greenville and most recently during a two-week tour in Asia.","Looking forward, I'm confident in GE's long-term strengths, the size the strength and the nature of our installed base in viable markets where service and technology matter and our strong recurring revenue streams from parts and services. This allows us to get close \u2013 and stay close to our customers and continuously create value for them.","Before we take your questions, I'd like to take a minute and thank JoAnna Morris, who is retiring today after 42 years of faithful service. Many of you know Joanna well, and therefore, you also know her countless contributions to both GE's IR efforts and the broader industrial sector since she joined the IR team in 1990. It goes without saying JoAnna has seen it all. Her dedication to GE and our investment community over her tenure has been tireless. We wish her all the best of luck in her retirement.","JoAnna Morris","Thank you.","Larry Culp","With that, we'll open the line.","Steve Winoker","In the interest of fitting as many people as possible into Q&A on a busy earnings day as I know, we\u2019d ask that everyone limit themselves to one questions. With that, Brandon please open the line.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And from Vertical Research, we have Jeff Sprague. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And best of luck to JoAnna and Jamie. Thanks for all the help over the years.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Jeff.","JoAnna Morris","Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Hi, Larry. Just on cash flow to begin. Just thinking about Power cash flows, right? You've introduced flat in your guidance, right? We went from down to flat to down. I don't know where other people were at, but it was kind of my expectation that down in 2019 meant something equivalent or even worse to what we saw in 2018, negative $3 billion or so. Now that you've introduced flat it actually suggests we were kind of off the mark somewhere else in what we thought the segment cash flows might track at. I just wonder if there's something to be gleaned there? Is maybe Healthcare on the lighter side, or is it Aviation on MAX? And if you do manage a flat result here in Power in 2019 does it still hold that you'd expect Power cash flows to be down in 2020?","Larry Culp","Jeff, I think what we would say with respect to Power is that we have seen the stabilization that we referenced right with respect to the order book, which has been encouraging the improvements on both expense and cash performance, but we're going to include that potential for the year-on-year number to be flat, but it's still a flat to down range, right? There's still a lot of variability here.","To the extent that we are improving the range by $1 billion for the year, I think, it is appropriate to look at that and say that the bulk of that is coming out of the Power performance. There is some benefit from both the lower restructuring activity and the interest of course offset by MAX. But the reason we're maintaining that $2 billion range is because we're -- we still have work to do in Power, right? That's where we have the better part of the risk here.","I'd say with respect to the other segments, clearly as we've indicated we're -- all eyes are on MAX, but broadly, we're really not offering up much by way of change in 2019 for the rest of the segments. With respect to 2020, it's probably too early to really comment on any change in trajectory. But what we've said earlier in the year back in March on balance holds.","Operator","And from JPMorgan we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hi. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Hey, Steve. Good morning.","Steve Tusa","Congrats and best wishes to Jamie and JoAnna as well. On this -- just following up on this free cash flow guidance by segment. What is the kind of -- now that you're halfway through the year roughly the free cash flow for Healthcare embedded in the guide? Is that -- you said down. It was $3 billion last year. Should we think something in kind of that like $2.5 billion range, or is it -- is there kind of a range to put around that to help us with?","Larry Culp","No. I think with respect to Healthcare for purposes of today Steve no change in the Healthcare outlook from earlier in the year.","Operator","From Bank of America we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Good morning. Can you hear me?","Larry Culp","We can Andrew. Good morning. Go ahead, please.","Andrew Obin","Good morning. Also want to echo Steve's comments. Best wishes to Jamie and JoAnna. We'll miss you both. Just a question on Aviation. Free cash flow drag on Aviation $400 million. What has gotten worse? And the number seems to be quite a bit higher than what Safran is saying. And just want to confirm that $800 million in the second half is part of the free cash flow guidance.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So a couple of things. It was $300 million in the second quarter. In the second half, we do see that ramping to $400 million to the -- in each quarter while the plane is grounded. You know, remember LEAP volume is planned to ramp in the second half and that's really what that relates to is just simply that volume uptick in the second half. And then in terms of the overall outlook certainly we are monitoring that. It is embedded in the frame we talked about this morning though of the negative 1 to 1.","Operator","From Barclays we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. And wish also Jamie and JoAnna all the best. Maybe a question around Renewables. Help us understand, I guess, what kind of magnitude of EBIT loss for the year we should expect after a $400 million loss in the first half. And understood that the number is affected by the insertion of the grid business, which is loss-making. Maybe help us understand how your assumptions for the base renewable division ex-grid have changed if at all since March?","Jamie Miller","Yes, Julian, it's Jamie. When you look at Renewables in total with Grid included, I would just say -- repeat what I said in my prepared remarks, which is really that we expect our operating margin to be negative for the year. What we had said on legacy Renewables that it would be about breakeven in operating margin. And when you look at that there are certainly things we're monitoring there with respect to onshore wind deliveries, project execution and other elements that Larry and I both talked about on the call. And I think there could be a little bit of pressure to that zero for the full year but we see it hovering right around there.","Operator","From Melius Research we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jamie Miller","Hi, Scott","Jamie Miller","Good morning. ","Jamie Miller","Good morning. ","Scott Davis","I'll be the fifth person to wish Jamie and JoAnna well but it's been a lot of years.","Jamie Miller","Thank you.","Scott Davis","Particularly JoAnna thanks for your help over the years. It's been again a long time. But I wanted to go back to Power if you guys don't mind. And can you help us maybe Larry and Jamie get some granularity around this 2.5% margin number? I mean, what lingering impact of kind of cost of quality -- and I'll throw in like just crappy project execution in there and any other variable that you want to toss in there. Is there such a thing as kind of normalized if you fix this crap margin number that you could point to, or any granularity at all to help us bridge down to that 2.5%? Thanks.","Larry Culp","Yeah. Scott I think that, if Scott Strazik and his team were here, they would acknowledge fully that there's improvement potential throughout this business, right? And I just look at what I saw last week when we were in Atlanta for the operating review -- the July operating review. It was a stark contrast from a year ago.","With respect to new units, it's a competitive space. We're in some challenging geographies. But just in terms of the way the team today is looking at what we call the strike zone in terms of the deals that we want to pursue versus those that we don't, right, we're laying in a global level of standard work.","So we've got everybody looking at opportunities through the same lens. They were being sober about cost and contingencies. That's what sets up some of that project execution that you referred to a moment ago. And they're really driving in deeply to get to root cause, to understand where we've had some of these issues, be it around the selection of an EPC in and around the scope or the scheduling that we commit to the terms and conditions of course.","And I just think that while there is a good bit still to work through, we're writing a better book of business for the future. Hard to put a basis points contribution over time on that, but I think that's serious because that in turn is what sets up the project execution itself, right? Once we've won, we've got to see things through. And I've been really encouraged by the project review board the team's put in. We're getting in early in the life cycle of these commitments. It's a cross-functional effort really looking at what can go wrong and how do we mitigate, but also what can we improve for the customer or for you the shareholder. It's been helpful in managing handoffs and just getting the better daily management on the ground around the world.","Now we have a watch list of projects there, right? Probably -- I think it's about 35 in number of projects where we really have to be in the weeds on a daily basis to get after this. But I think that combination to me gives real encouragement that we can manage this business better with an eye toward margin expansion. Obviously, the real game though is in services and there's just similar opportunities there, right? We're not great in terms of our on-time delivery of parts and service. We're probably somewhere in the 75%, 80% range.","Get to root cause, we can fix that. Just the way that we're managing the selling function opportunities there in terms of our responsiveness, the specificity around what we do when we get a bid opportunity from a customer. So I don't think we're ready to say this is worth 50 basis points, this is worth 200. But hopefully that gives you a little bit of a flavor of what we can do to manage the business in addition to the restructuring and the other cost-out efforts to drive margins and better cash over time.","Jamie Miller","And Scott just to add a little bit to that, in the second quarter, we had just over $100 million of charges related to margin erosion in projects. I think what we're really looking at is few surprises this year. In the second half, certainly, we're monitoring all the different areas, but the operational actions that Larry talked about are really giving us a much deeper level of visibility into the project economics and the timing of our cash and the various actions we have to take.","And you probably remember last year in the second half we took significant charges at Power well over $1 billion. And when we look into the second half of this year that's how we'll really measure our own performance is not repeating those and certainly not repeating those to the same degree we had.","Operator","From Gordon Haskett, we have John Inch. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Good morning, and congrats JoAnna and Jamie.","Larry Culp","Hey.","John Inch","Good morning, everyone.","Larry Culp","Good morning, John.","Jamie Miller","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, guys. So I want to put a finer point around the MAX just so that I'm understanding what you're saying. So the flat guide of -- I'm sorry the down one -- I'm sorry, let me take a step back. The MAX is going to drag kind of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. Is that in your number? And then you are sort of flattish number or the up number territory for next year. Does that assume the MAX is flying? And then does Boeing make you whole when it starts to fly? There's a comment that it makes customers or suppliers whole. Does it also make you whole so you get all of this money back in terms of what the drag is?","Jamie Miller ","Yeah, John. The impact I talked about before is in our guide. And when the aircraft starts delivering again on -- when Boeing delivers the airframers, we will get paid for those engines. It's just a delay in cash timing.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning. And thanks Jamie and JoAnna. Good luck with your next stage. And I'm glad that JoAnna made a scene on the guide up by the way before she goes on. So on the -- just want to kind of pick up the thread on the MAX here. So I mean Boeing's put out the possibility that rate could come down further from 42. Can you just maybe give us -- I'm not looking here for decimal points, but if you could give us some sense on how that influences the free cash flow outlook and also the margin impact. So I'm assuming that there would be some margin pressure if we have less variable contribution from engine production. So any sense on how that would impact free cash flow and earnings from rate reduction on the MAX? Thank you.","Larry Culp","Nigel, at this point as I think we've all communicated we're at a lower level of production than we thought we would be at this point in the year for obvious reasons. And all we're really trying to signal with the $400 million of cash pressure here in the back half -- $400 million per quarter is -- what is likely to happen if we do not see a return to service.","So we just tried to simplify that without getting into trying to get ahead of Boeing or the FAA or other regulators with respect to when the plane is going to return to service, and again really refraining from any commentary in terms of what could change in terms of our trajectory going into 2020. But clearly we're doing all we can to support Boeing and our carrier customers to facilitate a safe return to service for the MAX.","Operator","And from RBC Capital Markets we have Deane Dray. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and my congrats to JoAnna and all the best to Jamie. I was hoping to ask a couple of macro questions if I could. You all would be one of the only industrials not to comment or complain about some short cycle pressures and where and how might that be manifested in the results today. Some comments on geographies especially China. It looked like Healthcare did better there. And then true us up on tariffs, $300 million to $500 million was the last update?","Larry Culp","Dean, I think as we went through the reviews here in July right looking back to the second quarter, looking ahead to the second half there wasn't a lot of finger pointing at short cycle pressure. We certainly saw bits of the business that didn't perform at the top line in the way that we would have liked.","I think the Healthcare revenues were a little soft in the U.S. and in China. I think we touched briefly on the gas service business. But I think we really look at that more frankly as a function of our own execution as opposed to short cycle pressure that we can point to.","I think we want to be vigilant but clearly going into the second half with the backlog and the visibility that we've referenced a few times here I think we felt good enough to tick up the revenue guide to that mid single digit range.","With respect to China, as I mentioned I was there as part of a two-week trip to Asia. I would say that the embrace of GE is strong at the customer level. At the government level, GE is seen as a key partner. We signed as you may have seen; I think an important offshore wind commitment in Guangdong province while we were there.","As you would expect we had some key meetings with our Gas Power partner Harbin. I do think having partners is going to be key going forward in China. And I'm glad we're partnered up with Harbin.","But the trade tensions there are real. And you don't have to look past today's headlines to have that, I think is a watch item. And how that plays out for our book of business in China, how it plays out more broadly for all of us is a bit unclear.","I think we've tried to take in some of that pressure into account in the back half here. But we flagged it just given it's a variable, good bit outside of our control.","Jamie Miller","And just on China tariffs the impact in the second quarter was $90 million net and really no change. I think we've said $400 million to $500 million of net impact for this year and that's about what we still see, mostly in Healthcare and Renewables.","Deane Dray","Thanks Steve.","Operator","From Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning guys, best of luck, to JoAnn and Jamie.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning. ","Andrew Kaplowitz","Obviously, good improvement in execution in Power, but maybe you could talk about the markets, pretty strong orders so far, above your expectations. Is that more a result of your teams getting their act together, or are you seeing some improvement in some of the major regions that you do business regions of North America, Middle East Asia?","Larry Culp","Well, I think the team is doing a better job, certainly, but again, it's very early right. Whether we're talking about the top line, the bottom-line the cash, I don't want to -- I don't want any of this to sound like we are claiming victory.","I think Scott and the team are focused again on a high-quality book of business. The share numbers will be what they are. But I think over time what we want to do is, partner with the right customers, in and around the opportunities that allow us to create value for them. And in turn value for our shareholders over the life cycle of that commitment.","Clearly, as you well know the gas business is different region by region. But I would just share briefly. Whether it was in Japan, whether it was in Singapore, obviously in China, on this last trip I visited, a site under construction in Malaysia, there's a lot of keen interest in adding gas capacity as they work through, not only their own underlying economic growth but the energy transition.","So, we're bullish on that part of the world, with respect to the gas business. We need to be better in terms of the book of business. We need to be better at project execution back to Scott's question. And then, all of the details inherent in sustaining a good service business over the life cycle of those installations.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning and best wishes to Jamie and JoAnna. So I guess, I want to focus a little bit on GE Capital. It's been a source of upside versus expectations year-to-date.","Do you still expect GE Capital to generate a $500 million to $800 million loss for the full year? And I guess what's driving the delta between one half and two half performance if so?","Jamie Miller","Yeah. So, GE Capital's continuing net income for the first half was $46 million negative $89 million in the quarter. A lot of that is helped by timing of asset sales. In the second quarter we had EFS gains. The GECAS elements were also more first half loaded.","When you look at the quarter in particular lower interest expense, the tax audit resolution those things helped us. And when you pull back and look at first half\/second half. I think you're going to still be impacted by timing. So, we are first half loaded on gains. You'll see that come back a bit in second half.","In the third quarter we do our loss recognition testing for insurance. In addition, we have our GECAS impairment testing. And the timing of this tax resolution in the second quarter we did not expect that in the second quarter. We really expected that in the second half.","So, we still expect to be within that negative $500 million to negative $800 million, absent the LRT probably at the higher end of that. But on the LRT, we'll update you in the third quarter when that's complete.","Operator","From Credit Suisse, we have John Walsh. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning, John.","JoAnna Morris","Good morning.","John Walsh","And I'll echo everyone's well wishes for Jamie and JoAnna. Appreciate the help. So I guess, maybe following off of Andy's question on Power. I mean I think you're clearly making good progress in Power right around what you can control within GE. You've made investments right on H-frame for kind of more baseload power.","But as I look at the market, right, I mean battery storage rate is a potential technology disruption there particularly around peakers. And I don't want to go specifically down that road necessarily, but as you're focusing on improving the margins, can you talk to what you're doing to also play offense, particularly within Power whether it's around your R&D investments or other investments the business is making to prepare for technology shifts that will continue to happen over time?","Larry Culp","Sure, sure. Well, I would say, you probably see it in a few areas, John. I think that clearly as we see the transition from coal and nuclear to other sources -- cleaner more efficient sources, gas is a beneficiary in that, right? So we're just again trying to make sure that we're plugged in country-by-country, customer-by-customer, where we can be part of that.","You're right in certain places, gas will be used differently, and that will shape our product road map in terms of the types of upgrades that we offer as well as the new unit NPI journey over time.","I'd also say that, with respect to storage and other opportunities that we might have, tucked away ever so discreetly on the Renewables page in the prepared remarks is a reference to hybrids, where what we've done is we've put our solar inverter in our battery storage efforts.","And these are small they're nascent, but they really are our opportunities to play here in the renewables, because we see opportunities in and around the wind business, particularly to lever our technology installed base in a broader way.","We don't talk a lot about that. We had a good session with the team last week looking at some of the second half investments that we're going to make there, and hopefully over time that will be more significant. But I would really say big picture making sure we've got a best-in-class gas business during the energy transition while continuing to invest largely in our onshore and offshore wind businesses is the way we are positioning ourselves for the energy transition.","Steve Winoker","Brandon, we have time for just one more given we\u2019re pass the top of the hour. So let\u2019s take our last question please, one more.","Operator","Our last question from Goldman Sachs we have Joe Ritchie on line. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning, and congratulations Jamie, JoAnna.","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Joe.","Steve Winoker","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","And so, thanks for fitting me in. And just I guess my one question. You guys monetized your stake or a portion of your stake in Wabtec this quarter. Can you just remind us of any of the restrictions or plans that you have for your remaining stake both in Wabtec and for BHGE?","Jamie Miller","So from a Wabtec perspective, there is a restriction that lasts into this fall. And on the Baker Hughes side, we are free to sell down at anytime those subscriptions that we have at this point. But we continue to expect an orderly process with both.","Operator","And no further questions at this time. Mr. Winoker, closing remarks?","Steve Winoker","No. I think we're good and available for calls with our team. Thanks everybody.","Larry Culp","Thanks everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings webcast. We issued the press release, presentation, and supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes.","For today\u2019s webcast, we have Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; Vice Chairman and CEO of GE Capital, Keith Sherin; and our CFO, Jeff Bornstein.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Matt, and good morning everyone. The GE team had a good quarter and a slow growth in volatile environment. Organic performance was strong, and industrial revenue growth was up 4%, profit was up 9%, year-to-date industrial CFOA is up 23%, and industrial segment margins were up 100 basis points.","Let me make a few comments on we\u2019re seeing our markets more broadly. The U.S. is still okay and Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are facing some headwinds in resource pricing and currency. Nonetheless, we\u2019re positioned to win some big fourth quarter deals in these markets in locomotives and power, aviation, and power conversion, which should support our growth objectives; and service provides a great buffer in times of uncertainty.","We made substantial progress on GE\u2019s portfolio transformation in the quarter. Alstom has been approved by the European Commission and we expect this to close soon. The Fed has approved the Synchrony separation, and we expect to commence the share exchange next week. The net effect of this should be to return about $20 billion to investors in the form of share reduction.","Our GE Capital portfolio sales are ahead of plan; and with the Wells announcement, we now expect 2015 signings of $140 billion to $150 billion. And we believe this will facilitate an incremental dividend from GE Capital of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter or $3 billion for the year. So if you look at our execution, we\u2019re tracking to meet or beat all of our critical goals. We\u2019re reconfirming our earnings outlook that we gave in the second quarter, when we boosted the low end of our range. And our CFOA and cash return to investors will be at the high-end of our framework.","So Keith and I will now take you through a deeper dive on the portfolio moves. For Alstom, all the major regulators have now approved GE\u2019s purchase of Alstom with remedies. We\u2019re comfortable with the outcome as the economic and strategic impact of the deal remains intact. We will divest to Ansaldo the GT26 new units, and the GT36 technology, and 34 of 720 service contracts in the installed base.","We will retain the ability to do service for competitive units through PSM. Financially, we still expect to achieve $3 billion of synergies with $0.05 to $0.08 of earnings accretion in 2016 and $0.15 to $0.20 by 2018. Alstom grows GE\u2019s installed base by 50%. In addition, they will substantially improve our position in renewables and grid. Alstom will achieve a strong return for investors and we will give you more operating details on Alstom at a special meeting we plan to hold in late November.","Now over to Keith to give you an update on the GE Capital portfolio moves.","Keith Sherin","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. As Jeff mentioned, we have received formal approval from the Federal Reserve to move forward with the split off of Synchrony Financial as a standalone company. This is the final step in a project which we started two years ago and is a key component in the transformation of GE Capital.","We can\u2019t talk about the specific financial terms of this exchange until we launch. However to provide some context on the left side of the page, we show the timeline and mechanics for the exchange. We plan to launch the split exchange next week subject to market conditions. The offer period remains open for 20 business days from the time of launch. And at launch, we\u2019re going to set the offer terms for the exchange, meaning the split discount that holders will receive on Synchrony stock when they exchange their GE shares plus the exchange cap ratio, which is the maximum discount between GE and Synchrony shares set at the time of the launch.","The pricing for the split exchange will happen on days 16 to 18, and the offer closes on day 20, which would occur the week of November 16. Based on precedents from other exchanges that have taken place and the current stock prices of GE and Synchrony, we anticipate to receive proceeds of between $18 billion and $21 billion, which translate to a buyback of 650 million to 750 million shares in GE.","The range in outcomes is determined by the split discount, the exchange ratio, and the movement of GE and Synchrony shares prior to and during the exchange up to pricing. We anticipate that we\u2019ll record a gain in GE Capital in discontinued operations and that gain, the size of which is dependent on the final split discount will be embedded in the proceeds for the buyback, so we\u2019ll not have any impact on GECC Capital ratios. I really like to thank Margaret Keane and her team for the terrific work they\u2019ve done to position Synchrony for this separation. In the next 30.days, we plan to retire 6% to 7% of GE shares.","Next, I\u2019ll give you an update on our progress executing the plan that we announced on April 10th. On the top left of this chart is an update on the portfolio sales. We are ahead of plan. And in the first six months since the announcement, we\u2019ve signed deals on $126 billion worth of ENI. Since 2Q, we\u2019ve signed $58 billion worth of transactions, the largest being the $30 billion sale of our distribution finance, vendor finance, and direct lending businesses to Wells Fargo, which we announced earlier this week.","We gave previous guidance that we would sign $120 billion to $150 billion of deals by year-end, and we\u2019re now raising the low end of that range to $140 billion given the progress we\u2019ve made. We have closed $60 billion of sales to date, and we\u2019re on track to close $100 billion by year-end. On the bottom left, you can see our current view versus the goals that we established back on April 10. We\u2019re ahead of plan on asset sales and we expect to largely be done with our exits by year-end 2016 instead of 2017.","Overall, we\u2019re on track to deliver the $35 billion of capital back to the parent. You can see on the top right that our pricing to date on the $126 billion is slightly ahead of plan at 1.4 times price to tangible book. And the deal that we announced with Wells earlier this week was also at approximately 1.4 times price to tangible book.","As a result of the accelerated sales, we are giving up some of the future income from the total plan. But overall, with our asset and liability management actions, including the debt exchange that we completed, our current estimate of capital to be returned is still $35 billion. In terms of timing of dividends, as we close sales transactions in the fourth quarter, we expect our Tier 1 common ratio to exceed 14%, and we plan to pay a dividend of approximately $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter subject to our governance process. That would result in $3 billion for 2015, which is $2 billion higher than the original plan.","In addition, we\u2019re on track for $18 billion of dividends that we previously said would come in 2016. Our goal is to apply for SIFI de-designation, which based on our view of transaction closings, our target is to file in the first quarter of 2016. If you combine the Synchrony split with the 2015 transaction closings, we expect to end 2015 with around $175 billion of ENI around $200 billion lower than year end 2014. I really like to thank the GE Capital employees who have accomplished a lot in the last six months, and the team is focused on substantially completing the business exits by the end of 2016.","Let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Keith. And now I\u2019ll briefly go through GE\u2019s industrial operations. Year-to-date orders are down 4% organically. We faced some tough comps in orders compared to third quarter 2014, when total orders grew by 22%, and equipment orders grew by 31%. Organically, developed markets are up 18% year-to-date with growth markets down 7% excluding a large one-time GE9X order. Our year-to-date orders in China are up 1%. Service grew by 6% organically, and our progress was broad-based. PowerGen services grew by 10%, aviation spares grew by 28%, and healthcare was up by 4% organically.","Power and water, energy management, and healthcare orders were up 9% organically. However, aviation and transportation has significant one-time orders placed in the third quarter of 2014 with GE9X and Tier 4. These two products alone had $6 billion of orders in the third quarter of 2014. Oil and gas orders reflect the impact of industry dynamics. Our organic orders decline was 32% and is not unexpected.","We continue to compete well in the market and have not seen cancellations. Importantly, there are substantial equipment orders where we\u2019ve been selected technically, but they have been delayed. So we\u2019re confident in our market position. Across the company, we have a strong funnel of orders for the fourth quarter and we expect our orders performance to improve.","On execution, the GE team executed very well in the quarter. Organic revenue growth was up 4% with six of seven segments up. Our relative position both in product and geographic diversity has never been stronger. Globally, revenue in the U.S. was up 5%, and Europe organic growth was up substantially, while growth markets declined by 7%. Year-to-date revenue was positive in ASEAN, China, Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America, and Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile, reasons like Russia, Canada, and Australia have been hard hit by natural resource dynamics.","Services were up 8% organically. Growth for software and analytics was up 16%, gaining momentum from our digital investments. At minds and machines, we launched Predix, and now have more than 20,000 developers. We\u2019re expanding partnerships with important customers like Boeing, Exelon, and BP. Service growth was broad-based with power up 9%, aviation up 17%, transportation up 10%, and healthcare up 3% organically.","We\u2019re winning with new products. The H-Turbine has 67 technical selections with 21 in backlog. Power conversion revenue grew by 15% behind multiple new product launches. Our aviation engines are achieving market leadership by meeting customer commitments with superior execution. We now have 10,000 LEAP engines in backlog. Life sciences had 8% organic growth in the quarter. And we have two important wins for bioprocess manufacturing in China.","We launched Current as a way to capitalize on 72% LED growth and the opportunity to build a strong presence in the C&I energy efficiency space. Margins continue to be a great GE story. Segment op margins grew 100 basis points with growth in gross margins of 80 basis points and we\u2019ve expanded our value gap by $300 million year-to-date and expect this to continue. Our product margins are expanding, and the analytics continue to drive productivity and services. Restructuring is delivering substantial benefits and, in all, we think our margins can continue to grow. This is our tenth straight quarter of margin expansion, so we have real momentum.","I would like to highlight the work of our oil and gas team as a good example of our execution. In a tough environment with organic revenue declining by 7%, they grew margins by 100 basis points organically and held earnings. This will position them well in a volatile industry. Now cash is also a good story for the year. Industrial CFOA is up 23% year-to-date. Industrial free cash flow is up 53%, and as is typical we expect a strong fourth quarter where we expect a $2 billion reduction in working capital similar to last year.","The great portfolio execution mentioned by Keith will allow for upside in our cash performance. Based on accelerated progress in capital asset sales, we should be able to dividend an additional $2.5 billion to the parent in the fourth quarter, and this would be $3 billion for the year. This will put the company at the high end of our CFOA range. In an effective Synchrony execution should return about $20 billion to investors through a share exchange. And this will put us about $30 billion of cash returned to investors for the year through dividend and buyback.","We still expect appliances to close in the quarter. This is not a complicated transaction. Appliances is a highly competitive industry with at least seven manufacturers and 21 brands. Electrolux wants to close and is working hard to do so. So the GE balance sheet is very strong and we will finish the year with substantial liquidity.","And now over to Jeff to go through operations.","Jeff Bornstein","Great, thanks Jeff. I\u2019ll start with the third quarter summary. We had revenues of $31.7 billion, which were down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues including corporate were down 2% to $25.8 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.29, up 16% year-over-year, with industrial up 9%, and the verticals up 50%. Operating EPS number of $0.32 adds in other continuing GE Capital activity including the consumer segment, headquarter run-off and other exit related items, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail on the GE Capital page.","Continuing EPS of $0.28 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS $0.25 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact for the quarter was a negative $347 million, which included $1 billion of exit related non-cash charges. These charges are within the framework of $23 billion exit impact that we communicated in April. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with operations in CLL and real estate, which will move to disc ops earlier in the year.","As Jeff said, we generated $6.5 billion of CFOA year-to-date, which was down 9% driven by lower GE Capital dividends. However, industrial CFOA was $6.1 billion year-to-date, up 23%. The GE tax rate was 17%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 20%, which is in line with our current estimate for the total year rate. The GE Capital reported rate was a negative 6% in the quarter, which includes tax benefits associated with the plan to shrink GE Capital. The vertical tax rate was 0%. As we communicated previously, as we complete the GE Capital restructuring, we expect the verticals tax rate to be low double-digits.","On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but up 4% organically, reflecting about 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was $1.2 billion drag on industrial segment revenue and $165 million impact on industrial segment op profit. Despite this headwind, industrial segment operating profit was up 5%, and organically the industrial segments were up 9%. GE Capital Vertical earnings of $351 million in the quarter were up 55%.","Next I\u2019ll go through the earnings walk. Consistent with last quarter we included a walk of the different elements of our earnings so that the dynamics are clear, given all the moving pieces with GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, industrial operating net income was $2.6 billion and vertical income was $351 million for a total industrial plus verticals operating earnings up $2.9 billion. The GE Capital consumer segment earned $795 million during the quarter, which I\u2019ll cover later.","On the other GE Capital line, we incurred $411 million of cost, driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter run-off, operating expenses, and excess interest. As a result, total operating earnings were $3.3 billion. Including non-operating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.9 billion. Discontinued operations were a charge of $347 million, which I discussed on the previous page. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were $2.5 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS numbers and the variance versus prior year.","Next page, on one-times, we had $0.02 of charges related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were $346 million on a pre-tax basis, and $244 million after-tax. About 45% of those charges related to restructuring in our oil and gas business, as we continue to execute on our cost-out program. We had no industrial gains in the quarter.","On the bottom of the page, you can see the fourth quarter estimate. We\u2019re expecting gains from appliances signaling and embedded systems transactions in the quarter. For the year, we continue to expect gains in restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis. We\u2019ve increased our expected restructuring from $0.11 to about $0.14 due to the higher gains we expect for the year. We have additional attractive restructuring opportunities including Alstom, which will offset the higher gains.","Now, I\u2019ll go through each of the segments, starting with power and water. Orders in the quarters were up 8% and up 13% organically. Equipment orders were up 7% to $3.5 billion on strength in distributed power higher by 61%, renewables up 2% partly offset by thermal down 6%. Distributed power was higher driven by two fast track power deals in Indonesia and Ghana, and our first order for six LM6000 PF+ units in Thailand. The new LM6000 PF+ attains 56 combined-cycle efficiencies, which is the highest in its class. It takes half the time to install versus its predecessor and can startup to full power in about 10 minutes.","Renewables orders were up 2%, up 14% excluding FX on strong international orders. Unit volumes were lower at 821 versus 839 a year ago, but megawatts were up 9%. Thermal orders were down 6%, down 2% in ex-FX. We took orders for 22 gas turbines versus 23 last year. The business booked 4 H orders in the quarter: two in Pakistan, one in Korea, and one in the U.S. This brings our total H units in backlog to 21, with an additional 47 technical ones, a seven-unit increase from the second quarter.","Service orders grew 8% to $3.4 billion, driven by strength in PGS, up 10%. We continue to see success in our upgrade campaigns including AGPs, drive load, NOCs, Op Flex, all of which enhance the performance of our machines. In the quarter, we booked 22 AGPs, up four from the third quarter of last year. Revenues in the quarter were up 1%, and higher by 7% organically. Equipment revenue was down 6% driven by thermal down 10% on 16 gas turbines shipments versus 26 a year ago. And distributed power was down 30% on lower engine volume, principally driven by weak demand in the gas compression market.","Renewables revenues were up 8%, and up 19% excluding exchange, on higher shipments of 735 wind turbines versus 642 last year. Service revenues were strong, up 9%, led by PGS, up 13%, driven principally by upgrade sales. AGPs totaled 22 in the quarter versus 18 a year ago. Op profit was higher by 7% and up 10% organically. Margins improved 100 basis points driven by service growth and cost productivity. As we look to the fourth quarter, no change to the framework we\u2019ve given you on gas turbines and distributed power. Wind is turning to the low end of the range we had given you previously of 3,000 to 3,200 turbines.","Next oil and gas, the business continues to perform in a very difficult environment. Orders in the quarter were down 38% and down 32% organically. All segments saw lower orders given the constrained CapEx environment and project delays. Equipment orders were down 60% with TMS down 57% driven by a large Canadian LNG push-out. Subsea was down 81% with softness in both drilling and well stream. Downstream was down 58%, surface was down 49% on lower rig counts, and M&C was down 22% on softness in flow and process technology.","Service orders for the quarter were down 13%, but down 4% organically, principally driven by subsea and surface, down 26% and 39% respectively. And that was partially offset by TMS, which was up 4%, and up 20% organically on higher installations. Backlog in the third quarter ended at $22.3 billion, down 7% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were down 16% to $3.9 billion and down 7% organically. Foreign exchange had a $400 million impact on revenue. Equipment revenues were down 18% and down 8% organically, driven by surface down 36% and subsea lower by 12%, down 3% ex-foreign exchange. Organically, TMS was down 3%, and downstream was up 12%. Service revenues were down 14% and down 5% organic with M&C down 2%. ","Op profit was lower by 12% versus last year and flat organically. Foreign exchange was a $75 million headwind in the quarter. The business continues to execute on cost and material inflation. Value gap was positive with a very modest price impact. Margins improved 70 basis points and 100 basis points excluding the effects of exchange. Through three quarters, revenues are down 13% and down 4% organically. Operating profit is down 10% reported and up 5% organically. We expect volume pressure to persist into the fourth quarter. However, given the strong execution on cost-out, we believe that for total year organic op profit will be about flat year-over-year or slightly better versus the flat to down 5% guidance we provided earlier.","The team is making strong progress on achieving the $600 million of cost-out goal for 2015 and is well positioned to deliver $1 billion plus cumulatively of cost-out through 2016. In aviation, underlying travel demand continues to grow robustly, higher by 6.6% year-to-date August with strength domestically and internationally. The Middle East and Asia Pacific continue to be particularly strong. Air freight volumes grew 2.6% through August. Orders in the third quarter of $6.5 billion were down 35%. The third quarter of 2014 included large orders received at the Farnborough Air Show.","Equipment orders were down 58% driven by commercial orders. Last year, we booked $3.8 billion of GE9X orders versus $600 million of GE99X orders this quarter. GEnx orders of $600 million were up three times, driven by strength in China and we had $800 million of LEAP CFM orders in the quarter. Commercial engines backlog of just under $30 billion is higher by 22% versus last year. Military orders were down significantly on non-repeat of international campaigns last year and soft U.S. demand.","Services were very strong. Service orders grew 13% on strong commercial spares growth, up 28% at $39.5 million a day. Military services were higher by 76%. This was partly offset by overhaul volume being down. Revenue in the quarter was up 5% to $6 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6%, with commercial down and military down 20%. We shipped 64 GEnx units versus 65 last year, and services revenue was up 17%, with commercial spares higher by 22% and military up 16%. ","Operating profit was up 7% driven by strong services volume and value gap. Margins expanded 30 basis points in the quarter. So solid quarter from the Aviation team. The LEAP testing and performance remains on track, with the first installs expected to be in service in mid-2016. ","Next up is Healthcare. Orders of $4.5 billion were down 4% reported, but up 3% organically. Geographically the U.S. was down 1%; Europe was up strongly ex-foreign-exchange by 11% and down 5% reported; China was flat; and the Middle East grew 15%. In terms of product lines, Healthcare systems orders were down 7%, but up 1%, ex-foreign-exchange. In the U.S., orders were up 2%, driven by strength in CT and MR, which were higher by 10% and 15%, respectively, partially offset by weak x-ray. ","The U.S. appears to have performed in line with the market. Europe was strong again, up 7% organically. That\u2019s the fifth consecutive quarter of positive organic growth for us in Europe. The Middle East grew 22%. China was down 40% as orders continue to be impacted by lower public tenders. The private-sector orders are growing at double-digit rates in China, but off a much smaller base than the public market. Life Sciences orders grew 11% organically and 4% reported. Bioprocess grew 23% excluding FX, with very strong demand in Europe, up 42%, and in China, up 162%. ","Healthcare revenues were down 5% in the quarter; up 2% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Healthcare systems was up 1% and Life Sciences grew 8%, excluding FX. Operating profit in the quarter was down 10%, and down 4% organically. Negative leverage was driven by lower value gap and higher new product spend, which more than offset the cost productivity in the business. Margins contracted 90 basis points in the quarter. ","The third quarter was impacted by lower than expected volume in the growth markets and accelerated new product spend to drive future growth. The business has seen strong customer interest in productivity analytics and as a result has accelerated their migration to the Predix platform and development of productivity applications. In the fourth quarter, we expect this level of higher product investment to continue. We expect growth markets to remain challenging and developed markets to continue to show positive organic growth. In Transportation, North American carloads were down 2.2%, primarily driven by lower coal and petroleum, down about 9%. That was partly offset by 2% intermodal growth. Year-to-date rail volume is down about 1%. Orders in the quarter were down 77% or about $3 billion, as we expected, driven by locomotives. ","In the third quarter of 2014, we took a 3-fold increase or about 1,100 units in orders for Tier 4. 2014 large-order intake combined with the current global commodity cycle is pressuring demand for increment of locomotive power. However, we are working on several large opportunities and expect fourth-quarter locomotive orders to be much stronger. Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, driven by services up 10%. Locomotive equipment revenues are up 11%, partially offset by mining.","Operating profit was up 11% driven by volume, productivity, and deflation, more than offsetting Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved 160 basis points. In Energy Management, orders of $2.1 billion were up 2%, and up 8% organically, driven by strength in Renewables and our Power Conversion business, which grew orders 16%, up 26% organically. Power Conversions Renewable orders were up over 4 times on deals won in conjunction with both GE and Alstom, which offset the weak Oil & Gas Marine segment. Digital Energy orders were up 20%, and Industrial Solutions was down 13%. ","Revenues in the quarter were down 2% reported, but up 6% exchange. Organically, Power Conversion was up 15%, Digital Energy was up 8%, and Industrial Solutions was flat. Operating profit was higher by more than 2 times to $127 million in the quarter. Higher earnings driven by strong cost productivity and value gap partly offset by negative FX. Margins improved 390 basis points in the quarter. In Appliances & Lighting, for the segment, revenues grew 8% in the quarter with Appliances up 10% on strong volume and Lighting up 5%. ","The U.S. appliance industry was up 8%, with retail up 9% and contract up 7%. Lighting continued to grow LEDs. LED revenue grew 65%, partially offset by 15% decline in traditional products. LEDs now account for 39% of Lighting revenue, up from 25% a year ago. Op profit in the quarter was up 88%, driven by material deflation and cost productivity. ","Next I\u2019ll cover GE Capital. Our Vertical businesses earned $351 million this quarter; that\u2019s up 55% from prior year, driven by transactional gains and lower annual impairments in our Aviation business, partially offset by Oil & Gas impairments in our Energy business. Portfolio quality remained stable, and GECAS finished the quarter with zero delinquencies and no AOGs. Working down the page, Consumer earned $795 million during the quarter, up 28% on gains related to portfolio exits from the international platform, partially offset by Synchrony minority interest. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $493 million. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will hold Synchrony\u2019s earnings call later today. ","As Keith covered, we received approval from the Federal Reserve to proceed with the Synchrony separation and intend to launch the share exchange next week, subject to market conditions. GE Capital Corporate generated a $411 million loss in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit-related tax and restructuring charges, excess interest expense and headquarters operating costs. Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $347 million loss, driven by a $1 billion noncash charge associated with the execution of our portfolio exit strategy, partially offset by operating results in the underlying businesses. These charges are in line with the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April. ","Overall, GE Capital reported $387 million of earnings, and we ended the quarter with $176 billion of continuing ENI, excluding liquidity. The Verticals ended the quarter with $78 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. Our liquidity levels remain strong, and we ended the quarter with $97 billion, including $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. As part of GE Capital\u2019s internal reorganization, we launched a debt exchange to capitalize our international entity and to better align our assets and liabilities from a maturity and liquidity perspective. ","The exchange was oversubscribed, and we accepted $36 billion of new bonds, which were price on October 5; and we\u2019ll settle the transactions on October 26. Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 13.7%, which is up 230 basis points from the second quarter. We expect to achieve 14% Tier 1 common ratio by year-end, inclusive of the additional $2.5 billion dividend that Keith mentioned previously. ","Just some highlights on the right-hand side of the page. The Verticals are on track to deliver $1.5 billion of earnings in 2015. Asset sales are ahead of plan, with $126 billion signed and $60 billion closed. Once completed the Synchrony exchange will trigger the Consumer segment to move to discontinued operations. Given our significant progress, we plan to apply for SIFI de-designation in the first quarter of 2016. In the last six months, Keith and the GE Capital team have continued to deliver operationally and are well ahead of the plan on the portfolio transformation we shared with you in April. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Jeff. Just to conclude, we have a few updates on the operating framework. We\u2019ve kept the Industrial EPS expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. If Appliances close, we will be closer to the high end of this range; and our execution on our organic growth, margins, and corporate costs remain strong. We expect the GE Capital Verticals to be at least $0.50, with more strength in GECAS. Capital asset sales should be at least $100 billion, with more coming in the first quarter. CFOA should be about $16 billion. And free cash flows plus divestitures would be about $15 billion assuming that Appliances closes. ","And we expect to return $30 billion to investors, about, reflecting the impact of Synchrony. GE is executing on its investor commitments and is on track for its 2015 goals. Our portfolio transformation is happening at an unprecedented pace. We have a focused infrastructure business with leading positions in our markets, and we\u2019re positioned to grow faster than our competitors, with a strong dividend. We\u2019re growing operating and gross profit margins and making Corporate smaller. We have nearly a $200 billion backlog of services that positions the Company well for any cycle, and we\u2019re transforming GE into the world\u2019s premier digital industrial company, in a unique position to drive outcomes for customers and grow margins. ","I\u2019d like to take a moment to acknowledge the work of the GE team. Last quarter we completed our largest Industrial acquisition, completely repositioned GE Capital, and launched one of the largest-ever IPOs. At the same time, we\u2019re winning in the market and delivering strong financial results. I\u2019m very proud of their work. ","Now, Matt, back to you for questions.","Matt Cribbins","Thanks, Jeff. Lots to talk about. Let\u2019s open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys. Is there a sense, Jeff \u2013 and either Jeff I guess. But Jeff Immelt, is there a sense with the fall-off you\u2019ve seen in orders that there is any risk we are entering a bit of an industrial recession, particularly as it relates to growth markets?","Jeff Immelt","So, you know, Scott, what I would say, kind of going around the world, is U.S. gets a little bit better every day. Europe is appreciably better. Meanwhile, growth markets are highly differentiated in terms of their performance and have some headwinds as it pertains to oil prices and things like that. On balance, Scott, we see as much activity as we\u2019ve ever seen. The quoting activity, the deal activity, things like that, is still quite robust. Business for us in China is still pretty good, which is a big market. And so we still see a fair amount of opportunities out there, even amongst the volatility. So, I really believe that we can still accomplish our long-term goals in the world we see today. And then I would just remind you that we\u2019ve got $200 billion backlog of services; it\u2019s 70% or 80% of our earnings. It\u2019s growing organically 8%. So we\u2019ve got a pretty robust underpinning of the total Company as we go forward. But the quote activity is as robust today as it was six months ago or a year ago. ","Scott Davis","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then it\u2019s a little bit of a strange question, but those of us who have followed you guys for a long time have seen, I think, a higher sense of urgency or at least an execution level that\u2019s been pretty high in the last year or so. Like you said, in the last six quarters you have beaten your margin targets or so. What do you attribute? I mean you had a big change in compensation structure that kicked in, in January. I mean, are we seeing just the benefit of past investments kind of pulling through? And how do you think about at least, how do you attribute really this higher level of execution and how GE is different today maybe than it was just three years ago?","Jeff Immelt","So I would say, Scott, I would say again \u2013 great team. The compensation plan clearly helps. I think we made the investments three or four or five years ago that are helping us today in product lines and globalization and things like that. I mean, we don\u2019t \u2013 we have as robust of an NPI pipeline as we\u2019ve ever had, and we\u2019re not dependent on any one country. We\u2019ve got a very diversified country mix. That\u2019s some of the stuff that John Rice had done. The last thing I would say, Scott, is look, there\u2019s no way to describe what it feels like to run GE where the team knows exactly what it has to do over the next three years. ","I mean our plan \u2013 we can\u2019t guarantee exactly what the macro environment\u2019s going to be. But between the GE Capital actions, buying back stock, organic growth, integrating Alstom, you\u2019ve got a leadership team that knows precisely what we need to do for investors over the next three years. And that is a place we haven\u2019t been in certainly since the financial crisis. That I think just helps everybody. It helps people who own the stock, and it gives the leadership team, I think, extra momentum as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. ","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Deane. ","Deane Dray","Hey, I had been thinking it might be too early to ask about some specifics for your Oil & Gas outlook for 2016, but you did just disclose the cost-out plan and the increase to cumulative to $1 billion there. So hopefully you can share some of your assumptions, maybe getting as granular as revenues and op profit for Oil & Gas next year.","Jeff Immelt","So, you know, Deane, I would say in that it\u2019s a market that is so visible and volatile, I think I\u2019d start by reflecting a little bit on what we\u2019ve done this year. The team I think in a very tough environment has gotten after the costs, has executed in the market, has driven services. So I think you\u2019d say, if you reflect back on where we were in the fourth quarter last year and then where we sit today, I think our Oil & Gas team has done a fantastic job as it pertains to this year.","And then I think if we look forward and just \u2013 we don\u2019t assume that the market gets appreciably better. We would say that revenue might be down 10% to 15% next year and that operating profit might be down 10% to 15% next year, and that we hold margins in a tougher environment. And that\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s the kind of feel that we have. And again, we still want to go through and do all of our normal fourth quarter planning on the company, but I just think it\u2019s important to investors to have some visibility in terms of how we think about Oil & Gas and triangulating backlog and things like that.","Deane Dray","And just to clarify that 10% to 15%, that\u2019s an organic number?","Jeff Immelt","Yes, right\u2026","Deane Dray","All right.","Jeff Immelt","Yes, yes.","Deane Dray","Good. And then related to Oil & Gas, and you mentioned going back to the fourth quarter when oil was really still in a freefall \u2013 at the Outlook Meeting, Jeff, you said you could be opportunistic in looking at assets in Oil & Gas. And would love to hear what your thinking is today. Is there any size parameters that you can share?","Jeff Immelt","Look, guys, we still like this industry. I would go back, Deane and \u2013 look, we never, as we built our portfolio in Oil & Gas, we never thought about it reflecting $120 for oil or anything else. Our investment is really made along the lines of \u2013 we felt like the industry was going to be growing in technical intensity, customer solutions, that over time the Oil & Gas business would look a lot like our Aviation business or our Power business or things like that, and that\u2019s what led to the investments.","So we\u2019re a long-term player in Oil & Gas. We like the industry. We\u2019re committed to the industry. I think as we look at opportunities and where we are today, anything would have to hurdle above buying back our own shares. And so we\u2019ll be opportunistic, we\u2019ll be disciplined, and we have an alternative that we think is still quite attractive for us of buying back our own shares.","Deane Dray","Good, that\u2019s helpful. And just last question from me is one of the moving parts in the 2015 framework that is outside of your control is the timing, the assumption of the close of Appliances. That\u2019s really \u2013 that\u2019s in the hands of Electrolux; it\u2019s in the hands of the regulators. So could you just remind us what that P&L impact would be if that close gets pushed into 2016?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, Deane. So you\u2019ll recall we talked about something that looked like a $0.06 a share gain associated with Appliances. So if it got pushed out of the year, we\u2019d probably rethink a little bit about what we\u2019re doing on restructuring in the fourth quarter; we would consolidate a full quarter of Appliance earnings, which would be a bit of an offset. And more likely than not, that would probably entail a breakup fee.","So we still think we\u2019re well within the range of $1.13 to $1.20. But probably that would push us to the bottom end of that range versus being at the top. So we\u2019ve thought through that, and we\u2019ve also thought through it in terms of cash. I think we\u2019re fine. We\u2019re closing on Alstom and doing everything we need to do around cash flow even without closing Appliances.","Jeff Immelt","I think, Deane, the base assumption is still that we close this deal. I think Jeff\u2019s given you \u2013 I think it\u2019s always good to scenario-plan; but the base assumption still is that we finish. I don\u2019t see any reason why we shouldn\u2019t. But to your point, it\u2019s not completely under our control.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker","Hey, so since you started to talk about 2016 a little bit, I\u2019m going to just push the envelope here. The way I\u2019m looking at it anyways, if you hit that midpoint around $1.15 to $1.20 you talk about on 2015 EPS, it looks like $1.17, you\u2019re telling us you\u2019ve got $0.10 from Synchrony; you\u2019ve got something like based on the GECC buyback, $0.06 to $0.08; you\u2019ve got Alstom now, you\u2019re talking about I think $0.06 minimum.","So, without assuming any other growth from your Industrial business, that\u2019s up like more than $0.20 there. Then GECC, I\u2019m not sure what you guys are thinking for that, but we\u2019re certainly starting to get into that well north comfortable of $1.50, especially if you could hold Oil & Gas flat. Is that \u2013 am I thinking about this in the right way?","Jeff Immelt","Well, what I would say, certainly the pieces you\u2019re putting together, Steve, kind of hang together, right? I would say Oil & Gas is going to be down next year; that\u2019s got to be the working assumption. I think the focus Jeff and I are going to have is to try to offset that with lower Corporate as we think about next year; so we want to run Corporate lower. And then I would say, look, we\u2019re going to give you guys a full estimate on all the other pieces of our Industrial outlook in December. But, look, we\u2019ve got strong services, strong services growth, big backlogs. And we\u2019re going to win some nice orders in the fourth quarter and I just \u2013 I feel like we\u2019re going to look pretty good next year in the world we see today. So, Jeff, do you want to add\u2026","Jeff Bornstein","No, I just \u2013 I think you got it exactly right. I don\u2019t think you can start with the premise of oil and gas flat. Having said that, Alstom is going to contribute, EPS accretion is going to contribute, no question about it, lower corporate. We expect to be better operationally in the segments, and we expect EPS is going to grow double-digits next year for sure.","Operator","The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks, good morning. Just\u2026","Jeff Bornstein","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Hi, Jeff. I just wanted to dig into 4Q and obviously the orders primarily a function of the tough prior comp. The back \u2013 the equivalent backlog is pretty flat with where it was in 3Q. So I am wondering if you could just maybe put a finer point on organic into 4Q. You\u2019re running at 4% year-to-date. I\u2019m wondering how you view organic into 4Q?","Jeff Bornstein","Well, we\u2019ve got quite a range here on our expectation for fourth quarter orders. But generally speaking, we expect them the comp much better than what you saw in the third quarter, both headline and organically. So we\u2019ve got some big orders in transportation, some big orders in power and water, we\u2019re looking to deliver in the fourth quarter. We expect aviation to be slightly better. So we think sequentially the fourth quarter is going to look much better than the third quarter for sure.","Nigel Coe","Wait, are we talking revenue orders, Nigel?","Jeff Bornstein","Orders, Nigel. Because I think revenue in Q4 is going to look fairly comparable to what it\u2019s been year-to-date, right.","Nigel Coe","Yes.","Jeff Bornstein","Yes.","Jeff Bornstein ","So we\u2019ve been running, I think we\u2019re at 4% organic revenue growth year-to-date. My hunch is that\u2019s going to be pretty consistent with Q4.","Operator","The next question comes from Shannon OCallaghan with UBS.","Shannon OCallaghan","Good morning guys.","Jeff Bornstein","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon OCallaghan","Hi, so nice to see the higher GE Capital dividend for 2015. With the Wells deal and Synchrony now done, real estate ranged, is 14% Tier 1 still the right base to be using, given that all those things that are now sort of clearly on their way out? And how are the international consumer sales, are there any things that would make you still be using 14%?","Keith Sherin","Shannon, this is Keith. I\u2019d say that\u2019s sort of the framework that we\u2019ve agreed to with the regulatory oversight that we have, so I don\u2019t see us changing that until we ultimately aren\u2019t under that same framework. Right now, as you know, we ended the third quarter at 13.7%. I think with the asset sales in the fourth quarter will go up about 14%. We expect to dividend $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, based on those asset sales and our governance process. And then we\u2019re on track for what we said we do in 2016. But I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t see that threshold really changing until you have a different regulatory environment.","That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important for us to continue to shrink. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important for us to target applying to not be a SIFI in the first quarter. I think that\u2019s going to take some time. And then when we get done it with that, we still have our international regulators. So I think you should assume that that\u2019s a threshold for some period of time for us, and we need to continue to exit the businesses in a rapid pace and build the capital, so that we can distribute it back to the parent.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Jeff Bornstein","Hey, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thanks, just a quick question on healthcare. The profits ex-currency were up in Q2. They\u2019re down mid single-digit Q3. And you talk about R&D being hiked in the slide; so maybe just given update on the cost progress in Healthcare, particularly given the volume outlook in emerging markets and the fact that pricing is still very challenging. I think you\u2019d talked before about Healthcare profits growing this year. I think they\u2019ll clearly be down; but maybe give us some look in terms of the cost base entering next year.","Jeff Immelt","So I would say, first, just to echo part of your question, I think the developed world is better, so U.S. and Europe are getting better. The emerging markets are mixed for Healthcare, but more headwind than tailwind. What Jeff said in terms of really trying to convert our Healthcare IT business, and get it on Predix, and spend a little bit of incremental R&D on that side of the business, I think it\u2019s something that we wanted to do this year to give us some momentum going into next year.","And then I think the business has a whole series of variable-cost productivity and product cost-out programs that are going this year that have yet to bear fruit that I would expect to roll into next year. So I think \u2013 look I think the markets are challenging. We did some one-time investment this year, and it\u2019s our expectation that the team can execute better going into \u2013 the rest of 2015 and going into 2016.","Jeff Bornstein","All right, I\u2019d just \u2013 I\u2019ll give you a little color on the third quarter, since you asked it. Definitely price was a challenge in the quarter. We\u2019re down 1.9 points of price. So we had the negative $100 million of value gap. That was definitely a challenge. But the business has actually got pretty good productivity. We were well over $100 million in total cost productivity in the quarter.","And really what swung here was volume was a bit lighter than we thought it was going to be, largely emerging markets. And we had about $50 million incremental spend on R&D year-over-year to accelerate the programs we talked about, and that\u2019s where the challenge came through.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Hey, so clearly there was an announcement recently that you guys have a new holder to your top 10 list. I was just wondering how those conversations are going and whether there are any new incremental portfolio or cost opportunities that have come from it.","Jeff Immelt","Look, I would say, Joe, I think the white paper kind of lays out their thesis. And I think that\u2019s \u2013 we don\u2019t agree with everything, but it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve done and what we\u2019re doing. And so I don\u2019t think there would be much to add to that. I don\u2019t know, Jeff, what would you?","Jeff Bornstein","We are laser focused on margins and cost productivity, as we should be, reducing corporate costs. That all lines up with Trian\u2019s white paper. And we\u2019re about executing on orders and revenues so we can have that leverage fall through to earnings.","Jeff Immelt","Industrial balance sheet pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past and things like that, Joe.","Jeff Bornstein","And that will be paced \u2013 the discussion around leverage will be paced by how quickly we get through the de-designation process in GE Capital.","Operator","The next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Glynn","Hey, just further to Julian\u2019s questions on Healthcare, we\u2019ve seen emerging markets become a much higher volume business over the past few years, and developing markets had a lot of regulatory dust settling here. So just wondering if there are any permanent evolutions or resets in the served markets there, where we, kind of, rethink what levels Healthcare performs at over the next five years?","Jeff Bornstein","I don\u2019t think so. Obviously, China has been a very strong growth market for Healthcare for quite a period of time. You\u2019ve got to remember, 74% of orders and roughly revenues come from developed markets still. Even with all the emerging market growth we\u2019ve had in Healthcare, we\u2019re still about almost three-quarters from the U.S., Europe, Japan. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any change in the geographic footprint of where we think Healthcare is going or where the growth is going to come from. We\u2019ve got some particular markets that are challenging based on commodities, FX, or politics; think about Russia, the Middle East. Places like Iraq are very, very tough to comp year-over-year.","We actually feel a little bit better that China is stabilizing a little bit for Healthcare. The performance this quarter sequentially was better, and we think the tendering process is ultimately going to pick back up. When you think about China, the underlying fundamentals haven\u2019t changed. There is still 1.5 billion people. They\u2019re still building hospitals. The private market in China has grown 15% to 20% a quarter. It\u2019s the slowdown in the public tender as part of the campaign the government\u2019s been running there has put some slowness into what we\u2019ve seen in terms of order. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a change in footprint here on a go-forward basis, and we\u2019re still three quarters developed market driven.","Operator","The next question is from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hi, Rob.","Robert McCarthy","Hi, how are you doing?","Jeff Immelt","Good.","Robert McCarthy","I wanted to ask a question just about if we\u2019re heading into an industrial recession here \u2013 and you may disagree with that premise. Could you just talk a little bit about the prospect for combating deflation? Because if we\u2019re in a deflationary environment and we have a kind of a multiyear down-cycle where we\u2019re kind of looking for a bottom in terms of volumes and cutting price, I mean isn\u2019t the portfolio actually set up for that, just given the installed base of equipment and the service streams you have? Maybe you could just comment on that a little bit.","Jeff Immelt","So, Rob, again, I come back and just \u2013 U.S. a little bit better everyday. Europe stable to up; and then emerging markets volatile. Right? So I think that\u2019s \u2013 revenue passenger miles on aviation still positive. Demand, I would say if you are in the gas and wind business and power, more positive than negative, right? Oil and gas tough for sure. U.S. market in healthcare growing better, slower in emerging markets. In other words, the first thing I would say is, the picture is a slow growth and volatility picture. And I think there is still pockets of growth out there pretty universally.","And then I would say, look, the fact that we\u2019re big installed base, recurring revenue model, margin efficient, capital efficient, I think that\u2019s a positive for GE in this cycle. And then our value gap continues to run positive, right. So the ability of us to kind of source well on the marketplace is a tailwind, not a headwind.","Jeff Bornstein","I would just add, the fact we have a $270 billion backlog is very, very important in that kind of environment. $200 billion of that in the service space, right? So from a price perspective, that\u2019s quite important. We are all about product and service costs. So to maintain our profitability and grow it and, to be competitive, we have got to drive it to the same dollars of deflation that you are suggesting. So we are laser focused on this. The product and service cost competitively as just as important as the actual technology we\u2019re selling. So we are on top of this.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Jeff. ","Jeffrey Sprague","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Hey, just a couple cash and liquidity related questions. First, on the Capital side, if stuff is going a little bit richer than you thought, why not upside to the $35 billion of Capital return over the program? And then just on the Industrial side, if you kind of work through the pieces, you\u2019re kind of guiding 80% free cash flow conversion on Industrial. If we start with CFOA and take out GE Capital dividend and account for CapEx it\u2019s kind of an 80% conversion ratio. Is there anything going on this year that kind of is conspiring negatively to that number? Should we see higher conversion into next year? Maybe you could just kind a walk us through those dynamics.","Keith Sherin","Hey, Jeff. This is Keith. I\u2019ll just cover a little bit on the $35 billion. As we said, we do have a little bit of price that we\u2019re getting, price to tangible book, so ahead of what our plan was by a bit. And that\u2019s been offset by the fact that we\u2019re selling faster. We tried to say that on the page by \u2013 a lot of those transactions were estimated to be later in 2016 and into 2017, and by selling them early, we\u2019re forgoing that future income. ","On the other hand, in total, we\u2019re expecting about 1.1 times price to tangible book. We\u2019re a little ahead. You can see the U.S. assets that we\u2019ve sold mostly so far, are selling at 1.4 times price to tangible book. A little ahead of what we thought 1.3. And then the rest of the assets, we think if we\u2019ve got them priced right overall will be just a little ahead of 1.1 times for the total $200 billion of sales. So I think we\u2019re right on the $35 billion and we feel pretty good about it. ","Keith Sherin","Yes. Excuse me. On CFOA for the year, we think our cash conversion ratio on CFOA and free cash flow for the year is going to be closer to 84%, 85%, not 80%. So we actually think we\u2019re going to have a decent performance on CFOA. We talked to you about a goal to get to 95% over the next two to three years, we are laser focused on that. I didn\u2019t suggest at any point in time we were going to do that in 2015. ","Matt Cribbins","Great. Jeff, a couple quick announcements before you wrap up. The replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We\u2019re going to hold our fourth quarter earnings webcast on Friday, January 22, and we\u2019re going to hold our annual Outlook Meeting on Wednesday, December 16. Jeff?","Jeff Immelt","So Matt, again I think a great execution quarter for the team. I just want to particularly congratulate all our GE Capital folks for great execution on the plan we laid out on April 10. And really we\u2019re thrilled about Synchrony, the value, the company. We think this is going to be \u2013 the Synchrony transaction, is going to be a great transaction for GE investors and for Synchrony investors. So thanks, Matt. Everybody have a good day.","Operator","This concludes our conference call. Thank you for your participation today.

And welcome to the General Electric Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in listen only mode. My name is Diana and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Trevor Schauenberg","Thank you, Diana. Good morning, and welcome everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s fourth quarter and total year 2012 earnings webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning and the presentation slides are available via the webcast. The slides are available on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast we have our Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO Keith Sherin. So to get started, we\u2019ll turn over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Tevor thanks. Good morning, everybody. Look, the GE team had a very strong quarter. We saw real strength in the emerging markets and the developed region stabilized, orders grew by 7%, excluding foreign exchange and Wind, and organic growth was 4% in the quarter and 8% for the year.","Earnings were strong with operating EPS up 13%. Industrial earnings were up 12% with all segments growing for the second straight quarter. Capital had another good quarter and for the year Industrial earnings were up 10% and Capital up 12%.","We delivered on our margin commitments which grew by 120 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points for the year. Industrial CFOA was also very strong in the quarter and for the year CFOA grew by 48% to $17.8 billion.","We return substantial cash to investors in 2012 through dividends and buyback, and in the fourth quarter we announced the 12% increase in our dividend and expansion of our buyback program.","Finally, December we announced the strategic acquisition of our Aviation business called Avio. So this was a very successful quarter for GE strengthened as the quarter continue and builds momentum for the future.","Orders grew by 2% in the quarter. This is up 7% excluding again the impact of foreign exchange and Wind. We had a solid order growth in five of six businesses, order pricing grew by 0.5% in the quarter, equipment book-to-bill ratio was 1.2 and we entered the year with a record high backlog of $210 billion.","Many of our businesses had great quarters, for instance, Healthcare homeowners grew by 7%, MR was up 12%, CT up 23% and ultrasound up 11%, and importantly, growth market order expanded by 12%.","Our growth initiatives continue to deliver. Our growth regions expanded by 9% in the quarter and 11% for the year. Six of nine regions grew by double digits including Russia, Australia, Latin America, China, Africa and Asian. For the year, China grew by 19%. Services had another good quarter in revenue backlog and margins. Power Gen services had a very strong quarter. Service backlog grew to a record of $157 billion.","We continue to launch new product and service offerings. We\u2019re wining with our Aviation product lineup, which is giving us high share of Commercial Engine. Oil and Gas had record orders and backlog.","Our subsea orders almost double versus last year and Distributed Power grew by 19% for the year. In November, we announced nine new service offerings for the Industrial Internet with 20 in the pipeline. So we continue to deliver in volatile markets.","GE had a great margin performance in the quarter, margins grew by 120 basis points in the quarter and 30 basis points for the year, every business grew margins in the quarter and our performance really was driven by value gap expansion of $330 million, Service margins which grew by 190 basis points and simplification. For the year SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down 100 basis points. We achieve these results in spite of the fact that foreign exchange created a headwind for the year.","We entered 2013 with substantial momentum. We expect to have 70 basis points of improvement in 2013. This is based on very positive value gap, structural cost and service margins which are really in the run rate and mix in 2013 should not be a drag, so really a good job by the GE team.","GE had a very strong performance on cash as well for the year. We had $17.8 billion up 48%. Industrial CFOA in the quarter was $6.2 billion up 12%. We had good performance on working capital even while we continue to invest in growth. We end the year with a cash balance of $15.5 billion dollars and consolidated cash of $77 billion.","Our strong Industrial CFOA performance plus capital dividend is supporting our plan for balance capital allocation. So we returned $12.4 billion to investors through dividend and buyback, and we expect this to continue in the future.","We announced the acquisition of Avio in December $4.3 billion. As you know we have significant backlog of engines and shop visits. We\u2019ve invested in capability, materials and capacity to improve our new engine margins. Recently you\u2019ve seen several partnership announcements from GE Aviation in our supply chain.","And Avio we are acquiring an existing position of engine development. They bring complementary technologies to GE. We think there is an opportunity to expand this technology beyond Aviation, and their substantial synergies about $200 million or more and relatively low execution risk.","So 8.3 times EBITDA we believe this will generate a good return for our investors and we expect to close in the second half of \u201813 after regulatory approvals.","So now I\u2019m going to turn back over to Keith to talk about company operations.","Keith Sherin","Thank you, Jeff. I\u2019m going to start with fourth quarter summary. So the income statement we had operations revenues of $39.3 billion. That\u2019s reported up 4%, ex-FX revenues were up 5%. Industrial sales of $27.3 billion are up 2%, up 3% ex-FX again. Capital revenues of $11.8 billion were up 2% and operating earnings of $4.7 billion were up 13%.","Operating earnings per share of $0.44 were up 13%. If you look, (inaudible) continuing EPS this year includes the impact of a non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations which I am going to cover on the next page.","As Jeff said, year-to-date cash of $17.8 billion was up 48%, including the dividends from GE capital with great year on cash. For taxes, the GE rate, 21% for the quarter, that\u2019s up about 6 points from last year mostly due to higher pre-tax income. In the fourth quarter GE rate is consistent with our rate through the third quarter and the low 23 we forecast all through the year. So right now we forecast a similar GE tax rate for 2013. The 6% GE Capital rate\u2019s consistent with the mid single-digit rate we forecasted in the third quarter. As we mentioned in December, our plan for next year for GE Capital includes less tax benefits. So right now I forecast a rate of approximately 10% for 2013 for GECC.","On the right side you can see the segment results. Total industrial segment profits up 12%, it\u2019s great to have 07 at the industrial segments delivering positive earnings growth and these results also contributed to industrial segment profit of $15.5 billion, up 10% for the total year.","GE Capital also had a strong quarter. Earnings were up 9%. If you include the impact of the preferred dividends, GE Capital represented 36% of total company earnings in the fourth quarter. Overall, a strong segment growth quarter, and I am going to cover each of the segments in more detail in a minute. Before I get to the businesses though, I will start with the other items in the quarter \u2013 fourth quarter.","First, on the one-time benefits we had $0.01 of after-tax gains from two non-core dispositions that occurred in the fourth quarter in the segments. We sold the Thomas Medical business in Healthcare. That business sells disposable medical devices for cardiology, and we realized a $24 million after-tax gain; and in aviation, we sold Smiths business in California in Duarte which makes thrust reverser actuation equipment, and we realized a $67 million after-tax gain, so in total $0.01 on the benefits.","We also had $0.02 of after-tax restructuring and other charges in the quarter. These charges related principally to continued cost structure improvements at GE Capital, at Healthcare, Power & Water, and Energy Management as well as some business development costs.","On the bottom of the page, we had $305 million of charges in discontinued operations. We booked $286 million of additional reserves on a gray zone this quarter. While we watched the claims decline 28% in the third quarter, the claims in the fourth quarter were above our model expectations. So we revised our assumptions this quarter. Right now we\u2019re reflecting a further slowing in the overall claims reduction rate than we had previously modeled and that brought our year end reserve to $700 million. So we will continue to update you as events and facts change on the gray zone rate.","Right now, I\u2019ll switch to the business results. First, I will start with Power & Water. As you know, this is the first quarter we\u2019re reporting the three separate businesses. So Power & Water, the business continued to be impacted by wind, however the overall execution delivered positive operating results. Orders of 7.2 billion were down 16%, down 6% ex-wind. The equipment orders of $3.5 billion were down 26% driven by thermal and renewables.","The thermal orders of $974 million were down 49% as we had orders for 26 gas turbines versus 50 last year and we also had orders for two steam turbines versus 20 last year. In addition there were $500 million of thermal order slips that went out of the fourth quarter into 2013.","For the total year we had orders for 108 gas turbines versus 134 in 2011 and the total year thermal orders in dollars were down about 7%. Total thermal order pricing was up 1% in the fourth quarter and up 0.5% for the total year. Our renewables; fourth quarter renewable orders of $987 million were down 50%. We had orders for 412 wind turbines versus 1023 last year. Renewable order pricing was positive 0.4% and service orders of $3.6 billion were down 3%.","Power Gen services was up 7% and you will see that\u2019s important in terms of profit, but that was offset by nuclear which was down 15% in line with lower activity in Japan. For revenues of $7.7 billion, they were up 2%, that's driven by services. Equipment revenues of $3.9 billion were down 2% driven by thermal down 14%, partially offset by wind of 10%. We shipped 32 gas turbines versus 33 last year, and we shipped 722 wind turbines versus 688 last year. Service revenues of $3.7 billion were up 5% driven by PowerGen services, which was up 8%. In PowerGen services, our profit was up double-digit in the quarter.","Total segment profit of $1.7 billion was up 5% as the benefits of the higher services and lower product costs more than offset lower prices. And in the quarter, margins expanded by 80 basis points.","On the right side, oil and gas had another strong quarter closed out a great year. Orders of $5.6 billion were up 18%. Equipment orders of $3.1 billion were up 31% driven by the strong subsea systems and drilling and surface orders.","Year-to-date, equipment orders were up 21%. Service orders of $2.4 billion were up 4% on again strong subsea systems orders. Total orders pricing was up 1.3%. We finished the year with a backlog of over $14.8 billion, up $2.6 billion from last year and our seventh consecutive quarter of positive orders pricing.","Revenue of $4.5 billion was up 11% driven by equipment. Equipment revenues of $2.4 billion were up 27% driven by subsea systems, up 34%. Measurement and controls were up 63%. Turbomachinery was up 16%. And service revenue of $2.1 billion was down 2%.","Segment profit of $649 million was up 14%. It was driven by the strong volume and positive pricing and our acquisitions continue to perform. For the year, they\u2019re up significantly and above pro forma. So overall, another strong growth quarter for oil and gas.","Next is aviation. The aviation team had another solid quarter in fourth quarter. Orders of $7.4 billion were up 8%. The commercial engine orders of $3.6 billion were up 9% driven by CFM LEAP and GEnx. Military engine orders of $632 million were up 57% driven by U.S. orders for F1-14 and T700 as well as foreign military orders for F1-10 engines.","We ended the quarter with a backlog of $22.9 billion, up 6% versus the third quarter. Service orders in the quarter of $2.7 billion were up 1%. Commercial services were flat. The fourth quarter spares order rate was $22.3 million, which was flat with last year. As you know, we did see spares order stabilize in the fourth quarter and as you know, spares were down double digit all year long.","So flat was an improvement and the total year rate was $22 million, down 11% from 2011. Total orders pricing was up 2.3% for the business. Revenue in the quarter, $5.5 billion, was up 11%. That's driven by equipment, which was up 19%, Services were up 3%.","We shipped 589 commercial engines in the fourth quarter, which was up 71 engines from last year and we shipped 48 GEnx units in the fourth quarter. Commercial service revenues of $1.8 billion were flat in the quarter and segment profit of $1,039 million was up 22%. It\u2019s up 8% ex the deal that I covered on the other items page.","So ex the deal, segment profit growth was driven by positive price, lower base costs, partially offset by negative engine mix.","On the right side, healthcare, we had a good orders quarter. Fourth quarter for healthcare, orders of $5.4 billion were up 4%. Equipment orders of $3.4 billion were up 7%. Developed markets were flat but there was a big shift here. The U.S. was up 8%. Europe was down 8%.","Emerging markets were up 24%, continued strength in the business. The Middle East was up over 100%. Russia was up 29%, China up 22%, Latin America up 21%, partially offset by India down 12%.","By modality, CT was up 23%, MR was up 12%, ultrasound was up 11%, molecular imaging was down 8%, Life Sciences was up 5%, and MDx was down 3%.","Service orders in the quarter of $2.1 billion were down 1% and total orders price was down 1.8% for the business. Revenue of $5.2 billion was flat driven by the growth markets, up 13% offset by the developed markets down 3%. And segment profit of $1,021 million was up 7% as the benefits of cost productivity and other income more than offset the negative price and foreign exchange.","Organic segment profit growth for the business, if you look in the fourth quarter, it was up 1% and for the year it was up 3%.","Next is transportation. Transportation team delivered another solid quarter despite a slowing topline. Orders of $1.3 billion were up 7%. Equipment orders of $600 million were up 20% driven by the strong international locomotive orders.","We had orders for 100 locomotives versus 74 last year. We had strong mining orders, and mining is down a little bit actually, $151 million was down 7%, and service orders of $720 million were down 3% as fewer signaling orders offset strong locomotive service orders, which were up 14%.","Revenues were down 7% on as expected lower locomotive shipments. We had a 117 locomotives this year versus 258 last year, just the way we planned the year and this was partially offset by the stronger service which was up 26% and mining revenues, which were up 57%","Profit was up 12% on higher service and positive value gap. This is the first quarter we\u2019re presenting energy management separately. The businesses here are Converteam, which is now power conversion, digital energy, industrial solutions, and intelligent platforms.","Orders of $2.2 billion were up 12% driven by the strong growth in power conversion, oil and gas marine orders. Revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% as lower intelligent platform sales offset the growth in power conversion which was up 6%. Segment profit of $64 million was up 36% with 90 basis points of margin expansion driven by a positive value gap more than offsetting lower volume.","And on the bottom, Home & Business Solutions had a very positive quarter. With intelligent platforms now reported in energy management, this segment is just appliances and lighting going forward. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 2% driven by appliances. We did see some strength in the contract channel from new housing starts and segment profit of $115 million was more than double last year\u2019s fourth quarter driven by higher pricing and lower product costs.","And to wrap up with GE Capital, Mike Neal and the capital team delivered another solid quarter. Revenues of $11.8 billion were up 2%. Higher core income, strong retail revenues, real estate sales more than offset the impact of lower assets. We ended the year with $419 billion of ending net investment, that\u2019s down $26 billion from 2011 driven by the shrinkage of non-core platforms and over $20 billion lower than our $440 billion goal that we set back in 2009.","GE Capital earned $1.8 billion in net income which was up 9%, that\u2019s driven by great results in real estate, growth in consumer, and that more than offset the $200 million lower income from lower assets.","On the right side, asset quality metrics showed continued improvement across the board driven largely by improved portfolio performance. Our net interest margin was 4.9%, up 49 basis points and we had strong volume of 54 billion in the quarter, up 11% from last year. Commercial volume was up 18% and consumer volume was up 8%, and new business volume averaged 3% returns.","One other point that\u2019s not on the page in the supplemental deck that we posted this morning you\u2019re going to see reserves at GE Capital decline by $400 million versus the prior quarter. This decline is driven by a modification to our write-off policy in line with regulatory guidance, where we now write off loans against specific reserves that we are accounting for more than 12 months. So, the change had primarily impacted real state, and CLL, and it has no impact on our income statement and the net impact on the balance sheet is zero but we had higher write-offs and lower reserves at the end of the quarter because of that about $400 million.","So if I go to highlights by business here, first, I will start with CLL. Net income of $544 million was down 30% driven by lower assets and prior year dispositions and also the non-repeat of last year\u2019s IRS settlement. In the Americas, net income of $455 million was down 20%, that\u2019s driven by the non-repeat of the tax item in the fourth quarter as well as lower assets. We did see strong volume growth in the Americas. In the fourth quarter volume was up 31% at 2.4% returns and in Europe, European CLL earned 83 million and was flat with last year.","Our consumer business had another positive earnings quarter. We ended the year with assets of $139 billion, flat with last year. Net income of $755 million was up 22%, that\u2019s driven by growth across-the-board in U.S. retail, in Europe, and in Asia. U.S. retail finance earned $477 million, which was up 3%, that\u2019s driven by higher assets and better margins, partially offset by higher credit costs as we continued our reserve segmentation that we talked about in the fourth quarter. U.S. retail finance volume was up 9% over last year, and core Europe earned $154 million in the quarter.","For real estate, commercial real estate had another quarter with significant improvements over last year. Assets of $46 billion were down $15 billion, that\u2019s down 24% from last year, it\u2019s down $9 billion or 16% from the end of Q3. So we do a good job of reducing our exposure to real estate. The business earned$309 million in net income, which was $460 million better than last year, that\u2019s driven by lower losses and impairments, higher tax benefits, and higher gains.","During the quarter, we sold 282 properties for $2.6 billion realizing $136 million in after-tax gains, and we also closed on the sale of the business properties book to EverBank resulting in $82 million of gains and $5.4 billion less real estate. Our unrealized loss on the equity portfolio was down to $1.1 billion at the end of the year and the outlook is that real estate is going to continue to deliver improved performance in 2013.","Next is GECAS, they had a solid fourth quarter. Net income of $343 million was up 9%, that\u2019s driven by higher gains and lower losses on impairments. Asset quality remains strong. We ended the year with two aircraft on the ground. And finally, energy financial services also had a solid quarter with earnings of $107 million, down 3%. So overall a great year, $6.4 billion of dividends paid back to the parent.","With that, let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Keith thanks. Just to wrap up on 2012 investor commitments, one last time on 20\u201912, we really hit all the major goals that we set out with you a year ago. We targeted strong Industrial growth and we hit 12% in the fourth quarter and 10% for the year. We said we would grow margins and we hit 120 basis points in the fourth quarter, 30 basis points for 2012, and we are on track for 70 basis points in \u201913.","We said we want to get cash out of GE Capital and we received $6.4 billion dividend to the parent. We said we would make GE Capital smaller and our ENI ended the year at $419 billion down 6%, even while we grew income by 12%. And we said capital allocation would be disciplined and balanced, and we returned more than $12 billion in dividends and buyback, and announced the $4.3 billion Avio acquisition. So, 2012 was a year where we really hit all of our financial commitments to investors.","Looking forward in 2013, there is no change to our 2013 operating framework that we talked about in December. If anything we start the year with a higher backlog and more cash. Our commitments are similar to \u201912. We plan to achieve double-digit Industrial earnings growth. We plan to receive a substantial dividend from GE Capital.","We plan to grow margins while driving solid organic growth and our fourth quarter orders support this growth. And we plan to return substantial cash to investors through dividend and buyback. So our fourth quarter performance gives us confidence for 2013. I think GE team has done a great job of execution.","And Trevor, now back to you for some questions.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great. Thanks Jeff and Keith. Diana, let\u2019s open the phone lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis, Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Scott.","Keith Sherin","Good morning.","Scott Davis - Barclays","It looks like most of the full year margin expansion came from value gap. Can you talk more specifically about 4Q to, 120 basis points is a pretty big number, if there is a way to, now think of that in terms of value gap versus maybe mix or cost?","Keith Sherin","Sure. I\u2019ll give you both actually, because I think it\u2019s helpful to look at the pieces. You said that in the fourth quarter value gap was big, it was 80 basis points. So the growth came from value gap. We had very strong pricing. We saw material deflation and you can see that the changes in order pricing are flowing through into revenue.","We had, Equipment service mix was a drag, as you know it's been a drag all year along. It was 50 basis points, the same as we had for the total year as we had higher revenues on Equipment growth than on Services. And also you know the Wind story, higher Wind revenues that the lower margins has been a drag all year along.","We offset that. There were two things. One, we did have the dispositions that was about 60 basis points in the quarter and we had strong productivity, which was 30 basis points in the quarter as we offset the impact of the negative mix, so overall 120 basis points.","And for year it\u2019s really a similar story, our value gap was 20 basis points, so that 30 basis points growth. We had a real drag on mix and other, that was in total 60 basis points, but we offset there were strong productivity, a lot of that is Simplification, our SG&A as a percent of revenue went down a 4-point.","We have done a good job with cost and we've got great programs in place that will help us as we go forward in the \u201813 as you know. And the gains in total for the total year were about 7 basis points on the impact for the margin. So, pretty good performance, strength really value gap and productivity driving margin improvement both in the quarter and for the total year.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay. Helpful. Keith thanks.","Keith Sherin","Yeah.","Scott Davis - Barclays","And kind of stepping back to it a little bit of bigger picture question, the Avio deal seems pretty interesting and for many reasons. But when you think about taking a step backwards and is this part of a bigger trend and an opportunity to start to buy in some of the supply partners that you have that, that, I mean, there is multiple positives that can come out of that, I guess in risk reduction and controlling intellectual property and things like that. I mean, is there other things out there that you can do that are similar to this type of transaction?","Keith Sherin","Scott, we did a couple other joint ventures that you probably saw last year that enhanced our position and controls and fuel nozzles, and additive manufacturing and things like that. We think Avio made a ton of sense just given the amount of GE content and things like that.","I would say, we don't have a bunch more on the drawing board. But what I would say is, we\u2019ve got an incredible backlog in Skyline of aircraft engines coming at us for the next 5 to 10 years, and we believe that actually being able to drive real productivity in the supply chain and innovation in the supply chain is -- will likely be one of the real margin enhancers as we look at the aviation business in the next three, four, five, 10 years.","So it is part of a bigger productivity play. I don't think there is necessarily things like Avio on the drawing board per se, but we continue to look at productive manufacturing of a well identified backlog as being a major source of margin benefit for our investors going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa, JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","The China growth of close to 20% remains a pretty strong. Could you maybe talk about what was above and below that average, and how you see that playing out in 2013? And you guys have skated through the weakness there pretty nicely.","Jeff Immelt","Steve I would stay we definitely saw China strengthen again at the end of the year. The big drivers of China continue to be healthcare and aviation, and we believe that the China momentum will likely continue into 2013. So I don\u2019t know, Keith, you want to\u2026?","Keith Sherin","Some V\u2019s I\u2019ll give you for the quarter, power and water had a big quarter. They were up over 30%. Healthcare had a big quarter, up 15%. For the year they were up over 20%. Aviation continues to be very important to us for the year up 18%. There were some orders that we had pushed out of the third quarter, still pushed out of the fourth quarter, so we expect some more orders in aviation in China in the first quarter. So those three are really the strength and we continue to see investments by the government in those industries, and we\u2019re benefiting from the move to gas in China a bit, the great emphasis on healthcare and certainly on transportation with the aviation position we have.","Jeff Immelt","There is a knock on, Steve, as well as China grows. You see more activity in Africa, Brazil, and places like that as well. So it\u2019s -- it has a knock-on effect that\u2019s also positive.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","How big is your China business going to be at year end now?","Keith Sherin","The revenue for the year was just a little under $6 billion in 2012.","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","And then one last question just on margins, I guess the value gap obviously is ramping here. That doesn\u2019t seem like that\u2019s lumpy, so you had your biggest quarter obviously in the fourth quarter which means you should probably start the year with a pretty decent value gap in the first half and then maybe if you would talk about how those other swing factors like mix, the other things you talked about in the bridge progress as you move through the first half of 2013, if there is anything lumpy that you need to call out that may impact the 70 basis points first half to second half type of thing?","Jeff Immelt","Steve, again as I look at margins, I think value gap is pretty well dialed in structural costs, what Keith talked about SG&A as a percentage of revenue, that should continue to get better. Those two aren\u2019t necessarily lumpy. Service margins aren\u2019t really lumpy. We continue to get good progress there. My view is Wind will be lumpy, right, as you think about how it plays through the balance of 2013. And the one that we don't really control so much is how mix goes through. So I\u2019d say a lot of the levers should continue with pretty good progress and the one that we will manage as year goes on is just the impact of -- there will be a $0.03 headwind in wind, and we don\u2019t see that necessarily changing and that\u2019s something to play through. We feel confident in the 70 basis points for the year.","Keith Sherin","We\u2019re not really giving quarterly margin guidance but as Jeff said for the year based on those factors we feel pretty confident we have internal plan that\u2019s above the 70. We don\u2019t have any gains that are in the plan to get to that 70 and we\u2019ve got some good momentum as we come out of the fourth quarter on the margin improvement.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Hi, just looking for a little more color around orders. Just first at a high level, you are calling the quarter flat at 11.8 but I see 12.5 last year in the quarter. What\u2019s going on there?","Keith Sherin","I think it\u2019s the energy recast and eliminations.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah. I\u2019m talking about service in particular actually.","Keith Sherin","Yeah. That\u2019s what we have. We have a recast from Summit services went into equipment I believe.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Keith Sherin","(Multiple Speakers) about the corporate. We gave that split, , it\u2019s a little bit of decoder ring. I don\u2019t have the details with me, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then just on the power-related stuff. So power and water in aggregate, price was down 20 bps but I think you said Keith just trying to keep up with your thermal was up 1. Is that thermal number just equipment or is that service and can you provide any color on service pricing in the business?","Keith Sherin","Yes. The number I gave was the total business. Thermal and PGS were up one in the quarter. If you look at -- I don\u2019t have a separate breakout for services for the fourth quarter. I have thermal in total.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Keith Sherin","But if you look, we\u2019ve -- all year long in thermal, it was positive in the first and second quarter, it was a little negative in the third quarter, it was positive in the total year, it was up half a point for thermal equipment and service.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And then just finally, flipping over to Aero, so the ADOR stabilized, do you have visibility you think at the after markets, kind of, found the bottom and inflecting or is it early to kind of determine that?","Keith Sherin","Yes. I think the way the team has talked to us about it and in the market, you continue to see pretty good revenue passenger-miles lumpy in 2012 but recovered a little bit at the end of the year, and for us to have flat ADORs, it\u2019s given that there was an awful lot of working capital management in the supply chain and some mix for us with the old CF-6s on freight was a positive sign.","Right now, the team is forecasting a little bit of improvement off of that fourth quarter rate in the first quarter, and we\u2019re going to have to see as we go through the quarter, it is too early in the quarter right now to know and a couple weeks in, but they are forecasting, it will be improving over the [fourth] (ph) quarter levels.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","And any concern about your GEnx productivity ramp with maybe things backing up with Boeing, if you\u2019ve get any thought on how things might play there as it relates to you?","Keith Sherin","Well, we\u2019re going to have to see. Right now, we haven\u2019t had any schedule changes from them. Actually, as you know, if there are few less engine shipments that\u2019s not a bad thing in terms of margins -- based on the margins on the initial GEnx shipments. We had a great year on GEnx, Jeff.","We came down the learning curve. Obviously, some of the pricing that you\u2019re seeing in aviation is coming through on GEnx. There was an improvement on margins per units in those shipments. So we don\u2019t anticipate it to be a big deal, but again we\u2019ve got to see Boeing kind of work their way through the problem.","Just a little number on our engines. On the 1B we\u2019ve had 35,000 flight hours with 99.97% dispatch reliability. And on the 2B, on the 747, we have 310,000 flight hours with 99.94% dispatch reliability. I mean, the engine is performing very well in the fleet, and customers love it.","So we have got to work through Boeing. And we\u2019re trying to help them with whatever they\u2019re working through, and we will, but so far for us, we\u2019re very pleased and our customers are very pleased with the GEnx.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thank you very much.","Keith Sherin","Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess, good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","A question, a broader question, given the resolution, partial resolution of the fiscal cliff, are you seeing any improvement in sentiment from your customers in the U.S.?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I mean, I think there is certain tangible things like the production tax credit, Andrew. So, that basically opens up a two-year window. So I would say on balance that\u2019s more positive, and we hear more positive comments coming out of the renewable energy sector.","Other than that, Andrew, I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re necessarily picking up whether or not that\u2019s been deliberating or not. The shortest cycle business in GE is our appliance business. We get appliance market data every week and the industry itself was about flat in December and the industry itself is about flat through the first couple of weeks of January. So is that helpful?","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And Just a question on GE Capital, do you think these ROIs are sustainable? Are you seeing more competition, we\u2019re entering the space and any more color by segment on ROIs and new business? Thank you.","Keith Sherin","It does vary. I think on some things like asset back lending, we\u2019ve seen some more competition. But in other places, we\u2019ve had less competitors. Overall, for CLL in order to do $14.5 billion in the Americas that are 2.4 in the quarter, that\u2019s pretty good volume and at a pretty good rate. So the team has been very disciplined on pricing and margin hurdles, and so far we have been able to get the volume we wanted at the return hurdles that we\u2019ve set.","And we expect to see that continuing in 2013. I think we saw a little bit of a bubble with the fourth quarter from some of the fiscal cliff activity as people did a lot of refinancing and tried to get gains on sales of their properties out in the quarter. But other than that we've been pretty disciplined on pricing and we expect it to continue to be reasonably good.","Jeff Immelt","All I would add is exactly what Keith said, some of this is our own discipline about where we\u2019re going to write business and we've been exceptionally disciplined. And I think the fact that volume was pretty good in the quarter, kind of lets just get the sense that we\u2019re in the market and our disciplines are appropriate.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And on asset quality we\u2019ve seen changes to consumer, we\u2019ve seen changes to CLL. Any more policy changes on the line?","Jeff Immelt","Well, those were two that we\u2019re working through. I think we\u2019re significantly through the consumer as far as the segmentation, there may be a little more in the first quarter. And on the write-off this was just -- there is regulatory guidance and we are complying with it. I am not aware of any other besides those two right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Sticking with GE Capital, a question on provisions, it looked like you absorbed at least a penny more than what we were looking for. But now that I look at the consumer delinquencies they are at the 18 year low. So I raise the question, I know this is completely formulaic and it\u2019s out of your discretion. But when might we start seeing some releases of reserves?","Jeff Immelt","Well, I don\u2019t anticipate that. I can tell you right now what we\u2019re basically, I think a simple rule of thumb to look at the consumers you\u2019re probably going to be looking at 12 month of reserves or provisions for losses in that book. While we have seen delinquencies come down and you're right, we have a tremendous asset quality there. It\u2019s the best we have seen as you said. We have increased the segmentation of the portfolio to be more granular on different loss types and that\u2019s added through provisions. You can see in the fourth quarter provisions dropped, some of that\u2019s volume and about $50 million to $60 million after-tax of that is additional segmentation of the reserve to get to the 12 month kind of proxy here for loss levels.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","And then can you comment on the MetLife bank integration, any changes to the business model there? And a related question is as you start increasing this alternative financing where -- alternative funding you\u2019re expected to issue less commercial paper and maybe that, the aggregate amount of commercial paper coming down might actually give you better spreads, better financing and maybe if you can comment on that as well.","Jeff Immelt","While we\u2019re thrilled with the MetLife close obviously we\u2019ve put it in the consumer bank. The objective here is to grow our deposits online and they give us a franchise and a capability to be able to do that. Our expectation is that we\u2019re not only going to do that in the consumer back but we\u2019re going to migrate that over to the commercial bank. And we\u2019re going to do more online deposits. As you said, our objective is to get the CP down in the 30 this year and continue to reduce CP, and we have been very successful with doing that. And we will continue -- I think you look at the trade-off of cost of deposits versus CP plus the bank lines, whenever backup cash we carry, I think this can be a good trade-off over time for us as we continue to diversify our funding.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","But is it too early to quantify what that spreads might be?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think you\u2019re not going to see that from a -- I mean CP is at 20 basis points steam, so you\u2019re not going to see a big number on that in 2013 for GE Capital. I think you will get a benefit from having less negative carry on the cash.","Now if you look at last year we took the cash of 70 plus billion dollars, we\u2019ll have a carry of around somewhere between 50 and 60 this year, that will probably be the biggest increase in sort of the financing margins.","Last year we had net maturities of $48 billion reduction in GE Capital. So it was a fantastic year for Capital on a balance sheet basis to kind of lower the amount of debt and improve their future debt maturity profile.","As you know, we\u2019re going to have $30 million to $35 million of long-term debt issuance a year now from a significantly higher level. So I think the Capital team has done a job. The biggest benefit you\u2019ll see will probably be on little less negative carry on the cash.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you.","Keith Sherin","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks. Good morning.","Keith Sherin","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Just first a follow-up question to an earlier one. We -- the question was around the order report today versus a year ago in the Q4 \u201911 press release. Can you talk about moving from Services to Equipment? If you look at the total, so I\u2019m just trying to understand that the total, I guess a year ago was $28.6 billion in the press release and this year it\u2019s $28.5, and you talked about just 2% increase? So when you look at the overall level, how much is it or how should I understand that, what\u2019s the gap?","Keith Sherin","To recast the orders are basically flat. There are up $56 million ex-Wind and FX, 5%, sorry, up -- they are up 5% ex-Wind and FX. So the recast we put a little bit more incorporate out of the energy infrastructure recast, but I think it\u2019s insignificant.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. All right. Fine. And then secondly, on the -- on Avio, just so I understand this, they produce the gear system obviously for the GTF on A320NEO and CSeries. I think they are pretty deeply involved in the development program and you are also calling out $200 million of synergies. Just how you are thinking about, how does that handle, how do you handle that going forward?","Jeff Immelt","Well, look, there are ton of different developmental programs inside the industry that people work on together. We do engines for Sikorsky. We buy it from Goodrich and Hamilton Sundstrand. So there is always, I\u2019d say a certain amount of developmental work that goes on inside the industry.","I think what was most appealing about Avio for us was really the amount content they had of GE engines. I think giving more control over our own supply chain, building capability, more reliability, leveraging, sourcing and manufacturing skills, things like that, that\u2019s really where we see Avio paying off for investors.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then maybe just last, I guess, Aviation is now up to about half of the backlog, and as Boeing and Airbus orders start to decelerate at this point. Is the thought that the backlog that Oil and Gas, and if you see that backlog maintaining are now starting to come down, they start running it off a little bit and getting it into the -- into revenues?","Keith Sherin","Well, you\u2019re going to, you are obviously right, you are going to see and we\u2019ve talked about it the last six months that with the Aviation backlogs of three to four to five years of Equipment, you are going to see lumpiness in those orders.","We feel great about the position and obviously, as the Airbus and Boeing, airframers increased their production run rates we are going to continue to see volume growth as you see in \u201911 to \u201912 and \u201912 to \u201913 we expect more commercial volume growth. But I would expect the orders to be lumpy.","The one offset to that as you\u2019re starting to see the Leap Max orders come in and so that will be an offset as you know there has been pretty good success in the marketplace from the 737 Max.","Jeff Immelt","But I think it\u2019s a great question, I don\u2019t think, I don\u2019t think either Keith or I ever thought we have $210 billion of backlog in GE. But I would say in the kind of volatile environment we leave in today, having that kind of visibility is actually quite a strong aspect and maybe Aviation feels off little bit.","But Oil and Gas, our orders in Oil and Gas are $0.5 billion or $1 billion in the crack. So it\u2019s easy to see how that order rate might continue with the rate it\u2019s on today and add to the backlog.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. And then Jeff, you mentioned that you still expect a $0.03 impact on Wind, the tax credit extension, obviously you got moved into through 2013, so that\u2019s not changing, thinking about the end of the year?","Jeff Immelt","Really, not yet, it just a, there is a, it really opens up a two-year window. So, I think, in aggregate over the next two years it\u2019s going to increase the number of Wind shipments we are going to have, but exactly which quarters and stuff like that is hard to predict.","Keith Sherin","As you know that the PTC extension is a little different this time, Steve. It\u2019s a -- the units will have to be in production by the end of the year and that\u2019s yet to be defined.","Jeff Immelt","Yeah.","Keith Sherin","But it\u2019s not the same as last year where they had to be actually operating.","Jeff Immelt","Yeah.","Keith Sherin","So, I think, it\u2019s all good for \u201913 and \u201914.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, Nomura","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Shannon. How are you?","Keith Sherin","Hi, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Good. So just in terms of the back to the orders, FX and ex-Wind being up 7%, I mean, at the December meeting I think you had said up a smidge and this sounds better than the smidge. What finished stronger I guess in December than you thought at the meeting?","Jeff Immelt","Look, there is a little bit of volatility going out there and we always try to give you guys a range of outcomes. One of our biggest industrial businesses went from having orders down 24% in October to having orders up 27% in December, and the total being up 7% for the quarter. So that's a big swing. That\u2019s a big swing. I would say Shannon, on balance we closed the quarter very strong. I would say all the businesses had good order books as we closed the quarter probably above even what our expectations were. I think that\u2019s good news. What that means or is it lumpy or things like, I think it\u2019s too soon to call victory but clearly the momentum built during the quarter.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","Then healthcare was probably the biggest swing?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, yeah.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","And power and water margins, so you\u2019re seeing, ex-wind they were up 300 bps, I mean the wind mix should be actually favorable from here. But that seems like an awfully high year over year run rate. So are there things that prevent us from continuing to track that kind of a rate?","Jeff Immelt","Well, the services business had a great quarter, so we really -- a lot of what we talked about in terms of services, I\u2019d say fourth quarter was fantastic and there\u2019s -- the mix for the business ought to be great for -- better for 2013. So we\u2019ll just see how the shipments work and all that kind of stuff. But\u2026","Keith Sherin","You look at 2012, I mean wind revenue was up close to 50% and the margins are down a couple points and they were already below-average for the company. So this had a huge 20 basis point impact on the total year, on the total company. And I think as you go into \u201813 you\u2019re going to have a couple billion dollars less of wind revenue. So we do expect that to be a positive. I don\u2019t know if you get to a full 20 basis points, we\u2019ll have to see how the PTC impacts that but will be a net positive versus what we saw in 2012, Shannon.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura","And just your M&A plan has been fairly modest but if you get NBC proceeds sort of sooner than the base plan, are there enough things out there that you see opportunities to redeploy very quickly into industrial deals or would you look for something else to do with the cash?","Jeff Immelt","Shannon, I just don\u2019t even want to speculate on how that plays out. I think we talked about balance and discipline, capital allocation, I think that's really the way I feel. We like having a good deal. We like the fact that we returned more than $12 billion cash to shareholders last year. We like having kind of a focused approach to acquisitions and if our world changes we\u2019ll come back and talk more about it but right now you shouldn\u2019t assume any change.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","My first question is really just on the value gap, you mentioned it\u2019s not really lumpy but if I look at your mid-December presentation, you had a double plus of value gap as the margin driver in \u201913, and today it\u2019s a single plus. I just wanted if that was because of something like healthcare pricing in the quarter being less than you thought in orders or what drove that?","Jeff Immelt","I think there is really no change in how I feel about value gap next year. It\u2019s good solid 330 this year, it will be better than that next year.","Keith Sherin","And I think if you look at order pricing overall you look at our total order price index, for the company it\u2019s been positive all year along 2012 and in total it was a positive 0.5 point, 50 basis points in the fourth quarter for the total year of deposits of 60 basis points. I don\u2019t think -- I think pricing is not going to change and our view continues to see strong\u2026","Jeff Immelt","Well, we think it\u2019s going to be above both.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And then secondly, in mid-December you talked about 5% services revenue growth in 2013, if I just look at the orders in services, that went down 2 year on year in Q2, down 4 year on year in Q3, flat in Q4. So are you still comfortable with that 5% services revenue growth through \u201813 just given that the orders haven\u2019t been that strong for nine months or so?","Keith Sherin","Actually, these are lumpy. The orders here are probably lumpier than others, particularly with the CSA. So I would say we have a huge backlog. And then our estimate of 5% organic revenue growth in services really assumes that aviation spares has a better 2013. So I think the combination of the fact that you get $157 billion backlog.","Sometimes what\u2019s goes in the orders of 10 or 15 years of commitment, right. So those goal based on sharp business and stuff like that, that we can model that makes us feel good about it. And some pieces really, we\u2019re expecting aviation spares to bounce back and those two things, I think really lead you to 5% service organic growth.","Jeff Immelt","If you look we had 4% revenue this year with aviation flat, just point is really one of the key differences what we expect in 2013 in aviation.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly on gas turbine shipments for \u201813, I mean, I\u2019m thinking they should be down maybe around 10% or so year-on-year. Does that sound about right?","Jeff Immelt","Basically, right now if you look we had 108 orders for the year. We\u2019re forecasting somewhere 100 gas turbines for 2013. And we\u2019ll see how the market plays out. So they\u2019re going to be down versus 2012. I think the factors to think about the thermal business itself on the equipment side is about 9% of out profit for the energy business.","So, really the dynamic for us is going to be how do services perform. We got a big growth forecast in for services. How does distributed energy perform? We\u2019ve got a nice orders performance in the quarter and we\u2019ve got a good outlook for 2013. And how do they do on controlling the cost? Those are going to be really the dynamics but the energy team is going to be working the way through.","Keith Sherin","And the megawatts will be bigger. Unit mix is higher on that.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Keith Sherin","Thanks, Julian.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn, Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Chris.","Keith Sherin","Hey, Chris.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","The backlog building nicely in orders better than expected as of December. I guess, sort of the lowering of the organic growth in December and that played out as you predicted, it was maybe a bit of an abrupt deferral with backlog conversion. Can you characterize how you see that unfolding from here? Does that tend to favor the first half and where does that focus your bias in the 2% to 6% organic range?","Keith Sherin","Well, look, I don\u2019t want to change to necessarily to 2% to 6%, Chris. What I would say is that the way we finish the year, the building on the backlog, I\u2019d say the strength of orders makes us feel good about next year and makes us feel good about the momentum we have going into next year. And then the only thing I\u2019d add to that vis-\u00e0-vis organic growth and how it splits. Again, we don\u2019t do some point estimates. It\u2019s just wind is lumpy and wind is going to continue to be lumpy in the future.","But if you take that out, the rest of the company, I\u2019d say you feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned going into next year. You had pretty good data -- really you had five of six businesses with what I would call robust order growth in the quarter from an industrial standpoint.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then just one on GE Capital, regarding the systematically important financial institution and the buffer needed for capital. Could you give any updates on the limitations on capital payout and with respect of your shrinking the balance sheet, is there any reason GE Capital will need to retain any earnings at some point in the future?","Jeff Immelt","Well, that\u2019s a good question. I think for us what we have to make sure is that we\u2019re meeting what we need to have to be -- from a regulatory perspective and from a rating agency perspective and from a management perspective safe and secure. We expect to be well capitalized in any scenario under Basel 1 or Basel 3.","We\u2019re going to meet the liquidity requirements that regulators have. And our objective is to be able to release capital as we continue to shrink the book as you say continue to generate profitability. And for us, we think we\u2019re in pretty good shape on that. You saw our success in 2012. We\u2019ve got number-one strong earnings. Number two, we had strong liquidity with over $60 billion of cash, less than $35 billion of long term debt we\u2019re going to issue this year, and we already completed nine of that. We have strong capital ratio as you saw we ended the year with tier 1 coming at 10.2 Basel I. We reduced our overall debt by over $45 billion last year.","We\u2019ve got strong portfolio quality. Delinquencies are down, non-earnings are down, and we continue to make strategic progress on running off the red assets and reinvesting in the green assets. So I think when we look at what\u2019s going on from a regulatory perspective we have not been designated as the systemically important institution yet.","We are in discussions, and the main issue that happens when you're designated is that you\u2019re going to be supervised by the Federal Reserve. We\u2019re already supervised by the Federal Reserve. So we'll see how that plays out but we believe that we have a pretty good framework against the regulatory guide posts and we\u2019re continuing to operate in a way that runs the company from a safe and secure perspective while also being able to be mindful of returning cash back to the parent and get that back to the investors. ","So I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good of this. I think Mike Neal and his team had a great year against those objectives and we\u2019ll have to see how that continues to play out.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Lots of moving parts between the segments and the results versus the outlook in orders and pricing. Can you just -- is there any way to do a little bit of a quick recap in terms of pricing particularly in Thermal but maybe you could parse that between gas, turbine, or just some of the other segments, Keith or Jeff, that are noteworthy? What\u2019s different about fourth-quarter pricing in backlog specifically on orders versus what you saw last quarter?","Keith Sherin","Well, if you look in the third quarter our parent order in total was down 1.9, and in the fourth quarter it\u2019s down two-tenths. I said thermal including services went from a negative 2.7 in the third quarter to a positive one in fourth quarter. Wind was down 36 in the third quarter, that\u2019s up four-tenths in the fourth quarter on fewer orders obviously. So those are some of the bigger pieces. Oil and gas third quarter 1.6, positive pricing fourth quarter 1.3 on high orders. Aviation continued positive pricing 2.3% positive in both third quarter and four quarter and healthcare continues to have the negative pricing 1.7 in the third, 1.8 in the fourth quarter. So overall we went from a tenth of a point positive price in the third quarter to 0.5%, 50 basis points positive in the fourth quarter. And it's a big area of focus, obviously as the whole team is working on improving margins and I think they\u2019ve got some pretty good traction here. I think the supply demand characteristics are what they are by business but overall for the portfolio to have 0.5 point of positive price a good place for us to be is the fourth quarter.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","I agree. Is the thermal price that you are getting, is that mix or are you actively trying to raise pricing? Or how -- what\u2019s going on there?","Keith Sherin","I think thermal pricing is lumpy, I would take it for the whole year, a half a percent up with equipment and services, that\u2019s kind of the way we look. We\u2019re expecting it to be flat to slightly positive for the year, Steve [Wolf] said it was going to be a little lumpy. And I think that's about where we are, obviously with the market where it is, I mean the supply demand characteristics are tougher in thermal. And on the other hand, you look at oil and gas, on the supply chain tightening, they are better in aviation. So I think it varies by business but overall we hit what Steve said a little better for the total year on thermal and 0.5 point up.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Jeff, with the eventual monetization of NBC and Capital as equity investments and red line assets that are going to come off, is your company between that and operating cash is going to throw off an awful lot of cash flow over the coming years. Would you be able to reaffirm your commitment sort of not to be doing big deals or anything beyond one to three? Avio was a little bit bigger but it's still in the zone or are you thinking about perhaps in a year or so perhaps stepping that up or how should we think about that at this juncture?","Jeff Immelt","Again, I was just -- I would make two comments. I\u2019d just say -- I don\u2019t really want to make any other pronouncements other than kind of disciplined and balanced capital allocation. I just really -- we\u2019ll go over the other bridge as we get there but let\u2019s start with that. And the second thing, I\u2019d reaffirm your first point, I think is one that's good for all investors to remember is, this company is going to have a tonne of cash over the next three years, right. Between -- whatever happens with NBC Universal between kind of as we look where we think GE Capital versus the guide post Keith talked about there is going to be a lot of cash. So lets leave it at that -- let's leave it with those two comments for right now John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","That\u2019s okay. And I\u2019m (inaudible) confuse with Steve, so no worries. Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","Okay.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe, Morgan Stanley. ","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning. ","Jeff Immelt","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","So speaking of the tonne of cash you just mentioned Jeff, when do you expect to have signoff for the capital allocation plan for GE Capital. Are you on the same schedule as the banks which I think they stress test resulted in March?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah. Nigel, we\u2019re not one of the major banks that goes through that systemic process every year. We do go through own process. I would say the best outlook would be to think of it as a mirror of 2012. And we will go through a lot of exact same steps with forecast and stress test and capital plans and all that. But last year, we had final decisions on that in the second quarter. And I would anticipate it would be the same in 2013 right now.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then searching back to December, it seems that December came in stronger than your, maybe your initial thoughts back in the annual meeting. Anything standout in terms of regions, the U.S. versus growth market versus Europe. Any one retail standouts in terms of that bump up in December?","Keith Sherin","We saw a little bit of strength in U.S., I\u2019d say in healthcare and appliances. And we saw a tonne of strength elsewhere, I\u2019d say natural and we saw more that in oil and gas and aviation, energy, really across the board so.","Again I think it\u2019s fits the broader, it fits the broader, I\u2019d say dialog and that we kind of think the growth markets will continue to grow in \u201813. And I want to think about the U.S., you\u2019ve got a slow and steady housing recovery that I think is very positive. And then there is still lot of physical uncertainty and how those blend through into U.S. GDP in 2013, we\u2019ll see.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then finally on getting them at life field, how does that deposit base impact your flexibility and optionality with regard to PLCC?","Keith Sherin","Well, we\u2019ll see. I think diversified funding base is good in that regard. Right now, we already in that business as you know a lot of it is financed by deposits, alternative funding and securitization. So now we\u2019ve got a kind of a different kind of deposits, more internet bank deposits. And at the end of the day, having more diversified funding, I think does give more flexibility for future activity. We don\u2019t have anything of that going on right now but I think just from having a more diversified funding based, you would have more optionality.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Brian Langenberg, Langenberg & Company.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, good morning Brian.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","Hey guys. ","Keith Sherin","Good morning","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","Good morning, Jeff. Just a couple of things, I\u2019ll do a bunch of follow-ups latter. Just review first briefly your total exposure of 787, obviously this is transitional or transitory?","And then secondly, in terms of the power cycle, I mean, I think we\u2019re pretty much looking for 2014 overall upturn. With power, are you thinking about potentially what the impact is in its cycle from, where I call to me and management either on companies making your buildings 20% more efficient or using grid to make -- of your utility, using your grid to make your existing generation capacity. Let\u2019s call it an ops management for utilities, if you will, just if you can address those two things?","Keith Sherin","I\u2019ll take a shot at the aviation first. Then you can talk about energy. Maybe -- if you think about 787 exposure, we obviously have inventory, our plan for 2013 we shipped 113 GEnx engines in \u201812. Our plan would be to ship 200 engines. So we\u2019ll see where Boeing goes with that. As I said, we haven't had any changes to the demand production schedule from Boeing on that yet and a bunch of those engines are on 747 as well.","So, for us, I think, if there is a push out of some engines in the first quarter, we may have a little more inventory and having less engines and RevRac maybe slight positive for margins. I mean, I don\u2019t really know the difference between what we are going to do this year versus what we did in the first quarter last year until we get finalize the Boeing.","But I don\u2019t see a material impact on this, on us at all and as I said, the engines are performing extremely well. So, we feel good. The customers love this plane. They\u2019ve had a ton of positive feedback and Boeing has to work through this issue and they will work through, we are confident of that.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","Okay.","Jeff Immelt","I would echo what Keith said, I think this is an immensely popular airplane, fuel efficient, passengers like it, airlines like it. So we are here to support Boeing wherever it goes on this 787, on the Dreamliner.","On Energy, I think Brian, we already factor in the fact that there is going to be an impact on demand side management, on demand for electricity. And you factor that into I think an overall health of the Gas portfolio vis-\u00e0-vis what happens with nuclear, what happens with the EPA.","And then, demand growth in places like Saudi Arabia, Algeria, places like that that still remains I think intact. So we try to factor that all in, but we also do factor in Energy Management, but we also benefit from that in our Energy Management business.","Keith Sherin","Yeah.","Brian Langenberg - Langenberg & Company","Okay. Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","Great.","Operator","We will take our final question come from the line of Daniel Holland, Morningstar.","Daniel Holland - Morningstar","Hi there. Good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Dan.","Keith Sherin","Hi, Dan.","Daniel Holland - Morningstar","Just curious what was pushing Industrial CFOA number down, I guess about 2% year-over-year, just considering the profit growth than the overall business this year?","Keith Sherin","Yeah. Really the biggest dynamic for us Daniel is in the Wind business. The Wind business has significant progress collections in prior periods and in total the Wind business was a drag on working capital in 2012 of about $1.5 billion.","So, the rest of the businesses with their earnings growth and management working capital we are able to overcome that. And then as you know, we had about $400 million of pension funding that we did that we didn\u2019t have any in 2011. So that $400 million was also part of the [GE]. But the biggest, biggest driver for us on working capital is a drag in the year was wind. And the businesses overcame that.","Daniel Holland - Morningstar","Got you. And one last one, just thinking about margins for next year and kind of simplification strategy you guys have identified. If you think about on a segment-by-segment basis, I mean, where the biggest opportunities are, that you guys see and kind of which ones might have already had the biggest benefit from simplification so far?","Keith Sherin","It\u2019s pretty broadly across the company, Daniel. We have every one of our teams working on lowering their structure. So having more consolidated high level P&Ls, we have everybody participating and putting their back offices into centers of excellence and more shared services across the company. And we have a common IT, initiative across the company to reduce our general ledger and enterprise resource planning systems that is pretty much across the portfolio. So everybody is participating, everybody has cost targets and it\u2019s pretty broadly.","Jeff Immelt","We\u2019ve got a lot of good restructuring projects that are year, year and a half or two year paybacks. So we\u2019re lined up and we think we can keep the structural cost, keep going down as a percentage of revenue. Our target is to really accelerate that.","Daniel Holland - Morningstar","Great. Thanks.","Jeff Immelt","So, Trevor, thanks to everybody. I just, I think the team feels really good about how we did on delivering our commitments in 2012. We\u2019ve identified very clearly our 2013 commitments, which we believe are very competitive against our peers and we\u2019re going to be off executing against that going forward.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great. Thanks Jeff. Just to wrap up, everyone, the replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We\u2019ll be distributing our quarterly supplemental data schedule for GE Capital shortly after this call.

(Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew Cribbins","Great, thank you. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s third quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release presentation and GE Supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff Bornstein, and our Vice President, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Kieran Murphy. We\u2019ve asked Kieran to join to talk about our life sciences business.","Now with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Matt. We continue to plan against the global macro backdrop to this volatile and one where some economic projections of recent been revised downwards. That said, we are seeing solid pockets of underlying growth in many of our markets. The good news for us is that we plan for volatile environment, our businesses are executing well, and we are tracking to our expectations for the year.","As a result, we had a good quarter. EPS was $0.38, an increase of 6% versus last year. Our Industrial segment profits grew by 9%. Our relative position in key markets is improving. We\u2019ve gained share in transportation, aviation, power and healthcare. We had great new products.","Orders grew by 22%. For the first time in a while we are seeing volume improving for GE Capital in the US. GE grew margins by 90 basis points. We continue to generate benefits from our simplification efforts and are on track for more than $1 billion of costs out for the year.","Margins improved in six or seven businesses and our costs out momentum are strong. We remain on track for CFOA for the year. So we are running the company well. And we are executing on our portfolio strategy.","We launched the Synchrony IPO in July and as we move forward this will dramatically reduce the size of GE Capital and our presence in consumer finance and we\u2019ve invested in platforms like Milestone Aviation, a helicopter leasing business linked to GE Aviation.","So we are on track to create a smaller GE Capital focused on commercial finance. At the same time, we announced the sale of Appliances a legacy GE business. The Synchrony spend, Appliances sale and also some acquisition from the second quarter, are all a part of repositioning GE to be the world\u2019s best infrastructure and technology company with a smaller financial services division.","This is a more valuable GE with 75% of our earnings from industrial by 2016. We are winning in the market. Orders were robust in the quarter growing 22% and this was driven by 31% equipment orders growth and 10% growth in services. Orders pricing was positive in the third quarter.","Technology drives high margin share and we took orders for more than a 1000 Tier-4 compliant locomotives in the quarter and are ahead of the competition. Aviation continues to enjoy a great success with LEAP wins, GEnx share growth and the GE9X launch orders.","For the first time in a while, power and water equipment orders grew in the United States, up 41%. We now have 13 H turbines in backlog and we are enjoying good success in oil and gas as Subsea orders growing by 63% and the launch of the 20K Blow Out Preventer.","NPIs are helping healthcare to grow in the United States and new innovations are helping LEDs to grow orders by 60% and power conversion by 30%.","Service orders grew by 10% with growth in five of the six businesses, aviation and commercial spares were up 29% and power gen services grew by 10% despite some sluggish end-use markets.","Last week, we announced new analytical applications and that our predictivity solution revenues will exceed $1 billion in 2014. Orders growth was broad based geographically, US orders were strong with growth of 25% and growth markets expanded by 34% with five of nine regions up in the quarter.","These include Chine up 26%, orders from the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey doubled, Latin America was up 54%, Africa up 9% and Canada up 46%. Backlog is a record of $250 billion, up more than $20 billion in the past 12 months.","We had a service backlog true-up in aviation driven by finalization of terms with CFM for LEAP, which reduced the total by $2 billion, nonetheless were at record high. Strong orders positioned GE for sustained growth in the fourth quarter and beyond.","Segment profits grew by 9% with six of seven segments expanding. Year-to-date segment profit is up 10% driven by 5% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion.","Organic growth was up 4% in the quarter and 5% year-to-date, aviation and transportation remained very strong with equipment growth of more than 10%. Oil and gas organic growth was up 10%.","We saw a strong US environment in healthcare and power and water had sub-comps in the third quarter, while we have a very strong fourth quarter shipments versus last year. And for the year, our industrial organic growth should be at the high end of our framework.","We had another strong quarter on margins of 16.3% up 90 basis points. Big drivers continue to be value gap productivity and simplification and we expect this to continue. Year-to-date margins are up 50 basis points and service margins have grown by 170 basis points year-to-date.","With service orders growing by 10% and strong margin expansion, we are seeing some of the early signs that our investment has started paying off.","We remain on track to growing industrial segment profits by 10% at least this year. We\u2019ve generated $7.2 billion of CFOA year-to-date and are on track for $14 billion to $17 billion for the year. For the quarter, we grew CFOA by 41%.","GE Capital dividends are on track for $3 billion in the year. We will generate substantial CFOA in the fourth quarter driven by much higher industrial earnings and stronger shipments than last year.","We continue to have strong liquidity and balance sheet strength, GE Capital Tier-1 ratio was 12.1%, up 80 basis points and we are targeting buyback and dividends of more than $11 billion for the year.","In addition, we expect the Synchrony split to take GE shares below $9.5 billion by the end of 2015. Our capital allocation continues to be disciplined and balanced.","Now let me turn you over to Kieran Murphy who is the leader of our Global Life Sciences business. This is a strong GE franchise with expanding organic growth, margins and cash flow. Kieran joined GE in 2008 and has 25 years of experience in the life sciences industry.","Kieran Murphy","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and thanks for giving me the opportunity to tell you more about life sciences, a $3.7 billion business within GE Healthcare. The healthcare industry is moving towards a more precise diagnosis with more precise treatment to address an annual waste of $350 billion since most around 90% of currently marketed drugs, only work for about 40% of people.","Precision medicine would improve patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs and this is driving the demand for biologics as opposed to chemical medicines improving efficacy, and reducing side-effects.","We are in a central component of drug manufacture for this industry. Our presence in life sciences extends from the research lab where we helped in the discovery of new medicines to the manufacturing plants where we deliver capacity and productivity.","And then, all the way to supporting clinicians who use our diagnostic agents to make refined diagnosis for tens of millions of patients around the world every year. The expansion of biological medicines for the treatment of diabetes, cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases drives demand for GE products and services which are embedded in biopharmaceutical dugs.","Today, these drugs make up six of the top ten revenue generating medicines. Also, in the emerging markets, particularly China, there is a growing market need for generic bio-drugs called bio-similars. This has the potential to be a significant growth opportunity over the next five to ten years.","And the next evolution of medicines regenerative medicine, which is based on regenerating cells, tissues and organs in the body is an area where GE is investing for the future. All of this adds up to a market growing at around 8% per year.","We have a broad portfolio of products which has driven into two main areas, bioprocessing and research serving academics and pharmaceutical customers and diagnostics, aimed primarily at clinicians.","For biopharma manufacturing, we have a leading global franchise built on a portfolio of products we acquired with the Amersham acquisition in 2004 and we\u2019ve continued to build value through successful R&D investments and a series of strategic deals resulting in a comprehensive offering that enables start to finish solutions for production.","This start to finish solution creates productivity opportunities for our customers and I\u2019ll return to that later.","Our Research & Applied Markets business has a series of strong brands for protein characterization, purification and analysis, critical to the discovery of these new medicines, once selected, these consumables remain embedded in the scale of drug all the way to an FDA approved manufacturing process.","Within the Diagnostics business, we are the global leader in contrast agents used across the spectrum of diagnostic imaging, including X-ray, MRI and nuclear medicines. We supply customers through a global network of large-scale low-cost manufacturing facilities.","With novel in vitro technologies developed at the GERC we have expanded our service offering to allow researchers to better understand the underlying biology of diseases, which of course in turn reaches the development of the new precision medicines which we then help to manufacture.","And that brings me on to how critical we are to the biopharmaceutical manufacturing industry. Over the past six years, biological medicine sales have grown a 10% per annum to $170 billion, due primarily to the expansion of molecular antibody for the treatment of cancer and increasing demand for products like insulin. Our hardware and consumables are embedded in the FDA approved manufacturing process of these products.","This manufacture of biologics is completely different to the industrial process for making traditional chemical-based medicine. It requires cells to grow, to produce specific protein, which are then extracted and purified. This is an $8 billion market where have got the leading position, all starting from the pharmacy chromatography platform which was part of Amersham.","We continue to build on this products and service platform organically as well as through deals, moving upstream with a series of acquisitions such as WAVE and Xcellerex, which added fomenters and disposable technologies to the portfolio and recently, HyClone Cell Media, part of the $1 billion acquisition from Thermo Fisher. This creates the start to finish solution I referred to earlier.","We enjoyed close strategic partnerships with the leading pharmaceutical companies who depend on us for reliable, high quality supply. The move to biological medicines that has driven double-digit growth over the past few years will continue as expansion in Asia creates new demand for manufacturing capacity.","We are uniquely positioned to help in this expansion or for global pharma companies wanting to localize production in new markets and for local manufacturers wanting to establish domestic production of crucial medicine.","We effectively partner to deliver factory interface solutions. Our FlexFactory and KUBio solutions can provide a complete factory in less than half the time required for traditional plants, 36 months to less than 18 and at a fraction of the costs.","Essentially, we provide a faster and more cost-effective way of creating capacity and access to the emerging markets.","Lastly, we are investing in the cells therapy or regenerative medicine space. An example of this would be the creation of cells for example robust IVDs. The bottleneck right now in this industry is to move from research of small-scale to industrial-scale production and this is an area where we can bring our bioprocessing tools and expertise to enable this revolutionary change in medicine.","It\u2019s an emerging market where we have low revenues today, but we see it having the potential to create $1 billion in the future.","In summary, the Life Sciences business is a high margin, high quality growth business within GE. We are a trusted supplier for the pharmaceutical industry for biopharmaceutical research and manufacturing.","GE Healthcare\u2019s deep relationships with hospitals provides greater access for sales growth and diagnostic and research products. We leverage GE\u2019s great strength in research and analytics from the global research and our software center in San Ramon. We use the global operations and commercial teams across the world to sell into emerging markets.","This is a business where in 2014 we are delivering strong growth, especially in bioprocessing with margins expanding by 100 basis points through business integration and organizations and litigations. And we are generating in excess of $1 billion free cash flow.","Overall, the dealer turn for this business is in the low teens. This is a growing and valuable business within GE and we continue to see healthy pipeline and have great confidence in the future growth of the business. And now I would like to hand over to Jeff Bornstein.","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks, Kieran. I\u2019ll start with the third quarter summary. We had revenues of $36.2 billion, up 1% from the third quarter of 2013. Industrial sales of $26 billion were up 3% and GE Capital revenues of $10.5 billion were down 1%.","Operating earnings of $3.8 billion were up 3% in the quarter. Operational earnings per share of $0.38 were up 6%, continuing EPS of $0.34 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. With a small benefit in discontinued operations this quarter associated with touring of taxes on the Grey Zone payment.","As Jeff said, CFO year-to-date was $7.2 billion, with industrial CFOA of $5 billion and received $2.2 billion of dividends from GE capital. In the quarter , industrial generated $3 billion of CFOA, up $900 million versus the third quarter of 2013. For the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver on the $14 billion to $17 billion framework we provided.","The GE tax rate for the quarter was 18% and that brings the year-to-date rate for the industrial company to 20%. We expect the total year rate to be in the high teens. The GE Capital rate was 2% for the quarter and that was consistent with the low single-digit total year rate that we previously communicated.","On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 3% reported and up 4% organically. Industrial segment operating profit was up 9% and GE Capital earnings were down 22% on lower assets, the Synchrony minority interest impact and lower tax benefits.","I\u2019ll cover the dynamics of each of the segments in the next couple of pages.. First I\u2019ll start with other items for the quarter. We had $0.03 of restructuring other charges at corporate, $0.02 of that related to ongoing industrial researching and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the industrial cost structure.","We also added $0.01 charge related to the announced Appliances disposition. We\u2019ve moved the business to held for sale and recognized prior service costs related to pension and retiree held for Appliances supporting these.","On a pre-tax basis, that was a $113 million of the total $435 million restructuring and other charges we incurred in the quarter. I want to give an update on industrial cost dynamics.","On the left side, you can see our research and engaged profiles, for the year, we expect to invest about $1.4 billion in restructuring and other charges with about $1.2 billion incurred through the first three quarters of the year.","We had gains to a share of about a penny from the Wayne disposition and so for the year, we are expecting restructuring net of gains to be about $0.09. We\u2019d like to pay back and the operating leverage that we are getting from these projects.","The average payback is about a year and a half, approximately 55% of these projects relate to product and operating costs and the rest is associated with SG&A. On the right side, I\u2019ll give you a quick update on two important costs out events. First on structural SG&A, we\u2019ve taken out $674 million year-to-date on our way to over $1 billion for the year. As a result of these actions, industrial SG&A as a percent of sales has come down steadily.","Year-to-date, we are down 1.6 points versus 2013. We expect to be above 14% for the year driven by an additional $300 million plus of costs out in fourth quarter and strong volumes.","In corporate, we\u2019ve taken actions to reduce our operating cost as well. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve taken out $436 million through simplification efforts at corporate headquarters, GGO and reductions in our social costs. For the year, we expect to deliver more than the $500 million target we established at the start of the year.","As Jeff said, industrial segment op profit is up 10% year-to-date. When you look at industrial including corporate, operating profit was up 17% year-to-date, 19% in the quarter. This excludes the investments we\u2019ve made in restructuring net of gains and the MBCU income we had in 2013.","So I\u2019ll start with the segment summaries, first, power and water. Orders in the quarter of $6.4 billion were higher by 9%, equipment orders were up 8% driven by strong renewables up 42% partially offset by distributed power down 32% and thermal down 8%.","Renewables saw strength in Europe, Latin America, and the US despite the later than expected IRS clarification of PTC eligibility. Distributed power continues to see projects push. We booked about 30% of the units that pushed in the second quarter, but saw some projects pushed to the fourth quarter in 2015.","We believe all these projects are viable, but are located in tougher regions like Egypt, Libya, Angola and Kazakhstan. Thermal orders were down on four lower gas turbines, but higher on a gigawatt basis driven by the large H class order in the US from Exelon.","This brings our total eight units of backlog to 13. We now expect total year gas turbine unit orders to be about 105 to 110, versus 125, driven by disruption in the Middle East and some US customers are shifting from F class to H class technology. This shift is required some of our customers to re-permit the sites and has delayed some orders.","Service orders in the quarter were up 10%. We had strong orders for upgrades and transactional outage volumes as discussed in the second quarter call. And AGPs in the quarter were 18 versus 15 a year ago. Revenue of 6.4 billion in the quarter was down 2%.","With Equipment down 8% and services up 6%. Equipment revenue was driven by distributed power down 35% on 24 fewer units versus last year, partially offset by strong renewables up 18%. Revenue was a little lower than expected, wind units were 150 less than planned driven by late IFRS guidance but we still expect to ship above 3000 units for the year.","Distributed power was also lower by about 10 units as projects were delayed. On gas turbine units we\u2019ve shipped 64 units year-to-date and now expect to ship about 105 in the year versus the 85 to 90 we planned.","Service revenues in the quarter of $2.9 billion were up 6% on higher AGPs and upgrades. From an operating profit perspective, we were at just shy of $1.2 billion, was down 8% driven by negative price and mix from higher wind and lower distributed power, which more than offset cost benefits including SG&A which was down 10%. Margins were down 110 basis points in the quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we expect strong double-digit revenue growth on higher gas turbine shipments, up above 40% and higher wind turbines up above 30% bringing the total year shipments to about 105 on gas turbines and about 3000 wind turbines which is within the original framework.","As discussed on the second quarter call, we still expect total year AGPs to be higher and distributed power units to be lower impacted by the delays we discussed previously.","In oil and gas, orders at $4.9 billion were up 10%, equipment orders were up 14%, up 20% organically excluding the impact of the Wayne disposition. We had strength in Subsea up 84% with strong Brazilian orders, downstream technology up 64%driven by demand in small-scale LNG, partially offset by DNS which was down 12% in the quarter.","Service orders were up 6% where strength in Subsea up 27% and turbo machinery up 8%, partially offset by MNC which was down 8%. Organically, MNC was up 7% with demand for control solutions improving in both industrial and oil and gas applications.","Revenues of $4.6 billion grew 7% year-over-year with equipment revenues higher by 9%, and services up 4%. Operating profit of $660 million was up 27%, on strong cost performance, project execution and a positive value gap offset by lower MNC mix. Margin rates expanded in the quarter 240 basis points. Our outlook for the year remains intact for the business with double-digit op profit growth.","However, we are moderating our view of orders growth from high single-digits to low double-digits to mid-single-digits. We expect orders to grow in the fourth quarter. As you know orders in the space are very volatile and we continue to see some big projects pushed to the right.","Next I\u2019ll do aviation and healthcare, starting with aviation. Travel demand continues to grow with RBK\u2019s August year-to-date up 5.1% domestically, and up 6.3% internationally. Orders for aviation were very strong in the quarter up 30% with equipment orders up 35% and $6.8 billion and services higher by 20%.","Equipment strength was led by $3.8 billion of GE 9X orders for Emirates, Etihad and Lufthansa. We also won $1.3 billion of CFM LEAP orders bringing our program today win rate on the next-end narrow bodies to 78%. Military equipment orders were down 40%, but up 3% year-to-date and are on track to be flat for the year.","Service orders were driven by strong commercial spares up 29% to $30.9 million a day, partially offset by military spares weakness. Revenues in the quarter is up $5.7 billion were up 6% driven by commercial equipment revenue up 22%, military up 8% and services down 1%.","Commercial spares were up 19% offset by military services down 17%. Leverage in the operating profit was strong with 16% growth on better price performance and volume, partly offset by higher GEnx shipments with 65 units in the quarter, up 39 from the third quarter of 2013.","SG&A ex-Avio was down 4% in the quarter and margins expanded to 190 basis points. Overall, David and the aviation team delivered a strong quarter, we expect the aviation business to continue to expand its technology leadership. GEnx shipments will be higher in the fourth quarter and we still expect to ship about 300 units for the year.","In healthcare, orders were up 1%, with better growth in the US which was up 3%, Europe was up 4% and Latin America was up 18%. This was offset by Japan down 12% and the Middle East down 15% in the quarter.","Equipment orders of $2.7 billion were flat on lower Japan and Middle East orders. Our US equipment orders were up 4% driven by very strong imaging and ultrasound orders which were up 10%. We believe the US market was up as well but more modestly.","China ACS equipment orders were up 6% in the third quarter and they are up 11% year-to-date. China growth was slower driven by tender decision delays in public hospitals. In Kieran\u2019s business, Life Sciences, equipment orders were strong, up 15% and service orders for healthcare total were up 4%.","Revenues in the quarter were up 4% with developed markets up 2% and emerging markets up 11% including China up 10%, Latin America up 30%, and the Middle East up 16%. Op profit grew 9% driven by volume and strong cost productivity offset by negative price. SG&A was down 5% in the quarter.","Looking forward we expect US to remain volatile, but our products are performing well. Our position in china is very strong and we believe underlying healthcare demand remains strong in the long run with an aging population, increasing insurance coverage and continued government spend in healthcare.","As you heard today, we have a very exciting life sciences business with a unique position. Simplification will continue to transform our cost structure in this business.","Next is transportation which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter were up 134% led by equipment orders up three times or $2.1 billion. The business took orders for more than a Tier-4 compliant locomotives to be delivered over the next three years.","Locomotive loading is nearing current capacity levels for 2015. Car loads continue to be strong led by agriculture, petroleum and intermodal and network velocity continues to be a challenge.","Mining equipment orders remain weak down 38%, transportation service orders were up 8% in the quarter. Revenues were up 10% driven by locomotive volume with units up 49% partially offset by services down 3% on mining weakness.","Operating profit was higher by 12% driven by local volume and cost productivity and SG&A was down 5% and that allowed margins to improve 40 basis points in the quarter. We are very pleased with the team\u2019s execution on the Tier-4 loco and expect to continue to fill out our order book for 2016 and 2017 and we feel great about our ability to execute against this order growth.","Energy management, the business continues to improve. Our orders in the quarter were down 1% with digital energy down 25%, industrial solutions down 7% on weak European demand and the impact of exiting certain markets and products as part of restructuring.","Power conversion was strong, up 30% in the quarter driven by marine. Backlog grew 9%. Revenues up $1.8 billion were down 1%, op profit of $59 million was up three times on strong cost and restructuring execution.","And then appliances and lighting, the core industry within appliances was up 9% in the third quarter, retail was up 9% and contract up 7%. Revenue in the quarter was up 1% to $2.1 billion with appliances up 2% and lighting down 2%. Appliance revenue was driven by volume up 3%, while strong LED growth of 59% and lighting was more than offset by traditional product declines.","Operating profit of $88 million was higher by 14% on strong productivity and SG&A was down 11% and margins expanded 15 basis points. As we announced in early September, we reached an agreement with Electrolux to sell our Appliance business. We hope to close that transaction in mid-2015.","Next I\u2019ll cover GE Capital. As you know, we successfully completed the IPO of 15% of our North American retail finance business, now known as Synchrony Financial. It\u2019s a publicly traded company, CEO, Margaret Keane and the team will host their own investor call later this morning. We continue to make progress on separation efforts and expect the split out to take place towards the end of 2015 subject to regulatory approval.","In the meantime, Synchrony will remain consolidated in GE Capital Financials. GE Capital\u2019s revenue of $10.5 billion was down 1%, primarily from lower assets partially offset by higher gains. GE Capital\u2019s net income of $1.5 billion was down 22% principally driven by lower assets which includes minority interest impact resulting from the Synchrony IPO and lower tax benefits.","Earnings were affected by the timing of our Nordics consumer platform exit which is previously announced moved from the third to the fourth quarter. E&I of $365 billion was down $19 billion or 5% from last year and down $7 billion sequentially. Non-strategic E&I was down $11 billion or 8% versus last year.","Net interest margin in the quarter was 5% which is essentially flat. GE Capital\u2019s Tier-1 common ratio on a Basel-1 basis remains in a strong position and ended the quarter at 12.1%. This is up 40 basis points sequentially and 79 points year-over-year.","Our liquidity levels are also strong and we ended the quarter with $80 billion of cash with $15 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we have substantially completed our long-term debt issuance for the year at $9.4 billion. On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be strong and stable.","Now I\u2019ll walk through each of the segments. The commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with 170 billion of assets flat to last year on book core volume was $10 billion up 5% driven by increases in both the Americas and international. We continued to see strengthening in the US largely in equipment financing with volume up 7%.","The team is staying disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles, and the new business returns on both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first half of the year. Earnings of $617 million were up 29% driven by lower marks and impairments primarily in our corporate air book as well as higher gains and tax benefits.","The consumer segment ended the quarter with $141 billion of assets, up 4% from last year driven by Synchrony. Net income was $621 million, down 31%. As I mentioned earlier,","Synchrony team will cover all the details of their quarter in a call later this morning. Our share of their earnings was $509 million, down 25% net of minority interest and investment in its standalone capabilities.","The international consumer business was down as well from the effect of lower assets which were down 16% year-over-year, consistent with last quarter. In real estate assets of $36 billion were down 9% versus prior year. The equity book is down 28% from a year ago to $12 billion.","Net income of $175 million was down 62%, primarily from non-repeat of prior year tax benefits. In the current quarter, we sold 72 properties from our real estate equity book with a book value of roughly $0.5 billion for $122 million in gains.","In the verticals, GECAS earned $133 million, down 23% from lower assets and tax benefits. Impairments including our annual review completed this quarter resulted in a $197 million after-tax impact, roughly in line with the third quarter of last year. The impairments are driven by value declines in 50 seater regional jets, older-767s and older A320s.","Overall, the portfolio is in great shape and we finished the quarter once again with no aircraft on the ground and zero delinquencies. We do not anticipate any updates in the fourth quarter to the GCAS impairment process. New volume was much stronger at $1.4 billion, up 62% with very attractive returns in line with the first half of the year.","As Jeff mentioned before, we were excited to announce the Milestone acquisition on Monday. The acquisition combines GCAS global reach and leasing expertise with a growing helicopter financing business that will diversify our business and put our capital to work at good returns.","This is in line with GE Capital\u2019s strategy to grow in the mid-market and industrial vertical space where we have deep domain expertise and are competitively advantaged. The deal is expected to close in 2015 pending regulatory approvals.","Energy finance earned $61 million, down 59% resulting from lower assets and gains and higher impairments. EFS volume was up strongly at 152% year-over-year at very attractive returns.","As you look forward to the fourth quarter, we expect GE Capital to be about $1.8 billion in earnings including the gain from exiting of our Nordics business. However, we continue to aggressive work on opportunities to reduce the size of non-strategic portfolio. And these transactions could impact earnings and tax and the tax rate in the fourth quarter.","So overall, Keith and the team continue to execute the portfolio strategy and deliver solid operating results. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffery Immelt","Thanks, Jeff. We remain on track for a 2014 operating framework. Industrial segment earnings were driven by sustained organic growth and margin expansion and are expected to grow by at least 10% this year. GE Capital is on track with higher earnings in the fourth quarter, due to the timing of the Nordic consumer finance platform sale.","Corporate is on track as expected and as expected, corporate has been a drag in 2014 because of restructuring investments exceed gains. However, this will be a real tailwind in 2015.","Cash and revenues remain on track and we expect fourth quarter organic revenue to be robust. Despite a volatile global environment, GE expects to have a good fourth quarter and deliver on our 2014 framework. In addition, we are changing the portfolio to position GE for long-term growth.","The GE team has done a good job of both strategic and operational execution. With a big backlog, high levels of recurring revenue and a restructuring program already in place,, we believe that GE will deliver for investors in times like these.","Now, Matt let\u2019s turn it back over to you and take some questions.","Matthew Cribbins","All right, thanks, Jeff, Why don\u2019t we open up and take some questions now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions) Our first question comes from Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi. Good morning guys.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Scott","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Appreciate the detail on the presentation. It's really helpful. Guys, I wanted to get your sense, I mean, if you look at the markets, it\u2019s kind of telling you that the world is falling apart, but then we see the numbers here and they look pretty \u2013 pretty darn good overall, and overall in the space haven't been that bad. I mean, \\what are your customers telling you? I mean, is \u2013 are we at a risk of a real pullback in customer activity as we get into the fourth quarter just based on this new growth contagion that\u2018s out there \u2013 this growth fear?","Jeffrey Immelt","You know, Scott, I just give you a view of the world and again, there is certainly lot going on but I would say, the US is probably the best we\u2019ve seen it since the financial crisis, right, when you look at rail loadings and things like that, you\u2019ve got a decent and healthy US market. Europe is slower for sure.","But I think most companies, industrial companies haven\u2019t counted on Europe and Japan for much incremental growth. And then if you go across the emerging markets and I was two weeks ago the Middle East and North Africa still pretty healthy robust. China, I think is more of a micro story then macro story now.","Aviation, healthcare very strong, if you are in the right industries, very robust. Mexico better. So if you look at it geographically Scott, I think it\u2019s kind of the slow growth pattern with volatility but a not a lot different than what we\u2019ve seen in the past and then kind of industry-by-industry, Aviation remains strong, transportation remains strong, power, depends on what segments you are in.","Or I guess, you definitely have more caution in oil and gas, but I\u2019ve been with a bunch of the CEOs just in the last couple days and the long-term projects I think are still kind of underway.","But there is certainly, I would say, there was already caution before the last, I would say, month or so around there. So, I think it fits a pattern that we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years and the underlying activity is still reasonably healthy but not universal. There are some parts that are clearly stronger than others.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, fair enough. And just, healthcare, it's kind of unusual for you guys to make a big management change like that in the middle of a quarter or a middle of the year, I should say. The healthcare numbers were pretty good. I mean, what was it, Jeff, that you didn't like about the direction of what\u2019s going on in healthcare that really catalyzed the change there?","Jeffrey Immelt","You know, Scott, these things were always individual-by-individual. I think, John Dineen was a really good leader here; I think he has got good opportunities as you saw yesterday he has got a nice new assignment and sometimes I just think it works for the individual and for the company.","So, again, I think the healthcare business is still a key business for us. But, yes, it gives us a new set of eyes and I think in John\u2019s case, the future makes sense for him as well.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","I normally don't ask three questions, but, what people are asking questions. Why put a non-healthcare, non-domain experienced guy into a business like this?","I mean, Jeff, you\u2019ve said in the past that, you really want more domain expertise within the businesses and John is \u2013 I think he is very good obviously, but it came it\u2019s a little bit strange to put a non-healthcare guy in charge of the healthcare business. I mean, can you just explain that a little bit and then I\u2019ll pass it on?","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, Scott, look, I love Flannery\u2019s global experience. I thought that was outstanding. He has got a great strategic buying to put. He has more experience in healthcare than I had when I became of CEO of healthcare more than 10 years ago. So, I think he has got a nice \u2013 really a nice background and has real hands on experience with it outside the United States.","","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks guys.","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, thanks, Scott.","","Operator","The next question comes from Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, good morning.","Jeffrey Immelt","Morning Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, so I was quite obviously very pleased to get the detail on Life Sciences \u2013 a real gem of an asset. But relatively small in the theme of things, so I am wondering, Jeff, is this a business that you want to grow a bit more aggressively going forward from here?","Jeffrey Immelt","Well, you know, there is still \u2013 maybe I\u2019ll start and then Kieran turn it over to you. I think in the bioprocess manufacturing, we\u2019ve been able to do bolt-on acquisitions behind organic growth and I think that\u2019s been a great GE success factor over time. So, I think that\u2019s falling of those one that we continue to make \u2013 get experience with.","And then the other side on the diagnostic pharma side, Nigel, that\u2019s more of a heavy R&D side. Right, so I would say, maybe bolt-on acquisitions on the bioprocess manufacturing, maybe some R&D collaborations, but I don\u2019t see a big deal. And now Kieran why don\u2019t I turn it to you?","","Kieran Murphy","Yes, I agree Jeff. Look, I think the prognosis for growth for this business is actually very strong. We have a great portfolio, especially in the bioprocessing space, we\u2019ve done some nice deals here to give ourselves this stuff to finish to the receptor on the pitch and there is no question that with the innovation in medicine moving more towards biology and really strong continued growth in monoclonal antibodies, we are in a great position to serve that market.","And of course, if you look at what\u2019s happening in the emerging markets, especially in places like China, and the need for infrastructure, I think our solutions are ideally suited to that. So, I see a greater opportunity for growth.","From our standpoint, the GE infrastructure globally gives us such a great reach into the markets, especially as with things like China, the Middle East and Latin America, that the infrastructure of GE gives us a great backbone to actually reach into these markets and do projects in difficult situations.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks. And then, Jeff, as a follow-on expressing confidence in the 7% organic for the year is obviously encouraging given the headlines, but you clearly have the backlog in place, but you talked about some deferrals into 4Q, maybe 2015, in oil and gas and perhaps power.","So I am wondering to what extent that you are concerned that perhaps these delays might push into 2015 and therefore maybe 4Q comes in a bit weaker? So what gives you confidence that GE can get the 7% for the year?","Jeffrey Immelt","I would talk about \u2013 I wanted to \u2013 the power stuff is really the hub of \u2013 kind of- I guess our confidence and I don\u2019t know, Jeff do you want to?","","Jeffrey Bornstein","","Yes, I mean, we have fourth quarter in front of us that we think is kind of be very strong. Just for instance, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, our gas serving shipment is going to be up more than 40% year-over-year. Our wind shipments will be up more than 30% year-over-year. Aero shipments 16%, even commercial and military engines are going to be up mid double-digits and we are looking for a 30% increase in locos year-over-year. So we are looking at a fourth quarter that we think is going to be very strong and we expect the power business to be up substantially in the fourth quarter.","","Jeffrey Immelt","","And this stuff \u2013 that\u2019s already cited and financed and then backlog and stuff like that.","","Jeffrey Bornstein","","Yes, for the most part, most of the gas turbines or 100% of the gas turbines are in backlog, we are in good shape on wind. So a good part of the volume that drives the fourth quarter.","We stand pretty firmly on \u2013 I would say, as I\u2019ve said before, distributed power is the place where we have seen the most volatility and based on the places we are selling, I think, that\u2019s going to continue to play out that way. But, I think, we feel good about a strong revenue quarter in the fourth quarter.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","That's very helpful and just a quick follow-on to that. So, obviously based on equipment orders, shipments in place for 4Q, normally that would dent margins, but you had service margins up so strong in this quarter. So, I am wondering, can you maybe add some color on where you look for margin in 4Q as well?","Jeffrey Bornstein","No, we continue to progress on where we expect to continue to progress on margins. We are on this journey to 17 plus percent 2016, we got, we\u2019re 50 basis points up third quarter year-to-date. And we expect to be on that trajectory to get to 17% in 2016. So, we would expect to continue to progress.","","Jeffrey Immelt","","I just think tailwinds, the micro stuff, SG&A is good, value gap is good and I think the service productivity actually has good momentum as well.","","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","","The next question comes from Steven Winoker. Please go ahead.","","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Thanks and good morning.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Steve.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Hey, so, maybe just it's been a little while now that you\u2019ve been moving forward with Alstom. How has your thinking continued to progress as the time has passed? We got another quarter of information behind us from Alstom and within your business. Where are you in the process and how are you thinking about the opportunity now versus a few months ago?","","Jeffrey Immelt","You know, Steve, here is what, again, we\u2019re just in the process itself. I think the regulatory stuff is all going per schedule. We haven\u2019t seen anything that is a surprise. They are in the same markets out that you guys see every day.","So, some good some bad on that, but, not a big surprise there and I would say synergies, the opportunities for synergies are probably greater than what we would have expected and so we continue to work on that. So, I think, other than that, I don\u2019t really \u2013 there is not a lot more color I can add \u2013 I\u2019ll do more at the outlook meeting on Alstom. But, I\u2019d say, we still like what we see. We still think there is good potential to run it as a combined entity better.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford Bernstein","Okay and then, maybe just going \u2013 diving a little bit into the order price profile on, Slide 3 obviously it\u2019s pretty positive across most of those segments and then we saw yet another quarter where healthcare was negative and kind of used to that at this point.","And obviously, you called out the positives going on in life science. So maybe just continue to give us a little understanding, obviously this must be within systems. And kind of what\u2019s happening? Is there any change here?","How the Affordable Care Act you are seeing sort of play out so far? And maybe, are you looking at this thing with a little more of a fresh eye these days, just some thoughts on that front?","Jeffrey Immelt","You know, I think healthcare has been, everything else being equal reasonably consistent for quite a long period of time. I mean, we have seen quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year equipment pricing in the down 140 basis points, roughly 150 basis points at a point in time.","A little bit better on service. But I don\u2019t think we see anything that would suggest that the dynamics around those product cycles, the market behavior, around price is changing. So, we are very focused on winning with technology and gaining share that way and as I said, we had a reasonably for the first time \u2013 reasonably strong equipment market here in the US for us up 10%.","We don\u2019t think the market was up that. So, we need to win on technology and execution and I think the price dynamics on equipment and imaging are what they are and I don\u2019t see anything changing there.","","Jeffrey Bornstein","","Steve, there is a little bit that\u2019s of healthcare on the high tech learning curve. So, you get RCM rates are equal to or greater even sometimes when the price is down because we are getting the cost down and the product as well. So, it has the unique \u2013 I would say visibility or and compared to some of other products and technologies.","","Operator","","And our next question comes from Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Steve.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","So, you got a big \u2013 obviously a big equipment number coming through in the fourth quarter. There will be a bit of a mix impact. I think you gave some color on the margin; it seems like it\u2019s going to be up.","Maybe if I just look at normal seasonality, which has been pretty consistent in the last few years and profits, 3Q to 4Q you guys have been up about 37%, 38%. Will you be up similarly in the fourth quarter from an operating profit, industrial profit perspective, so somewhere around low 6 to 6.1 type of number for the fourth quarter or it will be better than normal seasonality?","Jeffrey Bornstein","No, we expect to be up obviously with the higher volume in the fourth quarter and we expect to continue to build on the cost gains that we\u2019ve had throughout the year both in terms of SG&A and corporate cost. So, we are expecting an increase in profit.","We expect to earn more in the fourth quarter for sure and we are expecting strong double-digit revenue growth and we expect to continue to make progress on margins.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Right. So I guess from a \u2013 will it be less than the 50 BPS in the fourth quarter year-over-year? I mean it sounds well like the mix is going to be tough.","Jeffrey Immelt","We have a very heavy equipment quarter in the fourth quarter for sure. But as I said, we expect to make progress on margins for the year. We expect to stay on that trajectory to get the 17 plus percent in 2016. So, the 15 basis points in the third quarter, I would expect those to have a decent year.","","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay and then one last question just on the turbine forecast for next year. You guys have the orders are \u2013 sales are a little bit higher; orders are a little bit lower, can you still grow your turbine shipments next year at this stage of the game?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Steve, we\u2019ll give you \u2013 when we do the outlook meeting in December, we\u2019ll give you a little bit more color on kind of what we are thinking about 2015. There is also going to be there is starting to be, Steve, a higher mix on big units as well. So, you just will try to spell that all, but you definitely see the market mixing towards the bigger units.","","Operator","","And our next question comes from Deane Dray, please go ahead.","","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Deane.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Hey, on Synchrony, the timing of the split-up transaction, I know you are saying late 2015 it depends on regulatory approvals. But, for modeling purposes, what do you suggest that we\u2019d be using?","","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, you are right. We\u2019re hopeful that we can get the exchange executed in late 2015. If I were modeling actually, I think I would just model Synchrony in the year and the exchange happening on 1-1 of 2016. We can\u2019t tell you today exactly when in late 2015, I think for modeling purposes, I would have it in for the year.","","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Great, that's helpful. And then showcasing Life Sciences today, we talked a lot about growth. Maybe you can share with us what the returns have been on these investments and I don't know if you can still trace back to the returns on Amersham, but maybe start there?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, we\u2019ve looked at that. If you go back I believe Amersham was done in 2004, when we go back and look at it, over the last roughly ten years, in this business we\u2019ve collected about $10 billion of cash. Obviously, we had the Amersham investment, we have several other investments along the way.","We\u2019ve got order of magnitude $13 billion invested. If you look at business today at a $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion of EBITDA, we think the multiple, if you split it the way Kieran described it, if you think about biopharma and research there is a very multiple of EBITDA based on transactions Merck and others have done.","And the Diagnostics business being a lower multiple business, lower growth, lower margin, at 15.5 times those EBITDA numbers you get a total value of \u2013 call it 20 \u2013 I am sorry, $27 billion, $17 billion is what we got today roughly, $10 billion of cash collected versus the $13 billion we got into it.","You get a kind of something like a low teens IRR if you will like today. Now, having said that, we think Kieran has got his business accelerating from here and we are very bullish on the biopharma space and so we think the returns from here forward are going to be more attractive than that. I don\u2019t know if I answered your question.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeff Sprague. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey, Jeff.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Good morning. Just a couple quick ones. Jeff, you noted the unit outlook is a little cloudier on energy now taken the size of units that are moving up. But, I think the color in the quarter was thermal order dollars were down, but you had higher gigawatts in orders.","Can you give us a little bit of color then what is really going on, on new unit pricing and does that imply that these first H units really go out at very, very tough pricing?","Jeffrey Immelt","Sure, so, it\u2019s heavily dynamic with the H. As we talked about, we\u2019ve got 13 in backlog and we have customers \u2013 some customers that are rethinking what otherwise might have been F powered capacity with H cop powered capacity. It is generally speaking it\u2019s one H unit will replace two F units.","So, on the pricing front, the initial, these are launch orders, so the initial H orders are going to be tougher, no question about that and we\u2019ll get down the cost curve as quickly as possible.","But I think generally speaking, we think the technology has been incredibly well received and where we thought we would be if not better given the early 2014 launch of the technology. So, we feel like we are more competitive. We had a great quarter in the US, it took 11 units.","","Jeffrey Bornstein","","I think the other dynamic, Jeff, that I would talk about Jeff is, the mix of regions is probably better. So the US is probably the place where there is the most interest right now. And that has tended to be a slightly better margin type region for us. So, that\u2019s a positive.","","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","All right and I am just trying to understand kind of the disconnect between power and water order price up 1.3%.","Jeffrey Bornstein","I got you, I am sorry, Jeff. Yes, I got it, I am sorry. The H turbines, because they are new, they are not in the OPI number. There is no price to compare to last year.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay.","Jeffrey Bornstein","I am sorry. I misunderstood the question.","","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Well, you partially got what I wanted to know too; but, there was a second element implied, so I appreciate that. And then, just on, maybe stepping back to the Milestone deal, maybe I wasn't thinking about at this way, but kind of focusing on the core in GE Capital, I didn't really think that meant M&A was on the table. I thought that was probably more an organic idea. What is your appetite for M&A in Capital moving forward?","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, Jeff, here is what I\u2019d say, this is a strike zone deal for what we do in GCAS. We know how to do this. It\u2019s an operating lease business. It matches very well with our footprint geographically on where we have resources and operating capabilities deployed. We know how to manage businesses like this that are very asset-intensive and we really like what the returns look like over time.","It also lines up like GCAS does with our aviation business. So a very high percentage of this portfolio, our GE powered helicopters and we think that provides a lot of synergy. So, we\u2019ve been \u2013 I think reasonably consistent saying that we were going to continue to grow our core mid-market and industrially aligned verticals as we move forward and at the same time, we are very aggressively working the $135 billion of non-strategic parts of the portfolio and we\u2019ve got a lot of things in motion there.","So, I think, the other way you need to think about it a bit is, we\u2019ve got capital available and we\u2019d rather deploy the capital at very attractive returns than to put the capital to work in a bank at a negative carry. So, I think this makes all the sense in the world and I don\u2019t think in anyway is that inconsistent with anything we or Keith have communicated.","","Operator","","Thank you and our next question comes from John Inch, please go ahead.","","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just given these puts and takes in Power & Water between orders and heavy shipments and I know there is a \u2013 it\u2019s got such a big influence on cash flow, Jeff Bornstein, are we thinking that operating cash for the year is going to be kind of towards the lower end of the $17 billion or is it close to call?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Today, \u2013 as we sit here today, I would say we expect to be about the midpoint of the range. So we\u2019ve got a big fourth quarter in front of us, no question about it. If you think about last year we did $5.5 billion of CFOA industrial in the fourth quarter based on the earnings improvement what we expect to get from a working capital improvement by liquidating all that inventory. In the fourth quarter, we think we\u2019ve got to pass to be about mid-point of the range between $14 billion and $17 billion.","","Jeffrey Immelt","","We would have much higher industrial earnings, John, and much higher shipments. So we ought to have a good fourth quarter, I\u2019d say on cash.","","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay and then FX, one of the dynamics at GE that makes you different is just you carry high value of your equipment versus other industrial companies. So, it could be for either of you, I mean, does FX and the decline of the euro and the yen, does that open a door to Mitsubishi and Siemens really to become much more aggressive on the OE pricing that could influence sort of the dynamic going forward? How are you thinking about it based on if anything known so far?","Jeffrey Immelt","I\u2019d say, listen, a great part of our industrial footprint here is that we make protocol over the world. So, we can be flexible, but where we make product, if FX becomes that big an issue, we can be flexible about where we make products. So I don\u2019t think we are anticipating FX being a competitive issue for us.","","Jeffrey Bornstein","","I would echo that, John, I think the dynamic is really one where we\u2019ve got the right global footprint to do whatever ultimately we need to do.","","Operator","And our last question comes from Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, just a question. You sort of highlighted H turbines being successful and some of your customers really looking into them, but you also said that it requires some re-permitting. How disruptive could it be and could we see a pause in North American cycle because of that?","Jeffrey Immelt","No, as you know, I think, in North America, I think a lot of that planning is already underway. So I would say Andrew not much. I think the whole product line is well positioned and it\u2019s great to have a large block of turbines. But we also are still seeing activity on the other turbines as well.","So, I think, other than the 13, we\u2019ve got another 15 Hs that are out there kind of being globally which should enter the backlog sometime eminently and so, we are just seeing pretty good momentum there and I don\u2019t see it disrupting the \u2013 let\u2019s say the flow from commitment to order to revenue.","","Andrew Obin \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sure, now quickly if I could just squeeze one more in. Measurement and Control, could you just give us a little bit more color? How it\u2019s improving and where we are on the call within that division?","Jeffrey Immelt","So the organic, we\u2019ve done some dispositions there, Andrew. So, I think the organic is up mid-single-digits kind of range 7% something like that.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes.","Jeffrey Immelt","And so, we\u2019ve seen that be pretty decent in the last quarter.","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, I would say, excluding the disposition impacts, the M&C businesses has start to turn a little bit organically. Orders in the third quarter were up 7%, revenue was \u2013 I said in the script were up 8% and they are getting some operating leverage. And so, we\u2019ve seen a little bit of more strength in oil and gas applications and industrial applications around controls. And so we are hopeful that we are trending more positively here in the M&C business as you know that\u2019s important, it\u2019s a very profitable business for oil and gas.","Jeffrey Immelt","Matt, I want to just","Matthew Cribbins","Sure.","","Jeffrey Immelt","Before we cut off today, I think we talked a lot about execution in the quarter, but I wanted to elevate just a bit. We really remain on track to get the company at 75% industrial, 25% GE Capital, while growing EPS every year, this year next year and into the future.","And I think in addition to the good execution in the quarter, the strategic moves the company continues to make to \u2013 with Alstom, Appliances, remixing GE Capital continues to make this a more valuable company. So I think that\u2019s an addition to the current quarter operations. I think we are executing on the portfolio to create a much more valuable company.","Matthew Cribbins","Great, thank you, Jeff. Couple of quick announcements. The replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We will be distributing our quarterly supplemental data for GE Capital later today.","We have two upcoming investor events. The first on Tuesday December 16 we will hold our Annual Outlook Meeting in New York City and on Friday, January 23, we\u2019ll hold our fourth quarter 2014 earnings webcast.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon and I'll be your conference facilitator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker Vice President of Investor Communications. Please go ahead sir.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Brandon and good morning and welcome to GE's Fourth Quarter Earnings Webcast. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO Larry Culp; and CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release, presentation and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our investor website at www.ge.com\/investors.","Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Larry","Larry Culp","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Our comments are going to be a bit longer than usual this morning to help you understand where we are and where we're going. But rest assured, we'll leave as much time as we can for questions at the end.","First, I'd like to start by welcoming Steve to the GE team. I've known him for over a decade. Steve's already had positive impact here at GE and I'm sure, he'll do the same for you, our investors going forward. I'm here today because I believe in GE. There is no company on earth with a scale of GE's global reach, brand, talent and long-term customer relationships. We have leading technology in key infrastructure markets with high barriers to entry and strong aftermarket streams. We're poised to capture recurring revenues on a global installed base of almost 70,000 engines more than 70 -- 7,000 gas turbines and aero-derivatives, more than 40,000 onshore wind turbines and more than 4 million Healthcare Systems. In short, GE matters. We've identified clear opportunities to improve our performance and we are working to address them at root cause.","We have the right portfolio of strategy and I'm confident the company is capable of gaining profitable share and creating long-term value for our shareholders. So let me cover where we stand on providing an outlook. Then I'll address some of the company changes followed by updates on our results, the balance sheet, capital and power. Jamie will take you through more details on the quarter and then I'll wrap with some metrics and comments to help you frame the outlook for 2019 before Q&A.","Let's start with the outlook because investors want to know how we expect to perform financially and you should expect to come from a place of reality. Simply put the how much is important but the how is far more fundamental. We have a good line of sight in most of our businesses today including Aviation and Healthcare.","For the industrial portfolio in total, we will provide you with our outlook for organic growth and we'll do so directionally on operating margins and free cash flow. We will give you a more detailed outlook in the near term but not today. For Power, we are resetting the baseline. We are reviewing every single project and contract and digging deeper to understand costs and benefits with respect to restructuring, market and commercial execution, improvement opportunities, legacy project issues and our service operations. We're gaining more meaningful insights into the paths for near and long-term earnings and cash potential of this business. This work takes time especially with the new structure and leadership team.","In the spirit of providing you with all the information we have as soon as we have it, I'll speak to what I have found over the last 120 days. We were executing against the key priorities we laid out in June and again in October. Simply put deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power. Remember beyond Power, it's important to recognize the underlying strengths in our businesses where the story is about enhancing our competitive advantage and delivering for customers and shareholders.","With respect to delevering, we've taken the following actions: We've reduced the quarterly dividend retaining $4 billion per year; accelerated the sale of a portion of our BHGE ownership stake raising $3.7 billion; and changed the structure of our transaction with Wabtec enabling us to retain an incremental $2 billion stake. We're demonstrating our seriousness and the flexibility with respect to our decisions to recut the BHGE and Wabtec deals in particular. We closed Distributed Power for $2.8 billion of net cash in the quarter.","For the year, we signed or completed substantially all of our $20 billion industrial asset sale plan, which had targeted roughly $10 billion in proceeds. We also announced the sale of ServiceMax in the fourth quarter. We completed $8 billion of capital asset sales and other actions in the quarter bringing our total for the year to $15 billion, which were executed at book value or better. We're more than halfway through the total of $25 billion capital asset sale program, which we expect to complete this year.","Today, we have announced that we've reached an agreement in principle with the United States Department of Justice to settle the FIRREA investigation of WMC. GE will pay the United States a civil penalty of $1.5 billion consistent with our reserve recorded for this matter in the first quarter of last year. We've taken the following actions to strengthen our businesses.","In 2018, our corporate headquarters cost was $1.2 billion down $400 million from $1.6 billion in 2017. We have begun transferring a significant portion of headcount and activities that were previously managed at corporate to the segments or to third parties with over 6,500 full-time employees transferred to-date. We're confident that as we move more activity and headcount closer to those that are directly accountable, we will see additional savings.","Good examples include the recently announced agreement with Genpact around our global operations activities and the delayering and reorganization of our Global Growth Organization. Our changes in Power followed a similar approach. We have $1.6 billion of cost at Power headquarters and expect to produce that amount by $300 million for headquarter's overhead functions. And as we distribute the remaining cost to the business units, we expect that they will find additional savings over time.","We announced this week that we will be delayering the headquarter levels at Renewable Energy. And yesterday announced that we are bringing GE's grid, solar and storage assets into that business creating an end-to-end offering from renewables customers as the demand for renewable power generation and grid integration continues to grow globally. We're strengthening our senior team. We've brought in fresh eyes that are already having an impact.","We're combining new perspectives from strong external talent, proven GE leaders with domain expertise and entrepreneurial spirit, next-gen thinkers as well as leaders with deep customer relationships. From a governance perspective, Paula Reynolds joined our Board of Directors bringing extensive experience in both the Energy and Insurance industries. The majority of our Directors now are new since 2017 and I'm finding the Board deeply engaged in all matters of our business","Our audit committee also announced that they will move forward with the tender process for the appointment of GE's independent audit firm. And finally, we announced our plan to combine the digital businesses into an independently operated IoT Software business with employee equity a separate Board and the ability to raise capital and operate like a start-up. We're on the precipice of something great. We're getting a 100 years of domain and hardware expertise and growing out of our digital DNA over the last several decades.","As my friend, Jim Collins of \"good-to-great\" fame might say, it's a start. But we have much more work to do. So let me now share with you, how I've talked with our team about how we will do it. Number one, is managing first and foremost for operational performance. Preparing for the earnings call, my first month on the job showed me that we often start with corporate and bring in the business leaders including the CEO later. We turned that around this quarter holding operating reviews first and then preparing for this call. Those reviews were tightly focused on the how we can do and how do we get better, more so than how do we explain what just happened. Let me give you an example.","Previous P&L reviews focused on revenue, contribution margin and base cost and then, of course, operating profit. The same high-level framing I saw on the Board room. No more. We now get into much more operating detail, volume, price, mix, material and labor productivity overhead and operating expenses like R&D sales and marketing and G&A, all of which are critical to understanding and then improving the business.","The second is a focus on putting our customer at the center of all we do. Over the past few months, I've spent time with our customers in China, the Middle East, Europe and here in the US. I've learned that what they value is not always aligned with how we measure our own performance.","Take quality. When I ask about quality internally, I often hear about our cost of quality, which measures our issues rather than how the customer experiences us. We're shifting our perspectives so that we understand and measure ourselves the way customers do and work backwards from there. The third area is having fewer and more impactful priorities. GE has ambition like no other company I've ever seen and that's mostly a good thing but we need to focus our attention to more of the things that matter most, so we can move them the furthest.","At a company level, we've committed to the two priorities I mentioned earlier: Deleveraging the balance sheet and strengthening the businesses starting with Power. I'd now like to address some of the areas of importance that are high on my priority list. First, our high-level financial results. We ended the year with adjusted EPS of $0.65. GAAP EPS of negative $2.43 and industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. Our backlog stands at $391 billion up 5% year-on-year with equipment at $89 billion up 4%; and service at $302 billion up 5%.","For the fourth quarter, our industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion. While cash flow was negatively impacted by the weakness in Power, we were encouraged by the strong cash generation in the other businesses. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.17 and GAAP EPS of $0.08. Jamie will take you through all this in more detail in a moment.","Next to the balance sheet. As I've stated already, we are reducing our debt levels both at Industrial and GE Capital. We know full well that our shareholders own all debt obligations across GE but these are two distinct sets of businesses with different financing needs and different capital structures and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. In industrial, we are targeting a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5x over the next few years.","Our Healthcare, transportation and BHGE separations can provide sources of roughly $50 billion toward that goal. Our Healthcare team continues to prepare for public company separation and that is progressing very well. We expect to monetize up to just under 50% of our Healthcare business. I talked earlier to the GE Transportation merger with Wabtec and the amended terms to increase our cash proceeds and we will sell down our remaining 50% ownership in BHGE in an orderly manner over time building on the actions, we took in November.","Overall our liquidity position remains strong with $16.8 billion of industrial cash and funding lines of $40 billion. Now on capital, we are targeting a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 4x by 2020. In 2018, we paid down capital's external debt balance by $21 billion and we executed $15 billion in asset sales at book more than half of our $25 billion asset disposition program. Capital ended the year with a $124 billion of assets including $15 billion of liquidity in line with our goal to materially shrink this business.","To be clear, we have no plans to sell GECAS. We expect to contribute approximately $4 billion of parent support in 2019. We've listened to you on the insurance front and we're preparing increased disclosures in line with peers, which will be available with our 10-K release. Jamie will cover some of that detail shortly. And then finally on Power. Let me share with you the root causes of our underperformance as I see them today and the actions we're taking to address each one.","First as I said, last quarter we were late to embrace the realities of the secular and cyclical pressures in the business. Recent data suggests that the market for new generating capacity is settling in to the 25 to 30 gigawatts range for the foreseeable future. We continue to believe gas will play an important role in global electrification but we have to resize our cost structure, our capital expenses and our supply chains to this new reality now.","As a result last year, we reduced headcount by 10,000 or 15% in the business, consolidated our footprint by 30% and took out $900 million of base cost exiting at a $1 billion lower run rate. Embracing market reality means a more appropriate revenue outlook, one that is further grounded in the reality of our $92 billion backlog rather than in the hope of new orders not yet won. Second Power faces a number of nonoperational headwinds and we expect a high water mark in this regard this year. These include legal settlements and legacy project erosion principally driven by the Alstom acquisition. There's also the runoff of the effects of past long-term receivables factoring and other programs.","Over the next few years, these effects should come down substantially. Third, we need to execute better. Running Power better means improved daily management in how we sell make and service our products. Let me give you a few examples. We had separate teams of managers commissioning new plants owning a warranty period and overseeing the services contracts after the warranty.","Now, we present one face to the customer, who is accountable for the best long-term economic answer both for the customer and GE. We put the sales organization under one leader with deep domain expertise and are coordinating better on contract negotiations. We now have more experienced people, owning negotiations and responsible for project cost. We performed risk assessments of our existing 400 equipment contracts to identify cost and execution risks. We also performed a similar assessment on the 750 CSA contracts to identify price and utilization risk.","We have overhauled our commercial underwriting processes to set more realistic commitments and returns from the start. This is hard work but I'm encouraged by the Power's team's dedication to proactively address these issues at their root cause. Fixing Power will take time and in turn will take time for the changes, we're making to our daily operations to be reflected in our financial results but we are improving and I'm confident that those changes will come.","As I've met with customers around the world, I'm really been struck by their sentiment. They're rooting for us. They want us to succeed and they want to know how they can help. So in summary, we're taking action, taking action on the priorities we laid out to you, deleveraging our balance sheet and strengthening our businesses starting with Power.","Jamie will now take you through the detailed financial results.","Jamie Miller","Thanks. Larry. I'll start with the fourth quarter summary. Orders were $34.1 billion down 1% reported and up 4% organically with particular strength in equipment orders up 7% organically driven by aviation commercial engines and renewables. The services orders were up 1% organically. Revenues were up 5%, industrial segment revenues were up 2% reported and 8% organically driven by renewables Aviation Oil & Gas Healthcare and Transportation.","Equipment revenues grew 10% and services were up 6% organically. Industrial profit margins were 7.5% in the quarter down 150 basis points year-over-year on a reported and organic basis driven by significant declines in Power and Renewables. For the year, margins were down 80 basis points organically. Industrial profit was down 16% in the quarter with Aviation, Healthcare and Baker Hughes GE all delivering strong profit growth offset mostly by Power. Specifically Aviation had another outstanding quarter and year expanding total year margins while shipping over 1,100 LEAP engines. Net earnings per share was $0.07, which includes losses from discontinued operations related to GE Capital. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.08 and adjusted EPS was $0.17.","I'll walk the GAAP continuing EPS to adjusted EPS on the right side of the page. Starting from GAAP. Continuing EPS was $0.08 and we had $0.06 of gains principally from the sale of Distributed Power. As you will recall in the third quarter, we booked the $22 billion impairment charge related to Power goodwill based on our best estimate at that time. And during the fourth quarter, we finalized our analysis and booked an incremental $69 million charge for Power following the third quarter charge. We also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $94 million in renewables at our Hydro business. Combined these charges were $0.02 impact. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.07 of charges principally at Corporate and Power as we continue to resize those segments in line with our stated plan including $0.02 of charges related to business development transaction expenses and $0.01 for our share of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring.","Lastly, we realized a $0.01 negative impact from US tax reform as we updated our estimate of the transition tax and other aspects of the enactment of the new law. Our current accrual reflects the effects of tax reform enactment based on guidance issued through year-end. Excluding these items adjusted EPS was $0.17 in the quarter.","Moving to cash, adjusted industrial free cash flow was $4.9 billion for the quarter, $1.9 billion lower than the prior year driven primarily by a lower progress collections. Income depreciation and amortization totaled $2.3 billion. Working capital was positive $2.3 billion for the quarter as we reduced over $1 billion of inventory on a higher fourth quarter volume and grew progress collections by $500 million primarily in renewables from strong PTC-driven orders.","Contract assets were a source of cash of $900 million as we saw higher services billings in aviation driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic and we spent about $1 billion in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE. For the year, we generated $4.5 billion of adjusted industrial free cash flow and we ended the year with higher volume in the fourth quarter as is typical for our businesses. And to provide you with more detail, Power used $2.7 billion in free cash flow for the year due to a combination of restructuring costs, nonoperational headwinds as well as execution and market issues.","Next, I'll cover liquidity. On the left side of the page, you can see the walk of the GE cash balance. We ended the fourth quarter with $16.8 billion of industrial cash in the bank excluding Baker Hughes GE. And for the total year, we had industrial free cash flow of $4.5 billion. We paid dividends of $4.2 billion and as of the first quarter of 2019, you'll recall that the dividend is decreasing to $0.01 per share per quarter, which will preserve about $4 billion of cash in 2019. We generated cash proceeds of $5.9 billion net of taxes related to our industrial disposition principally Industrial Solutions, Value-Based Care and Dis Power. And together with Wabtec that gets to the more than $10 billion we had talked about previously.","Earlier in the year, we assumed $6 billion of debt from GE Capital to fund the principal pension plan, which was completed in the third quarter. Alstom and GE exercised their JV redemption rights and call options, which we settled for $3.1 billion in the fourth quarter. These entities operate at a loss. So the consolidation of 100% of the financials negatively impacted fourth quarter and will be an income headwind for us of about $300 million in 2019. We also completed a secondary offering for approximately 100 million Baker Hughes GE shares as well as a direct stock buyback with Baker Hughes GE for 65 million shares bringing our ownership stake to 50.4% in the fourth quarter.","These actions combined with other Baker Hughes GE buybacks during the year totaled $4.4 billion in cash proceeds. The $2.5 billion of other cash includes a number of items including about $900 million of investments in our Aviation business primarily from the first half of the year; $900 million of short data derivative hedge settlements that we used to mitigate risks across the portfolio; and $400 million of FX translation on our non-US dollar-denominated cash. Running with a higher cash balance will help us address inter-quarter funding needs. In line with our goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, peak short-term funding needs declined from $19.7 billion in the fourth quarter of '17 to $14.8 billion in the fourth quarter of '18. These were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our credit facilities.","As we execute dispositions in 2019, we expect our intra-quarter funding needs to continue to decline and would expect to use a mix of commercial paper, credit facilities and excess cash at GE Capital to efficiently fund these needs. At the end of the year, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to $40 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. These lines are available to draw at any time and they don't have financial covenants ratings triggers or material adverse change clauses. As you know, our credit rating was downgraded from A to BBB+ with a stable outlook in early fourth quarter.","This impact has been manageable with less than $15 million of collateral postings and a smooth transition to a Tier two commercial paper program. We continue to target a sustainable rating in the single A range.","Now, I'll take you through financial policy and leverage. We remain committed to our financial policy of a target single A rating a leverage level of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA and ultimately a dividend level in line with our peers. Deleveraging both GE and GE Capital is a priority and we have significant sources to achieve our goals.","As Larry mentioned, we view these businesses differently with different balance sheets and capital structure needs and therefore we analyze their leverage separately. Our goal is leverage for the GE industrial businesses of less than 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA. We plan to make significant progress toward this goal by the end of 2020 and as a reminder when we speak about net debt, we're talking about debt adjusted for pensions, operating leases and a portion of preferred stock and cash. Measured on this basis, GE Industrial net debt at the end of 2018 was $55 billion. As we look out over the next couple of years, we expect to have roughly $50 billion of industrial sources that can be used to delever and derisk the company.","These sources include $18 billion of debt and pension transfer to Healthcare and more than $30 billion of cash proceeds from the monetization of up to just under 50% of Healthcare, 100% of our remaining stake in Baker Hughes GE and our stake in transportation. These sources will be used in part to reduce GE net debt by more than $30 billion including repaying a significant part of the $14 billion of debt transferred from GE Capital and reducing commercial paper. The parent also plans to contribute $4 billion to GE Capital in 2019 to maintain adequate capital levels there.","At GE Capital, we have a plan to reduce our debt to equity ratio to less than 4x by the end of 2020. GE Capital began the quarter with $70 billion of debt and ended with $66 billion while our total assets measure $124 billion. For the year, we made significant progress at GE Capital paying down $21 billion of external debt, taking down leverage by 1.4 turns including reducing commercial paper from $5 billion to zero.","GE Capital ended 2018 with $15 billion of liquidity. Over the next two years, we expect to generate additional sources of cash from asset sales, including $10 billion in 2019 from completing our GE Capital $25 billion asset reduction plan. We'll have cash from the pay down of most of the debt transferred to GE and capital support from GE. We have reached an agreement in principle on WMC that we expect to conclude expeditiously. And in 2019 and 2020, GE Capital will pay down $25 billion of scheduled debt maturities and continue to contribute about $2 billion per year of capital to our insurance businesses as previously disclosed. We now don't expect to issue new debt until 2021.","We are planning approximately $4 billion of capital contributions to GE Capital in 2019. This includes $1.5 billion for the WMC agreement in principal announced today and ensuring we have adequate risk-based capital levels for our current portfolio. Going forward, we anticipate funding any insurance capital requirements or strategic options through a combination of GE Capital earnings, asset sales, liquidity and GE parent support. While we have more work to do, we continue to make progress in strengthening the balance sheet.","Next on Power. Orders were down 19% in the quarter. Gas Power Systems orders were down 26%. For the year, Gas Power Systems orders were down 40%. We ended the year with a $9 billion backlog, which was down 8% year-over-year. This is consistent with our outlook for a 25 to 30 gigawatt market for the foreseeable future. Power Services orders were down 20%. Steam orders were up 61% and grid orders were down 13% for the year. Power revenue was down 25%. Gas Power Systems revenues were down 21%. Power Services revenue was also down 21%. During the quarter, we took $400 million of charges related to our CSA contracts, which impacts revenue. Excluding these charges Power Services revenue was down 11%. Steam revenue was down 30% on lower America's and Europe volume and grid was flat.","Moving to profit. The segment loss $872 million in the fourth quarter. We performed our normal CSA reviews and while total utilization on the book is flat, we have seen lower utilization on some of our units in some geographies and some pricing pressure in contracts relative to ongoing market dynamics and we updated our assumptions to reflect a revised outlook in these areas.","In addition, we had our normal cost standard updates, which included updates to our cost standards including the impact of the stage-one blade issue as expected. This resulted in the $400 million of charges that I previously mentioned. In addition, we also incurred about $350 million of costs related to Gas Power Systems projects. Similar to the third quarter, we continue to experience project execution issues resulting in liquidated damages as well as partner execution issues. Grid profit was down year-over-year impacted negatively by the buyout of the Alstom share of the JV.","These items had a significant impact on Power's results and overall, we see the heavy duty gas turbine market is flat over the next few years and see significant opportunity to improve our own execution. Next on Aviation, which had another great quarter. Orders of $8.8 billion were up 12%. Equipment orders grew 20%, driven by continued strong momentum of the LEAP engine program up 56% versus prior year. Military engine orders were up 69% driven by the F414 and service orders grew 7%. Revenues of $8.5 billion grew 21%. Equipment revenues were up 13% on higher commercial engine partially offset by lower military volume.","Specifically, we shipped 379 LEAP engines this quarter up 177 units year-over-year. And in total, we shipped 1,118 LEAP engines for the year. We're still behind on deliveries by about four weeks but the business expects to be back on schedule by mid-2019. Services revenue grew 26% with spares rate up 10% driven by higher fleet utilization and spare parts consumption from strong air traffic. Segment profit of $1.7 billion was up 24% on higher volumes, improved price and operating productivity and compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we shipped almost 90% more LEAP engines.","Despite the negative mix from higher LEAP shipments operating profit margins of 20.4% expanded 60 basis points in the quarter and 130 basis points for the year. The LEAP engine continues to perform very well with a 58% win rate on the A320neo family and 81% win rate in the narrow-body segment when you add in Boeing 737 MAX and Comac C919. Utilization rates are over 95%. We continue to improve the cost position of the LEAP and over the last two years, we've taken out more than 40% of the cost of the engine and are ahead on the learning curve initially laid out for the program. The overall program will break even around 2021.","Now, I'll provide some additional transparency on the engine transition in the narrow-body market. The mixing from CFM56 to LEAP resulted in a margin drag of approximately 160 basis points in 2018 and 130 basis points in the quarter. The business is successfully offsetting this margin pressure through continued growth in aftermarket services, military and changing the mix of company-funded R&D spend. In summary, another strong year for David and the aviation team. In renewables, renewables orders were up 19% versus prior year driven by onshore equipment up 9% and services up 32% on strong repower units.","We shipped 44% more megawatts and onshore wind and saw strong orders bookings 3 gigawatts in the fourth quarter and 8.6 gigawatts for the year and we gained share. Revenues of $3.4 billion were up 28% mainly driven by onshore wind up 34% on both higher new unit shipments and repowering volume. Segment margin of 2% was down 330 basis points for the quarter and profit of $67 million was down 51% mainly driven by negative price, liquidated damages for execution delays on a handful of complicated projects including some legacy Alstom projects and higher losses in hydro and offshore as we began fully consolidating these entities in the fourth quarter.","The consolidation presented a headwind of about 220 basis points. Recall that we had to book loss reserves at the time of the Alstom deal and we continue to burn through the negative cash flow impact of those projects. The business has seen favorable cash tailwinds from the PTC cycle, pricing is improving and we continue to see strong product cost reduction and while we're seeing some adverse impacts from tariffs, we're working to mitigate them with pricing and supply chain actions.","For Healthcare, orders of $5.8 billion were up 2% organically. On a product line basis, Life Sciences orders were up 13% organically with bioprocess up 20%. Healthcare Systems orders were down 1% organically, which was about what we expected as we were comping a very strong fourth quarter in 2017.","Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 6% organically. Healthcare Systems revenue grew 4% organically and Life Sciences was up 10%. Segment margin was 21.8% expanding 10 basis points reported and 110 basis points organically, which excluded costs incurred in preparation for a separation in 2019. Profit was $1.2 billion up 2% on a reported basis and 12% organically. Organic profit growth was driven by volume and cost productivity partially offset by inflation, price and higher program investment. As the Healthcare team continues to prepare for separation, they closed out a solid year.","Moving to oil and gas. Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning and Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today following ours. Next for Transportation and Lighting. Since we last spoke in October, we signed an agreement to sell Current to American Industrial Partners and the Justice Department has closed its review of the pending merger between GE Transportation and Wabtec.","Last week, we also announced amended transaction terms to further support our deleveraging plan. GE will increase its stake in Wabtec from approximately 10% to approximately 25% resulting in increased cash proceeds of approximately $2.2 billion as we sell down our stake. We will still receive $2.9 billion in cash from Wabtec at closing and both transactions are expected to close in early 2019 subject to customary closing conditions.","Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. Net loss from continuing operations was $86 million in the quarter, including a tax reform adjustment of negative $128 million. Adjusted continuing net income was $43 million. We completed our annual GAAP loss recognition testing in our runoff insurance portfolio, which resulted in an after-tax charge of about $65 million to increase reserves.","As part of the test, we unlocked our future policy benefit reserve and updated key assumptions related to the book. The two largest drivers being the changes to our assumptions and morbidity improvement of a negative $1.2 billion offset by discount rate impact of $1.9 billion. Recall that statutory testing not GAAP drives funding. We expect to conclude the statutory testing in mid-to-late February and consistent with our existing insurance funding plan, we continue to expect required statutory funding of approximately $2 billion in the first quarter of 2019. We are managing this runoff portfolio with new management and increased board expertise and focus.","To provide additional information to further clarify our insurance obligations, we plan to include enhanced disclosures related to our insurance book in our 10-K, which will be released in mid-to-late February. We'll include a wide range of items from the profile of our book to morbidity and mortality assumptions to lapse rates, premium increases and related sensitivities.","With that I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Jamie, thank you. So hopefully, by now you have a better sense of what I'm seeing at GE after nearly four months, our strengths, our challenges and our strategy for moving forward. I'd like to give you all the information and views on 2019 that we have today with more to come soon. We expect industrial organic revenue growth to be up low to mid-single digits on the back of a significant ramp in renewables and continued strength in Aviation and Healthcare.","Power will be down in a flat to slightly down market in 2019. We also expect our industrial operating margins to expand. On free cash flow, we expect to face operating headwinds such as the PTC progress cycle reversing in renewables and we will spend more cash on restructuring at both Corporate and Power. In addition, we have a number of nonrecurring investments and commitments that create a drag on our free cash flow in 2019 but which will meaningfully lessen in 2020 and '21. These include transitioning to GE Capital supply chain financing program to MUFG and reducing factoring with GE Capital, Alstom pension contributions and legal settlements and the costs related to the preparation for our Healthcare business for our public separation.","We anticipate cash flow to grow substantially in 2020 and 2021 as we make significant headway in addressing legacy and structural issues while simultaneously realizing the benefits from restructuring and stronger daily management of our businesses particularly in Power. In aviation, we see 75% to 80% of the 2019 commercial engine revenues secured in the backlog, with a largely recurring service revenue stream of approximately $15 billion. We are maintaining margin levels consistent with pre-LEAP periods despite mix changes with a healthy new order book. With these in mind, we see high single-digit revenue growth and low single-digit profit growth.","In Healthcare, we expect organic growth in margins in a similar range to last year. We see double-digit revenue growth in renewables. The business is coming through the PTC cycle and onshore wind, which contributed to strong cash performance in 2018, as a result of progress build. That progress cycle will begin reversing this year, as we transition to factory production and book revenue against those contracts. However, we see price declines moderating and within the level of our product cost reduction efforts going forward. This is our baseline today for 2019 as our plan continues to evolve. As we develop more conviction around the cash flow situation of Power, we will update you in the near term with respect to the outlook for the full year.","So my message for 2019 is that the more stable businesses of Aviation and Healthcare are healthy and growing. Renewables is moving through the PTC cycle. We are working on Power and capital is shrinking. 2019 is still very much a work in progress but the company is becoming stronger. As I said earlier, the how much is important here, but the how is far more fundamental. How is about understanding and fixing problems at root cause. How is about process not for processes sake but to ensure the sustainability of our results to create enduring shareholder value. I'm proud of the momentum, I see across this company and the changes we're making to strengthen GE for the long run.","With that we'll open it up to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And from Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe.","Nigel Coe","Thanks. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Morning. Lots of questions. I mean, I'm sure a lot of my questions will be picked up by other analysts, but I just want to start on. It sounds like your plans on Healthcare now are pretty defined, Larry. It looks like you're looking to monetize 50% putting an $18 billion of pension debts, via an IPO-type process. Is that now defined or are there still some moving pieces on that process?","Larry Culp","Well, I think we've talked about that separation as the plan of record and that continues to be the case today. The team is very well along Nigel with respect to the preparation for a flotation. We don't have a time frame per se to share with you today but we are spending a significant amount of money in '19 as we did last year in preparation. We're obviously proud of what Karyn and the team are doing here. Very strong top line earnings and cash performance and we think this is a business that is going to be a strong resilient performer through cycles. So that is the plan.","Nigel Coe","Okay. And then my follow-on would be, you gave a lot of detail on what you've been doing for the last few months and lots of opportunities for improvement. One thing, you didn't really touch on was pricing and pricing excellence and your one precedent of GE in the past has been may be trading price for market share. So I'm just curious, what your thoughts are in terms of improving the pricing realization going forward?","Larry Culp","Nigel, forgive us, if we didn't get into that in detail. We didn't want to overstay our welcome with respect to our prepared remarks. But when you hear us refer to profitable market share that is both an external and internal recognition. And it can't be share for share sake. And particularly in Power, I think we are acutely aware that we have opportunities both on new equipment and on the service book to basically value sell what we're doing more frequently. I got the word last night for example within Power of a project that is looking very good where we're frankly -- we are not the low bid, right? I think that just speaks to the way we're able to communicate the value of our technology. We know in these businesses from Healthcare to renewables price is a reality. We want to be smarter around pricing, at the same time, frankly when you hear us talk about labor and material productivity, we really want to push that hard and do that in line with market realities, so that we can maintain margins in light of some of those pressures.","Jamie Miller","And Nigel, just to add a little bit more color there on the numbers. Orders pricing in total for the year was relatively flat. It was actually up just slightly and it was up more than that in the second half. And as Larry mentioned, we are seeing in the numbers the pressure moderating at Power and at renewables. Power really with respect to the enhanced discipline on new projects and bids as Larry talked about. In renewables, we're seeing that pressure moderate as we move throughout the year as well primarily as we're moving through that PTC cycle. The supply chains are more stretched and that price dynamic becomes a little bit more unbalanced. Aviation and Healthcare are running as you would expect, which is strongly as Larry mentioned.","Operator","And from JPMorgan, we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, good morning. So you mentioned on the free cash flow dynamics, you mentioned the PTC headwind, a bit more restructuring cash, some other I guess nonrecurring investments. Can you maybe give us some color on that? In addition, just provide some color on how much of a, I think Jamie said before about $1 billion of headwind or so from divestitures. So maybe just help us with a bit of a rough bridge from the $4.5 you did in 2018? Because obviously that sounds like it's going to be down.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So why don't I talk through the components of 2018 first in terms of really walking you through the rounding out our fourth quarter performance and we can address some of those questions. So for 2018, if you really walk the changes, we obviously had earnings. We also had working capital, which for the year was basically zero impact of free cash flow. Fourth quarter was $2.3 billion positive. As we expected with large volumes coming through this quarter. Contract assets was basically flat.","Steve Tusa","Hey, sorry. I can see the slide. I just wanted to know like $4.5 billion. Is that -- there's a lot of headwinds that Larry had talked about. I'm just curious as to maybe you can give us some color on the size of some of those headwinds? And obviously, it sounds like it will be down. Will you as an organization generate cash including GE Capital next year? I guess that's the simple way to ask the question.","Larry Culp","Yeah, Steve. And I think the simple answer the question is, what we're trying to communicate today is that we are going to see pressures both operational and nonrecurring. We are going to be back shortly when we can take you through a detailed walk in that regard. I think from an operating perspective, is worth acknowledging a lot of good performance in the number of businesses.","Clearly renewables was stronger from a cash perspective in '18 and is likely to be in '19 given the PTC dynamic. And we are going to go deep here on additional restructuring where we see opportunities to put that money to work and generate real returns. We also have some of these nonrecurring events or issues. Some of them are policy decisions like the move on the supply chain financing program. I think we've got better line of sight today on some of these legacy issues that come out of Alstom that we're on the hook or those are real cash commitments in '19 that abate thereafter and we do have the cost relative in Healthcare IPO.","So again, I think the headline is, we finished strongly. We know we got some operating and non-operating pressures and think we work through that in '19 with an eye toward a stronger cash flow performance in '20 and '21 with more details to come soon.","Steve Tusa","Great. And what do you expect GE cash to earn in 2019 and how much from an ongoing cash generation perspective, how much will they be generating?","Larry Culp","Steve, as I said in both my prepared remarks and a moment ago when we have everything locked down to get into those specifics then we'll do that soon. We'll be back to you.","Operator","From Vertical Research we have Jeffrey Sprague","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jamie Miller","Morning, Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yeah. Two from me. Just thinking about the Healthcare exit in particular. Kind of, for lack of a better term, losing that cash flow near term seems like it would create some stress on the organization. Can you give us a sense of, what you foresee as kind of the timing of the exit? And then Larry, particularly interested also on, how you view exiting the remaining 50% stake. Do you see the potential for some kind of, equity-friendly exit with that piece the split-off for example, which you might shrink the share count of the remaining company?","Larry Culp","Well Steve, I'd like to think that everything that we do is shareholder-friendly, right? I mean, we take a strong view here and you know, from seeing me in other roles that we want to create long-term shareholder value with the cumulative effect of everything that we do. I think with respect to Healthcare what we can confirm today is that we're on the path toward an IPO here in 2019. Timing is still TBD. So we don't have a date. Like me on my senior prom. I just don't have a date for you today but I think in time, we'll have more clarity.","With respect to Baker Hughes, I mean we talked about that as part of that $50 billion pool of options to go to. I think that the high probability there is for us is to sell our shares. We certainly are approached by various folks, who have an interest in a stake in that company. And again, we don't have a timetable per se to share with you today but we want to reiterate our view to dispose of that stake in an orderly manner, which again we think is conducive to value creation for our shareholders.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks. And just as a follow-up. I didn't have a prom date and I've been called worse than Steve but as unrelated follow-up, if we think about what you're going through in insurance right now, the comment about the statutory review. Is that to indicate Larry or Jamie that even if there is some adverse outcome as it relates to that statutory review, it would not affect your near-term funding needs and instead those would be tacked onto the tail, so to speak of what you're planning from reserve build?","Jamie Miller","Well, Jeff what I was referring to there was that, it's really the statutory calculation not the GAAP that drives the statutory funding needs. We are right in the middle of that process. We continue to expect to contribute about $2 billion to the insurance entities in 2019. We'll conclude that process over the next three to four weeks. But at this point that is what we expect.","Larry Culp","Sorry about that Jeff.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks.","Operator","From Barclays, we have Julian Mitchell.","Julian Mitchell","Morning. Maybe as the first question on Power. I understand, you're reticent to give too much forward-looking color but perhaps give us a sense of, if you look at the reported 2018 numbers EBIT loss of $800 million free cash of minus $2.7 billion. How would you look at the or characterize to us the underlying figures for both of those two items, if you strip out charges and projects execution overruns and so on? And maybe also on that point, if you could give any color as to the separation of gas and non-gas within Power? What sort of financial conditions that separation has uncovered in each of the two pieces?","Larry Culp","Sure, sure. Let me do that and again this is very much a work in progress with a new team establishing new operating rhythms. But I would say that if we start on the service side of things, right? We've got a $62 billion backlog. We did take the charge in the fourth quarter $400 million on about a $3.7 billion contract asset book and we think that's appropriate just given what we see in the marketplace. I think we're encouraged though relative to the execution around pricing here. We have changed the way the folks in the field are compensated.","Transitioning them, if you will from volume to margin. But again, there's a good bit of productivity post Alstom that we still need to get from the combined organizations here and that work is incomplete. But that's part of that operating loss that you see here at year's end. We are clearly dealing with lower demand in equipment, encouraged by some of the share points in the US market here in the back half. But again, we want to make sure we focused on profitable share. There we took $350 million of charges around the project book and we know that we have a lot of execution here to improve just in the way these projects are brought online.","I think when you look at the vintages, we're encouraged by the progress that we see post the '16 underwriting class in terms of our margins on those projects. But that's very much a work in progress. I think with respect to the change in the structure of Power, again part of it is a cost reduction. We shared some of that in the prepared remarks but we also are getting better visibility on the underlying businesses P&L-by-P&L. So we talk about gas, we're combining services and equipment then we have the rest of our Power portfolio.","As Jamie mentioned, we now take on all the cost for grid now that we own all of it that doesn't help us at all. But now we've got better line of sight on the discreet P&L's grid, Steam, Power Conversion and Nuclear all four of those businesses have meaningful profit improvement potential and we're going to manage them from the bottoms up accordingly. So clearly, we're at a break even from our P&L perspective absence some other charges, a lot of work to do here and as we have better visibility and more conviction around those improvements, we'll be back and we'll be back here soon with respect to how that plays out in '19 and '20.","Jamie Miller","The other color I would just add there on negative free cash flow is as volume comes down in the factories and as our projects continue to work their way through, you see volume leveling but we've been in a declining frame here. So what's really flowing through on cash in addition to some of the other items Larry mentioned is a burn down of our progress billings and a burn down of our project payables. Situations where we receive projects in advance of constructing new equipment or where we received progress on projects and now we're in the phase of the project, where the payables and the costs are starting to come through. So that's also pressuring the Power of free cash flow. And as that levels that also starts to level.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. And then my second question may be about a business, where there's better medium term visibility Aviation. You talked about the LEAP operating margin headwind last year. How do you see that moving in 2019 relative to that 160 bps? And then looking out beyond just this year anything on the horizon in terms of let's say 777X transition or NMA that you think could cause a major risk to the aviation free cash flow in margin profile?","Jamie Miller","With respect to Aviation's merger and mix you saw strong fourth quarter and when we look at the remixing that's happening between CFM and LEAP significant increase in LEAP shipments in the quarter up 88% over the prior year. Year-over-year 2.4x up and you're seeing CFM come down meaningfully over those same periods. Next year, CFM will come down again about I'd say more than 50% of CFM deliveries will be reduced next year but the LEAP also ramps from the 1,118 we had this year up to 1,800-plus. So that remixing continues to occur. We mentioned on the call that it was a drag in 2018 of 160 basis points. We do expect continued some small drag next year but again Aviation's doing a really nice job offsetting that with services growth. They're shifting in military and the company-funded R&D.","Larry Culp","We're clearly in conversations with our major airframe customers about new platforms. I think at this point, it would be premature to suggest that we're going to have a cash flow headwind a material cash flow headwind around any of those programs here in '19.","Operator","From Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","And Larry I don't buy that you're going to have a prom date. That's nonsense. Even I had a prom date. I was bald at birth. All kidding aside, the one number you gave that was new, which was kind of eye-popping to me, it was just $1.6 billion Power headquarter number. Can you put some context around that? It seems just like such a insane number. But I don't know really what you're including in that I guess as far as talking about headquarter?","Larry Culp","Well, there's -- it's a large number and again, I think we've got line of sight here in the near terms Scott to bring that down by about 300. And effectively, as you know, we've done a lot horizontally both at corporate and at the segment levels over time for the businesses. So it's not as if it's unhelpful or wasteful but there clearly is an adjustment we can take here as we move those activities into the businesses and I think over time as the businesses have true ownership for them that they are in their operating budgets as opposed to an allocation from corporate. They're likely to find opportunities for further savings. But we don't do it primarily for the cost reduction. I think we really do it to help drive visibility and accountability P&L-by-P&L. I think I've shared with some folks that early on in my tenure we would talk about Power as if it was one business. It's obviously a number of businesses. Some better than others, different issues here and there. I think we've got better visibility on those issues. It's not perfect today but as we get that visibility I think better position to take meaningful action to drive better results across that portfolio.","Scott Davis","That make sense. And then the other thing is just not totally clear is, if the New World is 25 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts, which arguably a lot of people can say the New World is 25 or even a little lower but how do you get your capacity down anywhere close to that? I mean you've got big factories, lots of capital equipment, lot of pressure from governments and unions and everybody else. Is it realistic to be able to get that down in the next two years? it's something that's closer to 30?","Larry Culp","Well, I think it is realistic, right? There are going to be a number of competing priorities and pressures but we took $1 billion of cost out last year. I think we are putting the -- we're putting up the parameters of a program to build on what we did last year. So Scott, we have to do this. We absolutely have to do this. I think we know, it's a multiyear effort but the challenge here around margins is not simply one of capacity. Right back to the earlier question around pricing. Productivity both in new equipment and in the field on services. It's a whole host of things that I think give us the optimism that we can drive better margin and cash performance in this business. But we have to prove that to you.","Operator","And from Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey. Good morning, guys. Larry, one of the biggest issues I think that investors have had when GE is the concern that legacy liabilities will continue to surprise the company. The FIRREA agreement with the DOJ seems like a positive development in that regard, so does is the relatively small LTC adjustment. But at this point, do you feel reasonably confident that you've identified all the skeletons in the closet in a level of negative surprises are really going to start dropping moving forward?","Larry Culp","I don't think I would ever say, even on my last day here that we have found all the skeletons, right? I don't tend to take absolute positions. But that said I think you're spot on. The news today around WMC is good both with respect to a resolution and the fact that we came in right where we were reserved. So we can begin to move that episode behind us. I think we're encouraged by the results that Jamie walked you through relative to the LRT.","But again, the cash requirements really come from the stat and not the GAAP test and that will still has a few more weeks to run. But in the absence of no new news again with a lot of fresh eyes and it's not my fresh eyes we've got a new GC, we've got a new controller new to GE in their first years. I think that is a positive sign that we aren't adding to the list. We're going to be as open and transparent as we possibly can, when we find things. And we're going to help you understand what we're doing to address them but I'm encouraged by what I see and what has not arisen here in nearly four months time.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And Larry, you're pretty clear about having no plans to sell GECAS. It sounds quite definitive but obviously there's a lot of noise out there. So maybe I could step back and ask you how you weigh the urgency to get GE Capital debt down versus keeping the strong earnings stream in tact from GECAS that you have in the business?","Larry Culp","Well, I think that we're -- we're frankly keen not to comment on every rumor on every innuendo that's out there. GECAS is one business that we get inbounds on with some frequency. But frankly. We get inbounds on everything but my desk. I think it speaks to the quality of the assets. Again, I think we can delever and bring that net debt down from $55 billion to something closer to $25 billion. We've got a number of options. We are mindful of the trades when we move assets out and the impact on our earnings and cash capability. But again, you elevate to the strategic level, I think we are clear. We need to delever and we're going to work the plan that we've outlined here today and that's really is I think as simple and as straightforward as it gets.","Operator","From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Hi, good morning. Just a question. You mentioned that you took $400 million of contract asset writedown in Power. And my understanding is that sort of culturally is a big deal. Shall we see more of these writedowns? How far along are we in the process of evaluating the book there?","Jamie Miller","We asked our new controller, when he started to take a clean look at everything across the company. And they -- as they went through their normal standards CSA reviewed this quarter did pay particular attention to higher risk contracts, just to make sure that we were thinking about them cleanly and the right way. What we talked about on the call, which was really comprised of three different buckets were the results of that review.","So as we mentioned before, we had adjustments for utilization, some on pricing pressure and then just our standard cost updates. On the utilization side, when you look at the CSA book, utilization has been relatively flat and it's demonstrating actually a fairly healthy profile. And I think it just continues to support the base that gas continues to be an important source of energy generation. Now some geographies are impacted more by some of the renewables adoptions. And as you look at our book, our concentration of geographies isn't largely in those areas but we did see some true-ups that we took in places like California and Turkey just to make sure we were reflecting our best view on that.","On the pricing pressure, we are seeing that in some contracts. These are high margin long term contracts. And when we do go through renegotiation process on some of these, we are often able to offset that pricing with scope expansion and cost productivity. Having said that we wanted to make sure we had a realistic view of how we saw the portfolio, when we went through these reviews. We always do standard cost updating in our portfolio, that's just like you do in manufacturing. Those standard cost roll through this quarter as well. And part of that also reflected a small impact from the stage one blade issue but that's something that we had expected would happen, there as well.","Andrew Obin","Got you. And just on GE Capital. How much incremental capital? You said $4 billion in '19 but how much incremental, do you need to put in 2020 to achieve your leverage targets? Thank you.","Jamie Miller","Yeah. So Andrew at this point, we're talking about 2019, which is the $4 billion. And as we said as we get beyond 2019, we obviously understand. We will continue to put capital or expect to continue to put capital into the insurance subsidiaries. That will be funded through a combination of GE Capital earnings asset sales liquidity and GE parents support but at this point, we're not prepared to talk more fully about that.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","So, good morning. So I just want to start on Power kind of a two part question. You reduced headcount by 15%, you reduced footprint by 30%. I know that pricing is an important part of the equation of getting back to profitability here but I guess maybe what inning are you in with respect to what you need to do to get to the right level of capacity utilization? And then same topic different question. What exactly are you doing to improve Power execution since that keeps coming up as a driver of weaker profitability and when might we stop talking about that piece of the margin headwinds?","Larry Culp","Well, Nicole I would say, we are in the very early innings relative to the turnaround at Power. I don't know, how else to frame it. Again, a new team, a new structure, new operating rhythms. When we talk about execution, we talk about daily management. What I'm really referring to is making sure that every day the folks in the field, the folks in the factories, the folks in the labs understand what the key operating metrics are that they are responsible for that feed into better margins both at the growth in the operating level in this business. So that takes time because it's not just a reporting exercise, right? It's a management exercise and making sure they not understand not only how they're being measured but how to go about actually getting better price, how to go about actually driving better material productivity. Execution in the field as well. Not only around cost but frankly more importantly around quality making sure we get into outages quickly and we solve issues for customers the first time and when we're not going back. Those are the source of things. And it is a big organization. It's a global organization. This is going to take a little while. But I'm optimistic that we'll see it in our operating metrics over time and that will in turn translate into better performance. We'll clearly get some lift sooner from the absence of the adjustments that we made at the end of the year but what I'm really focused on and what I think investors are to be focused on, are those underlying operating improvements.","Nicole DeBlase","Okay, got it. That's helpful. Thanks, Larry. And just a really quick one to tie up. Good progress on corporate expense reduction this quarter. Would you say that the corporate expense that we saw in 4Q is indicative of the run rate for 2019? Or are there items there that we need to consider?","Jamie Miller","I'd say it's roughly indicative. I think it'll be down slightly from that. It was a little bit higher in the quarter due to some onetime expenses we had but it's close. Little bit down from that in 2019.","Operator","From RBC Capital Markets, we have Deane Dray. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Larry Culp","Hey, Dean. Good morning.","Deane Dray","I'd also like to add our welcome to Steve Winoker and wish him all the best.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Dean.","Deane Dray","Looks like I have to burn one of my questions, what's more of a housekeeping question Larry is in the third quarter earnings you talked about plans for an Analyst meeting in early 2019. Looks like, there's still a lot of more specifics that have to get filled in in terms of guidance and especially on the cash flow side. Maybe you're not ready yet to host that meeting. But just where does that stand and what would the timing be?","Larry Culp","Well, Dean again, I think we're sharing today what we can in terms of not only the fourth quarter but the actions that are under way and how we see 2019 shaping up. We know we're not answering every question that folks might have on their minds today. But we're not going to answer any question without a grounding and a level of conviction that we expect of ourselves and I think folks like yourselves and investors expect of us as well but we are indicating that we'll be back soon with more particularly as we work through some of the issues, we've talked about not only in our prepared remarks but also here in Q&A with respect to Power.","Deane Dray","Okay. And Larry, I appreciate how you started off the call with all the changes in terms of the management approach and the accountability and voice of the customer. I mean that's --that was all good color to hear upfront. And then my second question is on the insurance side. We've got good news, what I see is good news on the loss recognition certainly not a new surprise. How does that change? In the third quarter, there was lots of calls for how to ring fence the long term insurance risk and where that might be. Where does that stand today in terms of priorities?","Larry Culp","Well, Dean, again I want to make sure everybody understands that the LRT results here are a positive data point. I think that the stat test is going to be more important and I think we don't expect any major surprises but we'll have those results to share with you in a few weeks. This is a long term liability right? And we have our commitments with respect to the permitted practice. We're in a position to fulfill those. We certainly get inbounds here as well from folks, who'd like to take this book off of our hands. But not necessarily in a structure and at a value that would make sense for the GE shareholder. So I suspect that as we enhance our disclosures, they'll be better understanding of what this is.","Certainly I suspect there will still be some debate. But I'm optimistic that the transparency will lead to better understanding and we can talk about this in a fact-based way. People can understand what that means. Is it with us forever? Or is there a way to ring fence it is to use your word again, I'm not going to rule anything out. But I think right now, what we're trying to do is to make sure that everyone understands, what it is and what our obligations are around the insurance book. So hopefully, some helpful disclosures in that regard today with more to come in the K once we're on the other side of the stat test.","Operator","And from Gordon Haskett, we have John Inch. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Larry.","Larry Culp","Hey, John. Good morning.","John Inch","Hi, Steve.","Steve Winoker","Good morning, John.","John Inch","Good morning, Steve. Just on the capital guide. I may have missed this Jamie and Larry but what is capital guide for 2019? What are you expecting? And what kind of, are we expecting from say gains from the $10 billion of asset sales? So it's almost like, what's the guide ex the $10 billion on earnings? And also Jamie, what was Healthcare's free cash flow in 2018?","Jamie Miller","Well, with respect to GE Capital's 2019 as Larry mentioned, we're not offering 2019 guidance today. So that's something that we will be sharing with you in the near term but not today. And with respect to Healthcare's free cash flow, I think it's well understood that that is a strong cash flow business. It's a flow business unlike some of our long cycle and I think there's been a lot of valuation maps that's been out there. So while we're not disclosing Healthcare's free cash flow, I think you can probably come to a pretty reasonable conclusion there about what that is.","John Inch","Okay. I think we were targeting break even in capital this year and we ended up losing money. I'm just wondering, what is -- what actually changed in the mix from Jamie, when you originally thought would be break even to the loss? And also in your cash walk on the fourth quarter cash walk, the Baker Hughes free cash flow is a positive $800 million. It looks like Baker actually generated positive free cash flow in the fourth quarter. So why would that be a positive? Why isn't that a negative drawing it out, it's just a technical question, I guess.","Jamie Miller","Well, first on GE Capital. We had the LRT results in the fourth quarter so that was $65 million. We actually had tax benefits of less than we expected as well. That impacted us by about $240 million. And then we had some other marks in the portfolio in the second half. So that was really the large difference between what we had expected and where we ended up. And then with respect to Baker Hughes. We are backing out free cash flow. So that might be a labeling issue on the slide there. It's less Baker Hughes free cash flow. If you back it out and you have the dividend.","Operator","And from Goldman Sachs, we have Joe Ritchie. Please go ahead.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Hey, Joe. Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Good morning, guys. And so just I know, you're a little reluctant to answer much on the 2019 guide. But I could just may be ask on just Power free cash flow, the $2.7 billion burn this year. Do you expect '19 to be better than 2018 from a Power free cash flow perspective?","Larry Culp","I think we're at a place, where we're sharing with you today everything that we know, everything we can commit to. And again, we'll be back with more detail particularly with respect to Power and cash soon. But we're just, we're not in a position where we're able to do that. But clearly, again, hopefully the color around the $2.7 billion that we burned last year is helpful. With respect to framing the magnitude of the task and the challenge, when we understand and are serious about addressing.","Joe Ritchie","Getting the disclosure on the $2.7 billion definitely helpful and will hopefully get some more color on the path in the near term. But I guess, if I can maybe focus then on just the onetime issues that occurred in the second half of 2018. Specifically, around the blade issue. Is it fair to say that those issues are at least behind you? And how should we think about what the call it roughly, it sounds like it was like roughly $700 million or so in quantifiable charges there. What does that relate to? Does that relate to all orders that you received so far in each turbine. Just any color on that would be helpful?","Larry Culp","Yes. Well the -- when we talk about the cost for the blade issue, it's really a function of going out and effectively replacing these blades sooner than we were anticipating, right? Because the useful life is effectively shorter than we had anticipated unfortunately. But we think we understand that. That work is under way with respect to the installed base. And again, I think it's regrettable. I think our customers when you talk to them understand, what's happened how we're going about remediating the issue in the field and I'd like to think that that is not something, we're going to continue to site with respect to the margin pressure in the business here in '19.","Jamie Miller","Yeah. And just walking back from third quarter and maybe updating today. So third quarter, we had $240 million of warranty and other accruals related to the stage one blade. We also mentioned that that we expected to experience a similar amount of that over time as the worked outperformed in our services book. So part of what I mentioned earlier on those charges includes that stage one blade issue started to come through the services updates.","Larry Culp","But there are host of elements of that","Jamie Miller","Absolutely.","Larry Culp","That update not just the very.","Jamie Miller","Yeah. It's a very small issue in the quarter. But it's just part of that that bleed off as we do the work.","Larry Culp","Thanks, Joe.","And our final question from Cowen and Company, we have Gautam Khanna. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes. Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Larry Culp","Good morning.","Gautam Khanna","Two questions. First, I was wondering, if you have any changes being contemplated to the incentive comp triggers for senior management as we approach the whole proxy time frame? Any changes to the PSU triggers that you're thinking about now?","Larry Culp","Nothing that we can reference this morning.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And I was wondering, if you could talk about when you expect pricing to bottom and the transactional Power aftermarket? Or if it has already in your opinion? And how will that pricing now compares to maybe where it was a year ago?","Jamie Miller","I think that's a question that depends on geography and it depends on the scope and the kinds of work, we're really looking to do with our customers. Over the last year, as we've talked about before as Scott has come in. He has really refocused our transactional group, to focus more on in some cases less scope but higher margin work as we do it. You know, it's a competitive market but even having said that that as we have our orders come in, we're seeing order CM or margin rate up in some cases 10, 12, 15 points on our order book and it's been consistently increasing throughout the year.","Now as Larry mentioned earlier on the call, we're not yet seeing all of that drop through primarily because of field execution issues and operational issues. But these are things that we believe are fixable. And over time as we really seek to increase our share in that book, it really capture the kind of work that we want to capture the higher margin work, the operational execution piece of that we think should flow through. But with the respect to the margin pressure generally, I should say pricing pressure, these are very competitive markets that have a lot of capacity. So I think that dynamic will continue as we go through the next couple of years and until the market levels out and until we see the capacity leveling out as well.","Steve Winoker","I know, we ran out of time before we could get to everyone in the queue. So you can reach me and my team through the day. But I want to thank everybody for joining us. The replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"9826":["General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q4 2016 Results Earnings Conference Call January 20, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Matt Cribbins - VP Investor Communications","Jeff Immelt - Chairman and CEO","Jeff Bornstein - SVP and CFO","Analysts","Scott Davis - Barclays","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Steven Winoker - Bernstein","Steve Tusa - JP Morgan","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - UBS","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Hello everyone and welcome GE\u2019s fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. Presenting first today is our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt followed by our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our earnings release, presentation, and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our Investor website at www.ge.com\/investor. Also some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","And now, I would like to turn the call over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Matt. GE executed well in a slow growth and volatile environment. We see optimism in the United States, and here orders grew by 23%. In addition, Europe is strengthening and we see positive momentum. Meanwhile the resource sector and related markets continue to have headwind.","As you know, we closed Alstom on November 1 of 2015. As a result, the fourth quarter of 2016 was the first quarter where Alstom was organic. So, I\u2019ll give a few ways to look at the quarter. On a reported basis, orders were up 4% and revenue was flat. On an organic basis, in other words including Alstom in November and December in the organic calculation, orders were up 2% and revenue was up 4%. We also show the calculation that excludes Alstom results from the organic calculation, and segment operating profit grew by 6% in the quarter. For the quarter, we had some pluses and minuses. Orders were strong ahead of our expectations. Service growth was very strong for both, revenue and orders. Alstom synergies are ahead of plan. Some businesses had very strong years, aviation, healthcare and renewable. On the negative side, we failed to close a couple of big power deals in tough markets. And in addition, restructuring exceeded gains for the year. We are active in the portfolio in the fourth quarter. We announced the acquisition of LM renewables, strengthening our wind supply chain. We further simplified GE, announcing the disposition of our water and industrial solutions businesses.","The GE capital team has done a great job. We closed $86 billion of asset sales in 2016 and the move to become an industrial finance company is very positive for GE. I am particularly excited about the Baker Hughes merger which creates a strong full stream competitor in the industry. This is a good move for investors and customers. For the quarter, industrial and verticals earnings per share was $0.46, up 6% and for the year, EPS was a $1.49, up 14%. Industrial EPS was up 12% for the year. We accomplished much of what we said out to do in 2016, and we have no change for our framework in 2017.","To recap the year, we finished in line with what we saw in December and within the range for the year. Overall, earnings per share was a $1.49, in line with consensus; organic growth was 1% for the year; and margins of 14% were at the low end of our range. Corporate and Alstom were in line with expectations; foreign exchange created $0.03 per share of headwind for the year; and we launched incremental restructuring which again failed to fully offset, and this created $0.02 of headwind for the year. We met or exceeded most of our cash targets; at $32.6 billion, free cash flow plus dispositions were in line with our December outlook.","We had good cash to execution across both industrial and capital, and we returned more than $30 billion to investors in buyback and dividends. We\u2019ll go through each of those in more detail. In all, we\u2019re able to offset a challenging oil and gas market to deliver year in line with expectations.","Orders grew by 2% organically in the quarter; services were particularly strong with growth of 20%; and we ended the quarter with backlog of $321 billion, up $6 billion from 2015. We saw solid growth in aviation, renewables, healthcare, and oil and gas. Renewable orders grew by 32%; healthcare had great international strength with China up 20%, Europe up 6% and Latin America up 16%; GE to GE orders were up 67%.","Now, overall, equipment orders declined with tough comps and transportation versus last year. Oil and gas orders grew by 2% organically, our first growth in two years. We see some firming in the market; this includes 42% orders growth in Turbomachinery. Oil and gas equipment grew by 10% with services down slightly. And for the year, oil and gas digital orders grew by 30%. Service orders were strong across the Company, power was up 19% and transportation was up 101%. Renewables capitalized on multiple repowering opportunities to drive growth. Aviation service grew by 8% with spares up 14%, and we closed our first big lighting as a service deal with Walmart.","Orders in the U.S. grew by 23% and were down about 5% globally. We saw strength in the developed markets which grew by 8% and we booked some big global orders including a $1.4 billion order with the Iraq Ministry of Energy for gas turbines. We are gaining share with LEAP in the narrow-body segment. GE Capital facilitated $5 billion in industrial orders in the quarter. Orders pricing was down slightly with sustained pressure in oil and gas. In addition, renewables was impacted by U.S. pricing dynamics; this was in line with our expectations.","Predix and software orders, in other words excluding AGPs, grew by 36% in the quarter. At $4 billion, orders were up 22% for the year. Seven of the 10 segments grew by at least 10%. Let me give you some more details for instance for energy, a key market. Here, energy connections was up 26%, renewables were up 126% and power was up 213%. For the year, we signed 427 partnerships and have 22,000 developers on Predix. We created a few big global partnerships including Reliance and Maersk, and we signed a first enterprise-wide software agreement with Exelon to apply Predix across more than 2,000 power generation assets. Lastly, we acquired ServiceMax to extend our analytics across field service.","So, orders were in line with expectations and consistent with our goals for 2017. Segment organic growth was up 4% in the quarter. This was up 8% without the headwind of oil and gas. We saw a substantial strength behind the launch of new products. Power grew by 15% with 9 H turbines shipped. Aviation organic growth was up 6% with 44 LEAP engine ship, life sciences grew by 9%, and renewable grew by 26% as we shipped 1.9 gigawatts of onshore wind products. Services organic growth was up 5% and was particularly strong with aviation spares growth of 18%, and we saw a strong revenue growth in Europe, Japan, India and Middle East, China and Russia. Overall, global revenue grew by 3%.","Our gross margins were down 10 basis points in the quarter, driven by difficult mix, and this reflects NPI launches with the LEAP, H turbine and new wind products. The segment continued to drive down SG&A which was a benefit of about 30 basis points and segment operating profit were up 10 basis points, excluding Alstom and up a 110 basis points all in.","Total industrial margins for the year were 14%, at the low end of our 14% to 14.5% guide we gave you in December. Excluding oil and gas, margins were up 30 basis points. We made good progress on gross margins this year, up 40 basis points. And service continues to be strong with margins up a 170 basis points on the year.","Just a few comments on Alstom execution. For the quarter, Alstom generated $4.7 billion of orders, $500 million of segment profit, and $500 million of cash. So, we\u2019re seeing solid growth in grid, steam turbines and services, and we believe Alstom is making GE more competitive, and we have good momentum for 2017.","In the fourth quarter, we announced the exits of water and industrial solutions. We\u2019re seeing significant interest in the platforms and discussions are progressing. We expect to close water around mid-year and industrial solutions late in the year. Net proceeds will be approximately $4 billion, and we\u2019re targeting gains of about $2.5 billion. The gains will be offset with additional restructuring this year. At the outlook meeting, we talked about roughly a 100 basis-point margin improvement per year in 2017 and 2018. About half of that comes from running the cost play we\u2019ve been running and leveling off spend and big programs like the H, the LEAP and new wind turbines. We\u2019ve got programs around product and service costs that Jeff and Philippe Cochet are leading. And we\u2019ll drive synergies in Alstom and Baker Hughes and will continue to bring down our corporate cost.","The other 50 basis points comes from incremental cost out of two big buckets, digitization and integration learnings on structure that we\u2019ll be spreading across the rest of the Company. In total, we\u2019re working on list of close to $1.7 billion with a target of getting a $1 billion of cost out over two years.","We\u2019ve announced the new IT structure to run IT horizontally across the Company, and we expect to save $450 million. We also recently announced the partnership with PWC to hire 600 members of our tax team that will drive another $100 million of savings per year.","For cash, industrial CFOA was $8.2 billion in the quarter, the biggest cash quarter in our history. We had significant growth in CFOA and free cash flow versus fourth quarter of 2015, both growing by more than 30%. We saw a $3.2 billion reduction in working capital for the year. When you add back the $600 million from the 2016 payment of our long-term incentive plan and cash from restructuring, free cash flow conversion was significantly above last year. We received another $4 billion dividend from GE Capital for a total of $20 billion in the year. We reduced net P&E by more than a $1 billion versus expectations in the year as we completed the investment in major NPI launches. For the year, free cash flow and dispositions were about $33 billion above our plan and GE\u2019s balance sheet remained strong. We returned $30 billion to investors in dividend and buyback, a record, and we remain on track for our goals in 2017.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks, Jeff. I\u2019ll start with the fourth quarter summary.","Revenues were $33.1 billion, down 2% in the quarter; industrial revenues were down 3% to $30.4 billion. As you can see on the right side of the page, the industrial segment was flat on a reported basis. Organically, industrial segment revenue was down 1% excluding Alstom and up 4% including Alstom for the months of November and December for both 2015 and 2016.","Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.46, down 12%; excluding gains and restructuring which were a net $0.04 of a headwind in the quarter, EPS was up 6%. The operating EPS number of $0.43 includes other continuing GE Capital activity including headquarter run-off and other exit related items that I\u2019ll cover on the GE Capital page.","Continuing EPS of $0.39 includes the impact of non-operating payment; the net EPS of $0.39 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was immaterial in the quarter and down significantly from last year, which included the gain associated with the Synchrony exit.","As Jeff said, we generated $30 billion of CFOA in 2016, up from $16.4 billion last year, driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $11.6 billion, down 5% excluding deal taxes and pension contributions. We generated $8.2 billion of industrial CFOA in the fourth quarter which was up 34% versus last year; this was driven primarily by $5 billion of working capital with an improvement across all buckets including receivables and inventory, accounts payable and progress collections. Industrial free cash flow was up 39% and free cash flow conversion was 212% in the quarter. On a full year basis, industrial free cash flow conversion was 84% excluding deal taxes, pension and Alstom. Adjusting free cash flow conversion for gains, free cash flow conversion was 106% for the year.","The GE tax rate was a negative 2% for the quarter, driven by tax benefits associated with the non-core business exit in aviation. On a pre-tax basis, the gain on the disposition totaled $49 million, but because of the high tax basis on the aviation deal, after-tax gains were $325 million. Normalizing the tax rate by excluding the tax benefit associated with gains and restructuring, the tax rate for the quarter was 12%, right about where we expected. I want to be clear that the tax benefits associated with the disposition did not fall through in the earnings; they were spent in restructuring charges. Similar to the prior quarters, the GE capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on a pre-tax continuing loss. For the year, the GE tax rate was 9%.","On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis and down 1% organically, but they were up 4% organic will including Alstom organic. Excluding oil and gas, which continues to be challenge, organic revenue including Alstom was up 8% with strength in power, renewables, aviation and healthcare. Industrial segment op profit was up 6% and industrial op profit which includes corporate operating cost was up 2%. On the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.46, up 6% excluding gains and restructuring with industrial operating EPS up 5% on the same basis. For the year, we delivered $1.49 of EPS, which was up 14% versus 2015. Included in the $1.49 was $0.02 of uncovered restructuring that I\u2019ll go to on the next page.","So next on industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.08 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. This was $0.03 higher than we planned associated with the acceleration of Alstom and lighting restructuring costs as well as higher BD [ph] costs associated with decisions we\u2019ve made around water, Baker Hughes use and additive. In total for the quarter, restructuring charges were $1 billion on a pre-tax basis with $300 million related to the Alstom synergy investments. We also made significant investments in lighting, oil and gas, healthcare in the quarter. Gains in the quarter were $0.04, principally driven by non-strategic business exit in aviation. As I mentioned before, gains were $49 million on a pre-tax basis, but $325 million after-tax, which drove the low industrial tax rate quarter. The aviation divestiture was principally on the tax line, because of the high tax basis associated with the business. The gain was more than offset in earnings by higher restructuring.","In the fourth quarter, we incurred higher uncovered restructuring charges than we planned. And at the bottom of the page, you can see that for the year, we incurred $0.02 of uncovered restructuring. We chose to accelerate restructuring as we had good projects with attractive returns and it was the right thing to do for the Company as we head into 2017 and 2018. In 2017, we expect restructuring to be above $2.5 billion, funded by the water and industrial solutions dispositions with the heavier spend in the first half of the year. For the first quarter, we\u2019re estimating restructuring spend of about $1 billion with no offsetting gains. For the full year, as we said, we expect gains to equal restructuring but there will be variability by quarter.","Next, I\u2019ll cover the individual segments. First, I\u2019ll start with power. Power orders in the fourth quarter totaled $11.1 billion, higher by 16%. Organic orders in the quarter including Alstom organic grew 14%. Core GE orders of $8.3 billion were lower by 4% and Alstom orders of $2.8 billion grew a 160%, organically. Equipment orders grew 1%. Core equipment orders of $3.3 billion were down 28% on lower gas turbines, 22 versus 55 a year ago. We received orders for 8 H turbines in the quarter versus 12 last year, bringing total H orders to 25 for the year and an ending backlog of 32.","Alstom equipment was strong with $1.7 billion of orders including 26 HRSGs versus six last year and 11 steam turbines versus two last year. Organically, Alstom equipment orders grew four times. Service orders were $6.1 billion, up 32% with GE core services up 24% to $4.9 billion and Alstom orders grew $1.2 billion. We booked orders for 58 AGPs in the quarter versus 42 last year.","Total service upgrades including AGPs grew 87%. Alstom service grew orders 61% organically with strength in India, the Middle East and Africa. Backlog finished the year at $84.7 billion, up 10%; core GE backlog grew 8% and Alstom\u2019s backlog of $18.3 billion grew 18%. Revenues of $8.5 billion grew 20%; core GE revenues of $6.5 billion were up 6%, driven by equipment higher by 10% and services up 4%. Equipment revenue grew on gas turbine shipments of 35 units versus 28 last year, including 9 Hs for a total of 26 Hs for the year. Service growth was driven by 27 more AGPs in last year, 62 versus 35, offset partly by fewer installations. Total AGP shipments for the year were 145. Total Alstom revenues of $1.9 billion grew 83% organically. Operating profit of $2.1 billion was up 27%; core operating profit was $1.7 billion and Alstom contributed $359 million in the quarter.","Core earnings were flat on higher volume, favorable FX and positive value gap offset by the mix impact of 9 Hs this year versus zero last year. H margins are positive and continuing to improve but still well below the margins on our mature F products. Alstom synergies were 454 in the quarter and $1.1 billion for the year. The business shipped 104 gas turbines this year; we\u2019d expected to ship a 110 to 115. We expected to ship six more units but those transactions did not close in the quarter, but we expect that those units will close in 2017. In addition, although aero turbines were up in the year, we expected to ship more in the fourth quarter; again, we think those units will likely close in 2017.","We operate in very tough geographies in this business. It is always 500 megawatts or gigawatt of deals that are hard to close, and it\u2019s been the nature of the business over the last several years. And we expect this dynamic to continue into the future. In 2017, we expect a flat market in gigawatts. For the year, we are planning on a 100 to 105 gas turbine shipments. We have a strong equipment backlog of $70.6 billion, which is up 27% and a strong services backlog of $67 billion, which was up 6%.","The Alstom integration performed well this year with total year orders of $10 billion, building a backlog that is up 18% and delivering over $1 billion of synergies in the year. Our outlook for power remains consistent with the expectations shared at the outlook meeting albeit off of lower base. As we said in December, we expect double-digit earnings growth in power in 2017. In order to achieve that, we need to execute on Alstom, product margin improvements and deliver services growth. Lastly, the team has to deliver the incremental cost out actions given the market conditions we face.","Next is renewables. Renewable energy had a strong orders quarter. Orders in total grew 32% to $3.3 billion. Core GE wind orders were higher by 48% to over $3 billion. We took orders for 1,180 turbines versus 827 last year, up 43%, principally in the U.S. where the orders were up 54%, driven by the safe harbor qualification 2016 for 100% PTC benefit going forward. Units were higher by 43% and megawatts were up 54% on the larger 2 and 3 megawatt turbines.","The business also booked $300 million of additional repower upgrades in services. Alstom orders, principally hydro were $290 million in the quarter. Backlog finished the year at $13.1 billion with GE core up 68%. Revenues in the quarter grew 29% to $2.5 billion with GE core revenue up 20%. The business shipped 786 turbines versus 847 last year, but the megawatts shipped were up 11% on the larger units. Alstom revenues of $279 million were higher by a 161% organically. Operating profit of $163 million was up 3X on better Alstom results. The core business was down 8% on increased NPI spending on the 2 and 3 megawatt turbines, lower price and foreign exchange, partly offset by volume growth and some product cost out. Alstom generated $48 million of profit in the quarter on strong synergies. For the year, the team delivered about $200 million of synergies, well above the plan, driven by sourcing and SG&A efficiency, particularly in hydro.","We expect renewables to have a solid 2017 and contribute double-digit earnings improvement. The unique repower upgrade offering we expect will continue momentum and the team is making good progress in driving down cost of the new NPIs, critical given the competiveness in the industry. We expect to close the LM Wind Power acquisition in the first half and the vertical integration of blades will also help drive results.","In aviation, we had another solid quarter in the fourth. From a demand perspective, global passenger air travel continued to grow strongly with RPKs up 6.1% year-to-date November with strength of both domestic and international routes. Air freight volumes grew 3.2% year-to-date in November. Orders in the quarter were $7.2 billion, up 5% with equipment orders higher by 2%. Commercial engine orders were down 4% on lower CF-6, CFM and GEnx orders, partially offset by strong GE90 and LEAP orders. $1.8 billion of new commercial engine orders included $478 million from LEAP, a $186 million in orders for CFM, $577 million orders for GEnx and $326 million in orders for GE90. Military equipment orders of $360 million were up 2%, driven by another large T700 order for 306 units.","Service orders grew 8% in the quarter, commercial service orders were higher by 16% with CSA growth of 22% and spare orders up 14% during the to an ADOR of $44.5 million a day. Military service orders were down 18% and $480 million on tough comparisons. Backlog finished the year at a $155 billion, up 2% with equipment backlog of $33.3 billion, down 5% and service backlog of $121 billion, up 4%. Revenues grew 7% in the quarter to $7.2 billion. Equivalent revenue was up 1%, driven by commercial growth of 8% with 692 engine deliveries versus 643 last year, including 44 LEAP engines. This was partly offset by military down 35% on lower shipments. Service revenue was higher by 12%; commercial spares rate was 43.5 million a day, up 18%.","Our profit in the quarter totaled $1.7 billion, up 11%, primarily driven by favorable price, volume and productivity, partly offset by the LEAP mix; margins expanded at 100 basis points in the quarter. Aviation had a very good year. The business shipped its first LEAP engines and currently 20 A320neos powered by LEAP are flying across six different customers. Reliability has been excellent and the engines are performing to spec. We had expected to ship a total of about 100 engines in 2016, but in coordination with the airframers, we delivered 77 for the total year, meeting all our commercial commitments. These units will now deliver in 2017 with total shipments of about 500 LEAP engines for next year. The team is also executing in leading our additive strategy. RKM and Concept Laser are great platform additions to our capability. We believe 2017 will be another solid year of execution in aviation.","In oil and gas, the environment continues to be challenging and activity levels remain muted, external market indicators appear to be stabilizing with expected more balanced supply and demand fundamentals, partly influenced by the recent OPEC production agreement. U.S. onshore rig count grew 33% versus the third quarter, but was essentially flat versus the beginning of the year. Forecasted E&P spending is expected to be flat to modestly up in 2017. The business had an encouraging orders quarter. Orders of $3.3 billion were flat year-over-year and up 2% organically. Orders for all business segments were up sequentially versus the third quarter. Equipments orders grew 4% versus last year with TMS up 48%, subsea up 26% and surface up 25%, downstream was down 45% on no repeatable large African order last year. Service orders were down 3% with TMS up strongly at 40%, offset by digital, downstream, subsea and surface which were all lower.","Orders for the total year were down 27%. Backlog finished the year at $21 billion, down 9% versus last year run, with equipment down 32% and services growth up 7%. Revenues in the quarter were down 22% with equipment down 25% and service down 19%. Revenues for the year were also down 22%. Operating profit of $411 million was down 43% on lower volume and price, partly offset by cost out which totals a $170 million in the quarter. Total cost out actions, for the year were $700 million. Total cost out over the last two years was $1.3 billion.","2016 was an extremely difficult year for oil and gas, and the business expects the first half of 2017 will continue to remain challenging with sequential improvements in the second half of the year. Offshore drilling and subsea activity will likely remain low in 2017. Consistent with what we discussed at the December outlook meeting, we expect the business to deliver lower earnings in 2017. Increased activity in North America onshore and stabilization in the Middle East and Europe are needed to drive improvement in our shorter cycle and surface businesses in the second half. We\u2019ve made significant progress on integration efforts with Baker Hughes and have dedicated more than 200 people to it. We gave you an update on December 8th, no change to that outlook, and we expect to close the deal in mid-year.","Next up is healthcare. Healthcare had a good quarter. Orders grew 3% to $5.4 billion. Organic orders were strong in emerging markets, up 10%, led by China higher by 19% and Latin America up 16%. Europe orders were higher by 6% organically and the U.S. was lower by 1% organically.","In terms of business lines, healthcare systems orders grew organically by 3% with imaging up 5% on strength in CT, MI, and ultrasound, partly offset by lower LCS. Life sciences orders grew 6% with bioprocess higher by 7% and core imaging up 6%. Healthcare orders for the total year grew 3% reported and grew 5% organically.","Revenues in the quarter grew 3%. HCS revenue grew 2% organically with ultrasound up 6% and imaging up 2%. Life sciences continued to deliver strong growth with revenue growing 9% organically, driven by bioprocess higher by 15%. Healthcare revenues for the total year grew 4% reported and 5% organically. Operating profit of more than $1 billion grew 10% in the quarter, volume and strong cost productivity more than offset lower price and higher digital spending. Margins expanded 130 basis points in the fourth quarter. Healthcare executed strongly in 2016, delivering good organic growth and operating leverage and earnings. They delivered $450 million of cost out versus $350 million target. Margins for the year expanded 100 basis points.","In 2017, we expect the same focus on cost and product competitiveness with similar results. We will launch 25 new products and are targeting a point of share in 2017. We expect China, Africa and Asia Pacific to continue their strong growth. Europe is expected to be roughly stable, while the U.S. maybe a bit slower due to the uncertainty around the repeal or replace of the Affordable Care Act.","Next on transportation, fourth quarter carload volume improved modestly, up 2.1%, driven by intermodal carloads up 3.4% and commodity carloads up 90 basis points. Commodity volume was driven by agriculture, which was higher by 7.4%, metals were higher by 25% and chemicals were higher by 2.4%, which was partly offset by coal down by 2.8% and petroleum down almost 16%. Notwithstanding the improvement in the quarter, we expect 2017 to continue to be difficult for volume growth. Year-to-date, carload volume was down 4.5%, driven by intermodal down 1.5% and commodities down over 7%.","Transportation orders of $1.4 billion were down 58%, consistent with the North American market. Equipment orders of $64 million were down 98% on no locomotive orders versus 1,113 units last year, including the large 10-year, 1,000 loco India order.","Service orders of $1.3 billion were very strong, up 2X, driven by large multiyear modernization order to retrofit 500 locomotives of the North American class one railroad over five years. Backlog finished the year at $20.1 billion, down $2.4 billion, driven by equipment liquidation.","Revenues in the quarter were down 23% with equipment down 38% and services up 2%. We shipped 171 locos in the quarter versus 320 last year. Services grew 2% on higher contractual services, partly offset by lower spare parts.","Operating profit of $370 million was down 6%, primarily driven by lower volumes, partially offset by cost out and restructuring benefits and mix. Margins exceeded 450 basis points in the quarter. The transportation team executed well in 2016 in a very tough environment. Consistent with the outlook meeting, we expect 2017 to be even tougher with expected loco shipments down 50%, pressuring operating profit down double-digits. Having said that, we expect the team will outperform the industry.","Next Energy Connections & Lightening, orders for the segment totaled $3.1 billion with energy connection orders of $2.8 billion and current orders of just under $300 million. Energy connection orders grew 8% reported; organically including Alstom, orders grew 5%. Power conversion was lower by 23% on continued headwinds in oil and gas. Industrial solutions was down 1%, but outperformed the North American market by a couple of points in the quarter; and grid orders of $1.5 billion grew 27% in the quarter.","Revenues for energy connections were higher 15% and up 16% organically including Alstom. Power Conversion revenues were down 18%, industrial solutions were down 3% and grid grew 56% revenues in the quarter. Current and lighting revenues were down 14% with current growing 5% and legacy business declining 26%, as we continue to resize the business downward.","Operating profit in the quarter totaled $102 million, Energy connections are $98 million and current and lightening $3 million. Energy connections earnings were driven by a $100 million of grid earnings, $42 million of industrial solutions earnings, up 59% partly offset by power conversion which was down. Alstom synergy execution was strong in 2016, delivering $226 million of benefits, above our target of $175 million. In 2016, the market backdrop for these businesses was tough, but it was not a good execution year either.","In 2017, we expect this segment to deliver double digit earnings improvement with better execution in industrial solutions, lighting and power conversion, and we expect grid to continue to perform well. Our estimate is the industrial solutions divestment will happen later in the year.","Finally, I\u2019ll cover GE Capital. The verticals earned $478 million in this quarter, up 9% from prior year, driven principally by lower impairments in EFS. GECAS, EFS in industrial finance all had strong quarters and overall portfolio quality remains same.","In the fourth quarter, the verticals funded $3.8 billion of on book volume and contributed through enabling $5 billion of industrial orders. Other continuing operations generated $262 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, preferred dividends, restructuring costs related to the portfolio transformation and headquarter operating costs partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down, because excess debt matures and we right size the organization structure. Discontinued operations shown $3 million of income with gains and other related items largely offset by operating costs. Overall, GE Capital reported net income of $218 million.","We ended the quarter with $93 billion of ENI excluding liquidity with continuing ENI of 82 billion. Liquidity at the end of the fourth quarter was $51 billion. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter, we closed $17 billion of transactions, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $190 billion. We have signed agreements for an additional $4 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the total signings to a $197 billion, which essentially completes our plan given that the majority of the remaining assets will run off as it makes better economic sense.","We remain on track for 1.1 times price to tangible book that we initially estimated. GE Capital paid $4 billion of dividends during the fourth quarter for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the original $18 billion target for the year; dividends of $5 billion ahead of the original plan announced in April of 2015. Overall, the GE Capital team delivered a strong verticals performance while executing on all aspects of the exit plan.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks Jeff. We have no change to our 2017 framework. Let me take you through the pieces. Orders grew by 2% in the quarter organically; oil and gas seems to have bottomed; and services are very strong. Alstom is generating orders growth. So, we see a line of sight for the 3% to 5% organic growth for the year. We\u2019re executing on $1 billion incremental cost outplay with plenty of restructuring to support it. So, we see our way to a 100 basis points of margin enhancement. Alstom is executing well and should have EPS at the high-end of our range, and we end the year with good momentum and working capital. Meanwhile, GE Capital continues to execute on their transition to an industrial finance company.","So to confirm on 2017, we see EPS of a $1.60 to $1.70; operating cash flow of $16 billion to $20 billion; and cash to investors of $19 billion to $21 billion in buyback and dividends. So, a good outlook for the Company, a solid year in 2016, and now Matt, let me turn it back over to you.","Matt Cribbins","Great. Thanks, Jeff. With that, operator, let\u2019s open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","I know we\u2019ve talked in December about the election, but now that you\u2019ve had a couple of months, I mean what are your customers -- I understand healthcare could get pushed out a little bit, but what are your customers in power and renewables and in some of these other areas where you could have some regulatory uncertainty; is there a risk that they push back orders or delay projects, things like that; I mean clearly just the U.S., but how do you think about that, Jeff?","Jeff Immelt","Scott, I\u2019ll take a crack. I would say, we haven\u2019t really seen much change so far. I think if I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most, I would say both attention and the media and by our customers. I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven\u2019t really seen that much, but that could happen. I think on the renewables side, really with the PTC over the next few years, I think that\u2019s pretty much locked in place. And then, I still think the basic thesis around gas power in the U.S. remains intact as it pertains to being a base-load technology in the future. But then, I think outside the U.S., I really haven\u2019t seen much change in interplay, post the election in terms of what our customers are saying and how to think. I don\u2019t know, Jeff, would you add anything to that?","Jeff Bornstein","I think that\u2019s the lay of the land, Scott.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","I just wanted to focus on aviation. So, I guess you had a very good EBIT number in Q4, helped by the gain and the high-teens growth in commercial spare sales. Should we think that that profit growth levels out in the first half of 2017? You don\u2019t get the same growth rate in spares presumably LEAP shipments catch up after a light Q4. And then, also longer term, your commercial engine orders were down about 940 units in 2016 overall. How are you thinking about the cycle and your commercial OE revenues?","Jeff Bornstein","Well, let me start with the few things, and I\u2019ll let Jeff weigh in. The gain was not recorded in aviation, okay? That was recorded at corporate; it was offset in restructuring. So, none of the gains results are reflected in the segment performance at aviation. We had a strong spares year this year; we\u2019re up double-digits. Our expectation is the spares sales rate, the ADOR will not be up that strongly next year; we\u2019re thinking high single-digits. And I think our expectations are as Jeff shared with you in December is that we\u2019re going to continue to grow the operating profit in aviation actually notwithstanding the LEAP shipments. So, right now, our estimate is we\u2019ll ship something close to 500 million -- 500 LEAP engines next year, and that\u2019s factored into that outlook. And we expect the services business partly with the spares growth I just talked about to continue to grow smartly in 2017.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I think just to echo, Julian, what Jeff said, I think the two things I think about aviation is the business model as it pertains to services and revenue, cash flow models and things like that. I think investors should feel great about that. And then execution on the LEAP, and I think Jeff laid out the LEAP shipments; we\u2019re kind of on learning curve. And those two elements I think really are the ones that dictate aviation growth. But we feel -- we think the aviation team did a good job in 2016, and they\u2019re well-positioned to do another good job in 2017.","Jeff Bornstein","And their commercial equipment backlog is very strong. We took fewer orders on new commercial equipment engines in 2016, but the backlog is very strong.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Since I only have one question, I\u2019d love to focus on cash here. And within that, Jeff, is there any factoring this quarter from GE Capital into GE industrial? And then also, while it\u2019s the strongest cash flow quarter in a while, still a little bit below what we thought you guys implied when we talked about it before, and then as you think about it progressing through 2017 and beyond, maybe just talk a little more about kind of the cash flow initiatives comp that really can give investors confidence that the cash flow part of the story is improving.","Jeff Bornstein","Okay. There is a lot in that. So, let me start with the fourth quarter, Steve. So, we improved working capital in fourth quarter about $5.2 billion, which best we can tell is the strongest working capital quarter the Company\u2019s ever had. And I want to just give you some of the thesis on that. So, within working capital, accounts receivable generated about $0.5 billion; $1.2 billion generation in inventory; $1.8 billion generation in AP, a lot of that being renegotiated terms. We talked about realigning or aligning suppliers with customers in terms of the time sync between build and collect. And then, $1.7 billion on progress, orders were a bit better; as a result, progress is a bit better. And that\u2019s how you get the $5.2 billion.","So within that, accounts receivable performance, you asked about factoring. For the total year, practically with GE Capital was at $1.6 billion change for the year. It was $1.7 billion last year. So, actually year-to-year, it was $100 million less of a benefit in the year between what we did with GE Capital around factoring. And in the fourth quarter importantly and you see it because our receivables improved $500 million is from the third to fourth quarter of 2015, the benefit was $2.3 billion, the benefit going from this past third quarter to this quarter was $700 million. So, it was actually down $1.6 billion year-to-year between third and fourth quarter each in those years. So, this very good underlying performance here, it\u2019s not just about -- it\u2019s actually very little to do with GE Capital factoring.","Jeff Immelt","Steve, I would add. I think the one piece that we\u2019re still not happy with in terms of Q4\u2019s inventory, and I think we generated -- we reduced working capital by $3 billion for the year and still didn\u2019t do, what I think either Jeff or I want to see on inventory. We expect inventory to go down by $2 billion next year, and we think that\u2019s going to give us a momentum as it pertains to CFOA and working capital in 2017.","Jeff Bornstein","So, let me just follow-up and answer that part of your question. So, we came in $11.6 billion of industrial CFOA. We were shooting to be something closer to $12 billion of CFOA in the latest update we gave you. When you subtract CapEx and industrial free cash flow, we ended up at $8.9 billion, and that was actually right in the middle of the range we gave you coming into the year on industrial free cash flow. But the 400 light is really all about inventory, and it\u2019s essentially the $1 billion roughly, the $1 billion sales miss left more in inventory than we expected, not all of that would have converted to receivables and then from receivables would have converted to cash, but a significant piece of it would have been. So, I would say on industrial free cash flow basis, a couple of hundred million lighter; on industrial CFOA, closer to $400 million lighter; and most of it\u2019s about at volume not going out to door, not being rev rec.","Jeff Immelt","And this is all in people\u2019s incentive plans for 2016 and 2017.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa with JP Morgan.","Steve Tusa","So, we are getting a lot of obviously questions around tax policy, and we\u2019ve gotten a lot of questions from investors on you guys have a relatively low tax rate as it is, but there is some conversation we\u2019ve had with investors that say you can go substantially lower, something like almost to like a zero to 5% type of range. I can\u2019t quite get there just doing the high level math. So, maybe if you could just give us some color on how your tax guys are looking at what\u2019s out there from a tax policy perspective?","Jeff Bornstein","So, at this point, see, this is all speculation. Right? I mean, the only point of reference you have is a little bit of what\u2019s coming out of new the administration and then what exists in the form of the Brady bill in House Ways and Means. And I think what GE wants and what we think is most important to competitiveness for U.S. companies is essentially a competitive tax rate, something that looks more like the OECD averages, which is just roughly 21%, 22%. And this notion of territoriality that you pay the tax in the jurisdiction that you actually earn it and then from there those earnings are fungible and can move cross border. Those are the essential things.","And then, as a transition item on historical foreign earnings, the companies left offshore, we want a reasonable transition tax if one is necessary in order to true up the historical performance. The real delta between that is a minimum to make U.S. companies more competitive, put them on an equal footing with most of the people we compete with, countries we compete with, is question about border adjustability. And as I am sure you understand and it\u2019s the way border adjustability has been described, there is an incentive for exporters to export more, because there is essentially no tax on exports, and that\u2019s about trying to drive more production and manufacturing into the U.S.","So, if a company is net exporter, you could envision on the border adjustability, they pay a lot lower tax rate against those export against U.S. But you\u2019re going to remember in the case of General Electric, 55%, 60% of what we do, we do outside the U.S. Order adjustability doesn\u2019t impact at all what we pay for taxes in Sweden, Switzerland, or the UK, Japan and China. And so, although you may -- companies may find themselves in place with a relatively lower U.S. tax liability, I don\u2019t think it changes in anyway how they think about what their foreign tax liabilities are.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Jeff, can you give us a little more color on your power business? It\u2019s understandable that you would see some delays in shipments; it\u2019s a pretty difficult market. But, did you see any incremental delays in closing deals toward the end of the year; and was it a result of GE being more careful around financing or customers just wanting to delay delivery? And then, you mentioned you still expect double-digit earnings growth in power, but how dependent are you on some of these delayed turbine shipments to reach your 2017 forecast?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. So, maybe I\u2019ll start, Jeff. So, a couple of things happened in the fourth quarter. We had six, arguably seven, but I would say six gas turbines that we absolutely thought were going to ship. Four of those were 13E2 class turbines that were going into Bahrain and Iraq. And these are enormously difficult geographies to get stuff done. And right up to the end of the year, we thought those transactions were going to go; they didn\u2019t end up going. I think we are confident they will go in the first half of 2017. ","The fact with two 9Es that were going to West Africa, and as it turns out, in the end the customer came back and we thought whether they wanted 9Es which we had made an inventory and whether they actually might want to go with an H class turbine instead. So that likely will book as an order in 2017, not clearly yet whether if it converts to an H, whether we\u2019ll ship in 2017.","And then I\u2019d say, the last piece is although for the year we did pretty good on aero turbines, we were up about 10 units for the year, we were down 10 units year-over-year in the fourth quarter, and we missed about seven trailer mounts in the fourth quarter. And again, we are talking about places like Libya, Iraq, really, really difficult geographies where we just didn\u2019t get those short cycle convertible TMs across the finish line. I think our outlook for TMs and aero derivatives largely remains intact for 2017. They are just really difficult, difficult transactions to get across the line. ","And I\u2019d say the last thing is, although we had a good AGP quarter, we did 145 for the year, very close to -- right in the middle of what we guided, we expected to do more than 145 AGPs for the year and other upgrades, Dry Low NOx, DLNs; we had built sets because we thought we could deliver incremental upgrades here in the fourth quarter, and some of those just moved to the right. We didn\u2019t get all the upgrades we thought we\u2019d get done in the quarter and that\u2019s really the delta in the fourth quarter as it relates to power.","Now, when you think about next year, it\u2019s really, as I said earlier, there is three or four things we need to happen. So, Alstom performed very well in power in 2016. We over delivered on synergies, the business delivered everything they said they were going to do around Alstom, orders were very, very strong. The backlog from the time of closing until year end is up 18% year-over-year, very strong up on the equipment, even stronger than the 18%. So, we need the power business to deliver the incremental improvement in Alstom from 2016 to 2017.","We need our service business to do more or less what they did this year. The service business for the year grew operating profit about 7%; we\u2019re looking for mid single digits, that kind of performance in 2017. We got to deliver the structural cost out, just given where we are in the industry and the volatility. And then, the last one is we took a lot of headwind this year on the H launch, both the ramp of the H and the individual unit cost. Now, the units we shipped in the second half of the year were profitable, significantly more profitable than the beginning of the year, but still much less profitable than a lot of the F technology that they are replacing. And so, we\u2019re looking for that turnaround, a meaningful turnaround, hundreds of millions of dollars in 2017. As we come down not just the cost curve on the H but you\u2019ll notice in our orders OPI, we\u2019ve been getting price on the H for the last five quarters in a row. And so we think prices are much better as we deliver 23 Hs in 2017.","Operator","The next question is from Shannon O\u2019Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan","Hey, just a follow-up on the power and also in renewables, as you think about ramping the development programs; both those segments on a core basis had margins down, power 150, renewables 160 this quarter. How do they turn around in 2017; I mean, do both of those still, do you envision the core piece having up margins and how much of this swing in the development programs is part of that versus other factors?","Jeff Bornstein","Maybe, I\u2019ll start, Shannon. I think the development programs explain a ton of turnaround year-over-year. I think in the case of the power business, the H investment was -- I don\u2019t know, $300 million or $400 million of headwind in 2016 versus 2015. We think most of that turns around. In the case of the onshore wind business, were going through a big product conversion process in 2016 as well. So, I think we feel like on both those cases, we should see core margin enhancement going into 2017, and that\u2019s both on what I would say, both on the development side and also on the product cost side.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I think on the H, we just talked about that, both price and unit cost, and less development cost. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more complicated than that. On renewables, you don\u2019t have the price element; price is a real challenge in onshore wind turbine. Some of it\u2019s the competitiveness around giving the repower -- I\u2019m sorry, the PTC Safe Harbor orders. So, in renewables, it\u2019s a little bit of program cost around the 2.X turbines and 3.X turbines, it\u2019s a lot our about product unit cost and volume. So, we\u2019re going to ship order of magnitudes a number similar to what we did this year, roughly 3,000 wind turbines. But in addition to that, we\u2019re likely going to do more than 800 million -- 800 repower units in 2017. So, we expect the volume to be up materially and that also to contribute with volume leverage to the margin improvement year-to-year.","Operator","Our final question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Obin","Just going back to the question overall revenue, as we look at your revenues versus consensus, it just seems that revenues are relatively weak relative consensus across the board. And usually, you guys hit the numbers pretty close. And it\u2019s not just power, it seems to be across the board. And just has anything happened broadly in the last two weeks of the year after the analyst meeting to drive this slowdown; is there sort of a broader development that explains it? Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","I mean, I think Andrew, I would say the fourth quarter organic revenue was power up 15, renewables up 26, oil and gas down 21, aviation up 6, transportation down 22, healthcare up 3, and energy connections up 16. So, the total organic revenue growth was up 4% for the quarter. I think clearly power is explainable. I think clearly oil and gas, even though I like the orders performance in oil & gas, it\u2019s a harder segment to call. I think other than that, Andrew, it\u2019s really just noise. It\u2019s $31 billion or $30 billion to $35 billion a quarter. There is going to be puts and takes on a revenue line. But I think if you go down, if you think about 2017 as being an organic guide of up 3 to 5, and you\u2019ve got 4% organic in Q4 in revenue, I feel pretty secure about the 3 to 5 guide for 2017. I just think you\u2019ve got to look at it that way. Look, power didn\u2019t do as much revenue as we would have liked. It was still substantially up organically, up 5% organically without Alstom and up 15% with Alstom. So, that\u2019s not bad.","Jeff Bornstein","I would just add to that, Andrew. So, power is like no question; oil and gas is like mostly transaction of convertible volume less than the team was forecasting. Everything else is actually better. When you add up the rest of the portfolio against our framework, they came in higher on revenue.","Matt Cribbins","Oka, great. Couple of quick announcements before we wrap. The replay of today\u2019s call will be available this afternoon on our investor website and our first quarter 2017 earnings call will on April 21st. We\u2019ll also be holding our annual shareholders\u2019 meeting on April 26th in Asheville, North Carolina. Jeff, back to you.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. So, Matt, just to wrap up, again, I think the team\u2019s focused on 2017. Here is the ways that the GE team is compensated as they look forward into next year, 3% to 5% organic growth, we just kind of went through the pieces of that; 100 basis points of margin enhancement, I think combination of run rate and incremental cost out actions already in play; and strong free cash flow and dispositions. I think good momentum in Q4, more work to do, but I feel like the momentum around the Company is very good. So, we are aligned with what we showed you in December and off and executing. Thanks, Matt.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew Cribbins","Good morning and thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. Today I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. Earlier today, we posted a press release, presentation, and supplemental on our Investor website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Matt.","GE had a good quarter in a slow growth environment. We continue to see challenges in the resource sector as customers adjust to a lower price environment. Globally growth continues but at a low level. There is sufficient opportunity out there to achieve our goals.","At the same time we plan to control our costs even tighter as we navigate this environment. GE grew organically by 1% and EPS grew by 10%. Segment profit grew by 1% year-to-date ex-FX. Industrial margins were up 40 basis points again excluding foreign exchange.","CFOA was $8 billion including $2.9 billion of industrial cash flow. We ended the quarter with $319 billion of backlog and we accomplished our financial goals despite the impact of $0.04 per share and foreign exchange headwinds year-to-date.","We continue to execute our capital allocation plan. We have virtually completed our pivot and financial services with 193 billion of signings. Year-to-date we've returned $24.6 billion to investors through dividends and buyback.","For the year we're increasing the buyback by $4 billion from $18 billion to $22 billion and total cash return to investors will be at least $30 billion for the year. We continue to invest in the company. In the quarter we announced investments in additive manufacturing, digital platforms and wind turbine supply chain. These will add to earnings in 2018 and position the company in fast growth markets in the future.","Orders were $26.9 billion down 6%. Alstom orders were $5.2 billion and backlog is up $3.2 billion since the acquisition. Overall backlog is up 6% versus a year ago with service backlog up 11%. We had substantial strength in renewables, healthcare and power. Renewables grew by 59% including our first substantial offshore order at $600 million and $400 million order to repower the installed base.","Healthcare HCS equipment had a strongest orders growth in five years at 12%. This includes 12% growth in the United States and 15% in China. Aviation service orders were up 10% and growth market orders up 21%.","Oil & Gas orders were down 21% in the quarter. There are still pockets of growth. Our Middle East orders grew by 5% and Latin America was up by 19%. We ended the quarter with $22 billion of backlog and we expect fourth quarter orders to be about flat with the year ago.","AGPs remain on track for 135 to 150 in the year. Software orders were about $900 million in 3Q up 11% and at $2.8 million for 50% year-to-date. We saw a significant growth and power of 72%, Oil & Gas up 10%, transportation up 21% and Grid up 43%.","Customer wins include Gairdow, NEC, Aramco, Haier, and CN. We continue to build our foundation for growth. We have 243 partners on Predix and are on track for 20,000 developers by year-end. Our productivity at $500 million is already above target and should be strong for the year.","We see order strengthening in the fourth quarter versus a year ago and that will position us for 2017. GE is executing well in the environment. As I said earlier, organic growth was up 1%. Excluding Oil & Gas organic revenue growth is up 6% in the third quarter and 4% year-to-date.","We had several strong business performances. Power was up 7% with 15% growth in equipment, renewables grew 44%, aviation service was up 12% and the GE contributed the growth with vertical financing which supported $4.2 billion of industrial orders and meanwhile GE to GE revenue which is a measure of internal pull-through grew by 25%.","Organic growth is accelerating through the year. The fourth quarter will be up 4% and for the year we expect organic growth to be 0% to 2%. We continue to see a drag in Oil & Gas with revenue down 15% to 20% for the year and the rest of GE will grow at a healthy pace.","The Oil & Gas team is executing well in a tough environment. We continue to aggressively manage cost while positioning for long-term growth. The business fully leverages the GE store and will come out of the cycle stronger.","Core margins grew by 40 basis points and gross margins grew by 110 basis points ex-FX. We\u2019ve see solid work in value gap and cost productivity slightly offset by mix. Service margins again led the way with 220 basis points of expansion. Our analytical tools have been critical to enhance service margins.","Our businesses have done a nice job in a slow growth environment. For instance transportation grew margins by 90 basis points, despite lower volume. We continue to invest in the growth and competitiveness of GE. Alstom remains on track and we're building backlog and winning key new orders. We're on track for synergies of 1.2 billion in the year.","Year-to-date Alstom Motors orders were $12.7 billion up 13% versus 2015. We put forward more restructuring which should help 2017 and beyond. Alstom remains on track to deliver $0.05 of EPS this year ex-FX and we expect to complete purchase accounting in the fourth quarter by booking an incremental reserve of $2.4 billion to cover customer contracts and legal and tax reserves. This is consistent with expectations. The net present value of synergies is more than $21 billion and Alstom will generate a mid-teen return over time.","In September we announced the acquisition of SLM and Arcam which will position GE as a leader in the fast growth market for additive manufacturing equipment while opening up potential for an additional $3 billion to $5 billion of productivity over time","Also in September we announced the acquisition of Meridium, a leader in asset performance management. This completes our suite of maintenance optimization, machine and equipment health and reliability management. It's a perfect fit for digital strategy and will accelerate our growth.","Last week we announced the acquisition of LM Wind Power. This gives us enhance margins and technical expertise. In addition this opens up growth in emerging markets. LM and GE have a deep pipeline of innovation which will lead the industry.","We have pretty good quarter for cash, industrial CFOA was $2.9 billion up 13% from 2015. Year-to-date free cash flow was $17.3 billion including a capital dividend of $5 million. We received an additional $2 billion dividend from Capital in October.","In the fourth quarter we expect industrial CFOA to be more than $9 billion based on higher earnings and lower working capital. In addition, we should receive a $4 billion dividend from GE Capital. So for the year, we expect free cash flow plus dispositions to be more than $32 billion above our goal.","As I noted earlier, we continue to invest in long-term growth and competitiveness and with the improved outlook on CFOA, we plan to boost our buyback by $4 billion to $22 billion with a total cash return to investors expected to be $30 billion including the dividend. Our balance sheet remains very strong. All of our cash metrics looks solid for the year.","So now let me turn it over to Jeff to go through our operations.","Jeffrey Bornstein ","Thanks Jeff. I will start with the third quarter summary.","Revenues of $29.3 billion up 4% in the quarter, industrial revenues were up 5% to $26.7 billion. You can see on the right side that industrial segments were up 4% reported and up 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion.","Industrial, operating plus verticals EPS was $0.32 in the quarter up 10%. The operating EPS number of $0.27 includes other continuing GE Capital activity including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I\u2019ll cover on the GE Capital.","Continuing EPS of $0.23 includes the impact of non-operating pension, the net EPS of $0.22 includes discontinued operations. Total disc-ops impact was a charge of $103 million in the quarter driven by GE Capital exit cost.","As Jeff said we generated $18.3 billion of CFOA year-to-date up from $6.5 billion last year driven by increased dividends from GE Capital. Excluding deal taxes, industrial CFOA was $3.4 billion year-to-date down 45%. We generated $2.9 billion of industrial CFOA in the third quarter which was up 13% versus last year. This is driven primarily by working capital improvement in receivables and inventory.","Progress collection was a usage in the quarter on lower order principally in Oil & Gas. Free cash flow was up 70% and free cash flow conversion was 93% in the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow conversion for the mismatch of gain income and cash which is included in other investing activities, free cash flow conversion would be 99%. Alstom generated 25 million of CFOA in the quarter.","As Jeff said earlier we now expect GE capital dividends for the year of $20 billion versus the planned $18 billion. Fourth quarter will be another large industrial cash quarter on $5 billion of cash income and continued progress on working capital principally around inventories related to higher volume of deliveries in the quarter. Industrial CFOA is expected to generate between $11 billion and $12 billion cash for the total year.","The tax rate was 11% in the quarter bringing the year-to-date tax rate to 13%. In the third quarter we adopted an accounting standards change related to the treatment of tax benefits on stock option exercises which had a favorable impact on our 3Q tax rate of about two points. The impact on our year-to-date rate was about one point.","Given that change, we now expect the total year GE rate to be in the low teens versus the mid-teens rate we guided previously. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable reflecting the tax benefit on pretax continuing loss.","On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned industrial segment revenues were up 4% reported and up 1% organically. Excluding Oil & Gas which has clearly been challenging, organic revenue was up 6% with strength in power renewable, aviation and healthcare.","Industrial segment op profit was down 5% reported and down 3% organically. The organic number excludes the impact of 14 million of FX translation headwind. We also had an additional 120 million of negative FX transactional impacts year-over-year which is not adjusted for the organic calculation. This related to remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges principally in Oil & Gas renewables and Energy Connections. Excluding all FX organic operating profit was flat in the quarter.","Including corporate operating costs, industrial op profit was down 6% reported and down 4% organically and flat excluding all FX. As you see at the bottom of the page and as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.32 up 10% with industrial operating EPS up 8%. On a year-to-date basis we delivered at $1.03 of EPS which was up 29% versus the prior year.","Next on industrial and other items for the quarter. We had $0.05 of charges related to industrial, restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $683 million on a pretax basis with $200 million related to Alstom synergies, investments that we've made to drive results. $100 million related to continue cost out actions in Oil & Gas and actions taken in lighting and other segments.","We also closed the asset management transaction in the quarter resulting in a $400 million pretax gain. This gain was partially offset by a charge associated with the anticipated sale of our majority share in a nonstrategic business in aviation that makes aero structures. The net gains for the quarter were $0.02.","At the bottom of the page you can see the profile for 2016. We continue to expect gains in restructuring to offset for the year at about $0.24 both in earnings and charges. Next I'll cover these segments.","First is power, power orders in the quarter totaled $7.5 billion up 56% including Alstom. Excluding Alstom orders were $4.7 billion down 3%. Core equipment orders were flat at $1.7 billion. Gas power system orders were higher by 6% driven by aero and gas turbines offset partially by Distributed Power resets.","We booked 36 aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 26 last year but strong demand in sub-Saharan Africa and Argentina. Gas turbine units were 11 versus 22 a year ago. Although the number of units were lower, the dollar value of the orders were up 10% on much larger units, principally the H with six units ordered versus four last year.","We have 33 Hs in backlog and received orders for 50 inception to-date on the progress. One of the H orders in the quarter for three units was full scope and included additional Alstom scope totaling 760 million. We continue to see a real opportunity for growth and equipment pull-through between GE and the Alstom businesses. Core equipment backlog grew 34% versus last year.","Core service orders of 3 billion were lower by 4% on lower Power Services driven by no repeat of a large flange upgrades in last year and timing on 10 AGP order. AGP orders in the quarter were 24 versus 22 last year. We have worked 50% of the 10 AGPs and moved to the fourth quarter as of this call and are still on track for the year for 135 to 150 AGPs in total.","Alstom orders in the quarter were $2.8 billion, equipment orders totaled $2 billion including $1.1 billion for the Hinkley Point U.K. power project. We also booked another 3 HRSGs and three steam turbines related to the full scope H1s I mentioned earlier.","Alstom service orders were just under 900 million. Alstom backlog ended the quarter at 17.7 billion which is up 50% since the acquisition with equipment up 49% and services down slightly. Power revenue in the quarter totaled $6.5 billion up 37%, core GE revenue $5.1 billion was higher by 7%, core equipment revenue of $2 billion grew 50% driven by gas power systems higher by 60%.","We shipped 30 gas turbines including seven Hs versus 16 a year ago. Power units were higher by nine versus last year. Core services revenues of $3.1 billion grew 2% on outage volume and upgrades. We shipped 28 AGPs in the quarter versus 22 a year ago. Alstom revenue in the quarter totaled $1.5 billion with $530 million of equipment and $920 million of service revenues.","Operating profit and total was just shy of $1.2 billion with core op profit of $1.1 billion and Alstom op profit of $91 million. Core earnings were higher by 3% on positive value gap and volume partially offset by the mix impact of 70 Hs versus zero last year.","The Hs we shipped in the third quarter were profitable but drove a 70 basis point margin contraction in the quarter. The $91 million of Alstom earnings included a $16 million FX headwind. Through the third quarter the team has delivered $650 million of Alstom synergies versus 777 total year target that we shared with you last year and the business is delivering on H profitability in the second half. For the year we expect to ship 25 H turbines and about 110 to 115 gas turbines in total.","Next up is renewable, orders in the quarter totaled 3 billion up 59%. Core orders excluding Alstom of $1.9 billion grew 3%. Core orders are driven by large service orders for $400 million associated with repowering and upgrading of existing units offset partly by fewer new unit orders of 592 turbines versus 821 a year ago.","Over 90% of the new unit orders were the large new machines. We expect fourth quarter orders to be strong as the final fully qualified US PTC orders are placed. Repowering, upgrades and new units provide a strong outlook for the fourth quarter in the future.","Alstom orders in the quarter totaled 1 billion driven by large offshore wind win in Germany of over $600 million and $400 million of Hydro orders. Backlog finished the quarter with $12.9 billion.","Revenues of $2.8 billion grew 66% with core GE revenues up $2.4 billion higher by 43%. The business shipped 970 wind units versus 735 wind units in the third quarter of last year. Alstom revenue totaled 381 million in the quarter.","Operating profit $202 million was up 68% with a core business higher by 22%, driven by higher volume offsetting negative foreign exchange. Our profit rate was down 150 basis points excluding Alstom reflecting new product mix and $58 million of negative foreign exchange versus last year.","We continue to improve margins of the new 2 megawatt machine. Alstom synergies in the quarter totaled $46 million and Alstom op profit was a loss of $12 million. For the year we now expect to ship 3000 to 3200 wind turbines versus the 3000 we had previously communicated to you.","Next on aviation, our global passenger air travel continues to see strong growth despite a slight increase in capacity relative to demand. Year-to-date August traffic was up 5.8% with strength in both domestic and international markets. Airfreight volumes were up 1.4% August year-to-date with FTKs growing 3.9% year-over-year versus last year.","Orders in the quarter were $6.2 billion down 6%. Equipment orders of $2.1 billion were down 27% and lower commercial engine orders driven by 9X, GE90 and GEnx. In the quarter we booked $1.4 billion of new engine orders including about $400 million in LEAP, 250 million of CFM and 350 million of GEnx.","Military equipment orders of $204 million were up sharply driven principally by T700 orders from Turkey. Total equipment backlog of $33.7 billion was down 4%. Service orders grew 10% with commercial service orders up 13% driven by CSAs up strongly in 29%, overhaul up 9% and the spares order rate up 6% at $42 million a day.","Military service orders were down 12% on non repeatable large Air Force over the last year. Total service backlog grew 15% to $122 billion. Revenues of $6.3 billion were up 5%. Equipment revenue was down 3% with commercial up 5% on higher delivers including 22 LEAP engines while military equipment revenue was down 33% on lower shipments.","Service revenues were higher by 12%. The commercial spares shipment rate was up 5% to $39.7 million a day. Operating profit of $1.5 billion was up 10% driven by higher volume and cost productivity. Margin rates improved 120 basis points in the quarter.","Third quarter was another solid execution quarter for the aviation team and we're on track to the ramp up on LEAP shipments this year. We have shipped 33 LEAP engines today and there are currently six LEAP power planes flying with two airlines with the departure performance of 100% and some of those planes are operating more than 10 cycles a day. We expect to deliver about 105 engines this year.","Next is Oil & Gas. The industry remains very challenging. Some market indicators show a modest sequential improvement in the third quarter. U.S. onshore rig counts were higher by 15% versus the second quarter and U.S. well counts rose 3% versus the second quarter.","Both rig and well counts remain down about 50% from where they were last year. External forecast for upstream spending for 2016 have been revised to be less negative and with 2017 slightly more positive. Flow markets on our industrial applications remain stable but Oil & Gas flow and OpEx markets continue to be weak.","Orders for Oil & Gas of $2.5 billion were down 21% in the quarter with equipment down 22% and services down 21%. All segments are equipment declines except subsea drilling which was up 33% on easier comparisons last year. Service orders declined in all segments.","Backlog ended the quarter at $21.6 billion which is down 7%. Equipment backlog down 32% versus last year while services backlog grew 40%. Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 25% with equipment revenue down 33%. All segments were lower except downstream technologies which grew 16% in the third quarter.","Service revenues were down 16% with declines across all the segments. Op profit $353 million was down 42% driven by lower volume, price and foreign-exchange partially offset by cost execution. The business took out $245 million of costs in the quarter.","Total cost out year-to-date is $535 million. The team expects to deliver total cost out for the year of between $700 million and $800 million adjusting for cost actions related to volume. The business remains on track for op profit down about 30% excluding the effects of foreign exchange. No doubt it's an incredibly tough environment but Lorenzo and the team have executed well on their cost out initiatives and capturing available growth opportunities as they present themselves.","On healthcare, healthcare business had another solid quarter. Orders in the quarter grew 6% to $4.8 billion. In terms of geography orders grew organically 5% in the U.S., 6% in Europe and 10% in Asia-Pacific. China orders were up 2% but up 13% excluding the KUBio bioprocess facility order we took last year.","In terms of business lines healthcare systems organic orders were up 8%, driven by strength in the imaging up 12% on strong CT and MI, and Ultrasound higher by 11%. Life science orders grew 4% organically with bioprocess and core imaging both up 5%.","Excluding the prior-year KUBio order I just referred to, life science orders grew 11% with bioprocess higher by 22%. Revenues in the quarter of $4.5 billion were up 5%, healthcare systems revenues grew 4% organic with Ultrasound higher by 13% partly offset by imaging down 1%. Life sciences grew revenues 11% organically.","Op profit was up 10% in the third quarter and up 12% organically. Strong volume and cost performance more than offset price and programs. Margin rates expanded 70 basis points in the quarter, gross margins improved 90 basis points in the quarter.","Healthcare continues to execute, through three quarters they have delivered over 300 million against their 350 million of cost out commitments for the year. We expect to outperform the 50 basis point margin goal.","China growth continues to improve, public tender activity up 20% in the third quarter and the U.S. and Europe markets are seeing stable growth.","Next is transportation. The difficult cycle for transportation continued in the third quarter. North American carloads were down 5.4% driven by coal lower by 14.6%, petroleum down 23.4%. Intermodal volume was down 3.6%. August and September volumes did improve versus July and are still well below 2015. We expect the trend to continue through year-end.","Orders in the third quarter of $695 million were down 21% and down 15% organically. Equipment orders of $109 million were down 23%, but up 18% organically on orders for five locomotives versus three year.","Service orders of $586 million were down 21% driven by lower loco parts and mining. Backlog ended the quarter at $19.9 billion which was essentially flat with last year. Revenues in the third quarter of $1.249 billion were down 22%, down 17% organically with equipment lower by 22% and services lower by 13%.","We shipped 200 loco versus 259 a year ago. Op profit of $309 million was down 18% on lower volume partially offset by positive mix, and the benefits of restructuring. Gross margins improved to 180 basis points and op profit margins were higher by 90 basis points.","The business continues to grow its international businesses. Demand in the US continues to be a challenge while driving hard on products and service costs. We expect total year locomotive shipments of between 740 and 750 units.","Energy Connections and Lighting, this is the first new presentation of the two segments together. The businesses have not changed. We are reporting orders for Lighting for the first time. Lighting has really has two businesses, the current business in the legacy core Lighting business, which we are in the process of restructuring.","The current business represents professional lighting sales for North America and other key countries, energy management and control systems and software. Reported orders in backlog applied to only the current business as these are longer-term projects.","Orders for the segments totaled $3 billion with Energy Connection orders of $2.7 billion and current orders of $328 million. Energy Connection orders were up 31% reported with core GE orders of $1.4 billion, down 14% organically.","Power Conversion was down 33% on tough comparisons last year when our renewables orders were up four times. Industrial Solutions orders were up 6% in the market that was down 4% North America.","Grid orders totaled $1.4 billion in the quarter. Total backlog finished at $11.5 billion. Current orders of $328 million were driven by LED retrofits including large orders from financial services. Revenues for Energy Connections were $2.6 billion, up 45%.","Core energy connection revenues were down 9% organic with Power Conversion down 12% and Industrial Solutions down 7%. Grid revenues totaled $1.4 billion. Lighting revenues were down 8% with current growing revenues 10% and Legacy Lighting down 22% as the non-LED market continues to decline and we restructure and exit many markets.","Operating profit in the quarter of $48 million was driven by $63 million of earnings from Energy Connections and $50 million loss in Lighting. Energy Connection had $64 million of profit from grid and a small loss in the core. The core is driven by lower volume, foreign exchange and mix partly offset by value again.","The lighting loss is driven by build-out of our current business. The segment continues to make incremental progress, improving each of the last three quarters and we expect the fourth quarter will improve again relative to the third quarter.","Next I'll cover on the GE Capital. Our vertical businesses earned $466 million in this quarter, up 33% from prior-year driven by lower impairments and energy finance partially offset by lower gains.","GE Caps energy financing and industrial finance all had strong quarters and overall portfolio quality remains stable. In the third quarter the verticals funded $2.8 billion of un-book volume and enabled $4.2 billion of industrial orders.","Other continuing operations generated $441 million loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, restructuring costs related to portfolio of transformation and headquarter operating cost partially offset by tax benefits. These costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we rightsize the organizations structure.","Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $100 million largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets partially offset by tax benefits and other items. Overall, GE capital reported a $78 million loss.","We ended the quarter with $103 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity with continuing ENI of $79 billion. Liquidity at the end of the quarter was $57 billion. Asset sales remained ahead of plan. During the quarter we closed $16 billion of transactions bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $173 billion.","We have signed agreement for an additional $12 billion in the third quarter, bringing the total signing to a $193 billion. We expect to be largest done with signings by the end of the year and we're on track for the 1.1 times price to tangible book that we originally has.","GE Capital paid $5 billion of dividends during the third quarter. In October they paid an additional $2 billion and we expect an incremental $2 billion dividend before the end of the year, for a total of $20 billion in 2016 versus the $18 billion target.","Overall the Capital team has continued to execute ahead of schedule on all aspects of the plan that we shared with you 18 months ago. We expect to be largely complete by the end of 2016.","And with that I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks Jeff.","Now let me punch through our operating metrics for 2016. We are nearing the EPS range to $1.48 to $1.52. In this number we're offsetting $0.46 of FX headwind. We expect organic growth to be positive but near the low end of the range. In our corporate cost control and margin execution remain very strong.","Free cash flow plus dispositions will be above plan mainly due to GE Capital dividends. Although the cash metrics remain on track and we're increasing the buyback from $18 billion to $22 billion and this makes the total cash return to investors $30 billion for the year ahead of plan. So in a time of volatility the GE model is performing.","Finally let me reflect on the company's earnings going forward. When we launched the capital repositioning in April of 2015 we established the goal of $2 EPS by 2018. Since then our outlook for Oil & Gas has worsened and foreign exchange serves most global companies and GE is no exception. At the same time the rest of GE is performing well and we see that continuing in the future. And we should be even better than our original plan for buyback and Alstom continues to perform at or above plan.","Going forward we plan to drive out more cost and supply chain program spend around product launches and corporate. And we will continue to grow our funding on digital transformation. Incremental leverage exists with the idea of pushing beyond our goals. We'll give you our 2017 outlook in December but all of our metrics for compensation purposes will continue to be linked to $2 of EPS in 2018 are aligned with investors.","Matt, back over to you for questions.","Matthew Cribbins","Thanks, Jeff. I'll now ask the operator to open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning, guys. Your final comments, Jeff, were interesting. I mean, A, you're not backing off the $2 number, which is a relief to some of us. But your comment about potentially stretching leverage, can you be a little bit more clear on what that means? Is there a comfort level around ratios that you have now that's increased versus maybe where you were before? Is there a comfort level around M&A and the stuff that's available? Just give us a little bit more there, please.","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, Scott really I didn\u2019t mean to change at all the way we thought about leverage in the past. I think what I try to differentiate is the built-in toolboxes always assume that without leverage that we - the extent to which we do incremental buyback or M&A it should push about that point, so that was really the only context for the point on leverage.","Scott Davis","Okay. So still a $2 plus-plus in using\u2026","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, in other words we are trying to do the build, our intention is to not change the bridge the way we've articulated over the last couple of years.","Scott Davis","Okay, okay; that's helpful. Then just as a quick follow-up, your Energy Connections is not a business I know very well, but the margin is pretty weak there. You said you're doing restructuring. What do you think a pro forma margin looks like in that business once you are done with your restructuring?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, here is what I say Scott is it's really three businesses and it starts with the Grid business which is combination of our Legacy Grid business and Alstom business. That business I think is or I think we think is performing actually quite well in around $64 million in the quarter, it's delivering on all the Alstom synergies that we talked about delivering.","And then you have Power Conversion business which has a higher concentration in Oil & Gas historically than the balance of Energy Connections. That part of that of the Power Conversion businesses has been enormously challenged. We've replaced lot of that volume with renewables volume. The renewables volume was not as profitable as what we\u2019re doing in Oil & Gas and so Power Conversion has been a challenge. We've been breakeven to lose a little bit of money here through the first three quarters.","And then that leaves you with our legacy Industrial Solutions business which had a reasonably - a good orders quarter I mentioned earlier, up 6% on orders in the North American market that feels like it was down 4% but on execution and revenue in the quarter was less than what we expected it to deliver.","That business ought to earn between $100 million and $140 million a year. The Power Conversion business until oil turns around I think it\u2019s going to be a little bit of a challenge and we have a good outlook for our Grid business. So when we think about 2017 we expect the Energy Connections business to be a meaningful contributor to earnings growth where we move from this year to next.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys; good morning. Just to be clear on the new profit guide for the fourth quarter - for the year, I think the Street's around $18 billion. I think backing into using your free cash flow guidance and backing into what that would imply for a profit guide for the fourth quarter, somewhere in the $6 billion to $6.5 billion range. Is that the right number?","Jeffrey Immelt","I think that's about right. That's within a row of apple Steve, that what we're at strategically.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Hi, thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the components exactly behind the revenue growth guidance reduction. What proportion are coming from, say, Transport or Power? And then when you're thinking about the scope for recovery, timing and magnitude, how are you communicating on that in light of the weak ongoing order intake?","Jeffrey Immelt","Well I think revenue is primarily Oil & Gas Julian, with maybe just a touch in some of the other ones but I would think about it in that context. And then again I would come back and talk through backlog growing, service backlog particularly strong as being a big driver of organic growth and the fact that kind of underlying Alstom orders that will play out in kind of '17 and beyond are actually quite strong as well.","So I view orders as being kind of more or less in line with our expectations as a build-up for what we have to do in '17 and '18 and then Q4, I think we believe will be a pretty good orders quarter as well. I don\u2019t know Jeff if you want to add to that?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, let me address revenue. So when you think about the year we had 1% organic revenue in the third quarter. When you exclude Oil & Gas if you get back to the rest of the portfolio, in the third quarter our organic revenue grew 6%, on a third quarter year-to-date basis it grew 4% and we expect it to be really solid excellent gas, really solid organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter.","So the 2 to 4, moving from 2% to 4% to 0% to 2% is mostly about where we think the revenue number is going to end up with Oil & Gas. Having said all of that, we've not changed our outlook on Oil & Gas our profit of the year ex-foreign exchange we still think plus or minus that's about 30% down.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. I just want to go, Jeff - either Jeff, really - to the extent that you can provide color on just how to think about the underpinnings of the bridge to 2018. What I mean by that is we're still at $1.50 midpoint for 2016, but we're now looking at segment OP of $1 billion lower. So we've got lower tax and other things going on, we see this change in goodwill at Alstom. I don't know if there's other moving parts. But can you give us any thoughts on the OP ramp in your business to 2018?","Jeffrey Immelt","Why don\u2019t I start and then Jeff you. So what I would say Jeff if you just context in 2016, I'd say headwind in Oil & Gas, headwind in foreign exchange in 2016. We think some of the foreign exchange actually comes back our way in \u201817 and \u201918. We think Oil & Gas is going to continue as you look forward to be a drag. Our team is doing a really good job. We\u2019re executing well. We\u2019re taking cost out. But we\u2019re not really forecasting a hockey-stick in Oil & Gas.","The rest of the industrial portfolio really which grew 8% ex FX, I think it's well positioned to continue to drive good solid growth over the next few years. Alstom is on plan. We think the Alstom return still looks solid and the Alstom earnings outlook for \u201917 and \u201918 still looks solid. We're going to continue to execute on the buyback right. So those were the main - those are the main components.","And then what I would add to that Jeff, is just a context of driving corporate cost lower, continuing to work hard on incremental opportunities on supply chain that we see and accelerating progress in gross margins.","So I think the way you got to think about it is incremental intensity around cost that we see in our line of sight, sustained good growth in our industrial portfolio. Some of the FX headwind we've seen should come back to us over the next few years just by the way the contracts are written. Buyback at or ahead of plan and that realizes the context for an Oil & Gas business that we\u2019re executing well but you know we\u2019re trying to be a prudent about how we think about it over the next couple of years.","Jeffrey Bornstein","I would just add. When you think about that framework or initially put it together clearly Oil & Gas cycle is the single biggest challenge against that framework and we\u2019re going to be much more aggressive around cost as a result of it. The rest of the portfolio I think is what as Jeff described it and we\u2019re going to try to be a little bit better on buyback.","Jeffrey Immelt","And I think the last point guys, I just would make a point that, the guidance range of 1.48 to 1.52 this year that's with us eating $0.04 to $0.06 a share of FX in that number right. So I think underlying execution in the context of where we are is still pretty strong this year.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys. Jeff, you talked last quarter about services order growth rising to the mid-single digits in the second half of the year, and organic orders did turn positive this quarter after being negative last quarter, but were still pretty low at plus 1%. Do you still see a sustainable mid single-digit growth in orders given continued weakness in Oil & Gas and Transportation? Is the real issue still just the timing of AGP orders? And what are the chances that AGP orders slip in the current environment?","Jeffrey Immelt","So Andrew I\u2019d say a couple of things. Firstly on AGPs, I think we feel reasonably confident about the guide that we've given you on 135 to 150 for the year. So I don't think that at the moment is a point of concern for us. We did talk about mid-to-high single-digit service orders in the second half of the year. We still see that in the fourth quarter. We see mid-to-high single-digit service orders organically.","What's really changed versus what we said at the end of second quarter it has been around equipment and most of the change in equipment has been about Oil & Gas where we\u2019re about 3 billion lower in Oil & Gas orders and that's really about three projects, it\u2019s really three distinct projects that have been delayed or suspended has changed our outlook. And so equipment is going to be softer than what we said at the end of second quarter. I don't think there is any change to how we see service orders here.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Okay thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker","Thanks and good morning, all. I just want to go back to Oil & Gas. Last December you guys had talked about more room in the $1 billion of cost-out, which was like $600 million in 2015, $400 million in 2016; and you thought you might be able to raise that $400 million to $800 million. Sounds like you've just said you are on track to that for this year.","But as I start looking at this worsening environment, you say you're going to continue to be aggressive in costs. It starts to really raise the question for me of how much more you can do here, other than ongoing Lean and productivity in terms of real, major thinning out going forward to offset what are continuing really significant pressures. I know you've talked about it generally, but any more precision on that front as we look further than the fourth quarter would be helpful.","Jeffrey Bornstein","So, Steve, your math is exactly right. So we said, and I think I said 700 million to 800 million of incremental cost of this year on Oil & Gas to three quarters they delivered about 530 million of that. They will deliver all the actions to get to 800. We might not realize all 800, because some of those savings were volume related. In other words, if the volumes were not there you don\u2019t actually get to hit the cost savings, although when the volume comes back in a lapse will be there.","I think Lorenzo and the team would say, there are additional incremental cost actions we are going to continue to work into 2017. I think you're right. I think the depth of which you can continue to cut cost is somewhat limited, but there is still incremental additional actions that the team contain.","I think our comment on more cost actions is generally is more of a statement across the entirety of the company given what's happened in Oil & Gas, around program cost, structure, corporate. There are more opportunities that we\u2019re going to run to, to try to compensate for the fact that Oil & Gas is we expect going to earn less than what we originally thought when we gave it $2 framework 18 months ago.","Jeffrey Immelt","I would - I think Jeff said it exactly right. And then you know what I would say Steve is look, the \u2013 our overall context for Oil & Gas hasn't changed. We still think it's a really good GE business, leverages the GE store and I have every confidence we\u2019re going to come out of the cycle, a better than we win in.","But I think, I would echo what Jeff said, I think we continue to see good opportunities in corporate. We also continue to see good opportunities around our footprint and supply chain. You know, we've had a chance now to look across the Alstom and GE kind of factory base and things like that and we see some incremental opportunities that we think are going allow us both up from sourcing standpoint and a supply-chain standpoint, and will be able to do that and still do the investments we need to make in digital as we go forward. So, I think that's the right context.","Operator","The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Morning, guys. On cash flow, progress collections I think you said was still a pressure. It would seem like that should be close to bottoming. What's that going to be this year, and where do you see that heading? And just any other metrics or dynamics you've been working on cash flow-wise in 2Q, just maybe give us an update.","Jeffrey Immelt","Well, progress was a bit of a challenge in the third quarter for exploration. We definitely delivered better working capital performance in the third quarter, progress as a little bit a drag, that reflects equipment orders and that's largely where we thought Oil & Gas might be in third and fourth quarter where we are seeing now.","Now. so have - two or three \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, two or three big orders Porsche, meaningfully - meaningful size, orders that would have brought a lot of cash with it. We\u2019re down year-to-date. The fourth quarter will be better than the run rates through the first three quarters and we expect progress actually contribute in the fourth quarter to our CFOA performance that we talked about earlier.","Shannon O'Callaghan","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning. Not going to ask you a question on Oil & Gas; just to shift a little bit to Predix. In your presentation you say that the number of partners has quadrupled on a sequential basis. Are there any revenue and profit implications from that going to next year? Because it does seem to be running quite a bit ahead of expectations.","Jeffrey Immelt","I wouldn't change it yet. Andrew, we will talk more about this at Minds and Machines in a little while, but clearly on the partners side with Predix, I think we\u2019re ahead of where we had envisioned, but we will update those numbers in the middle of November, when we when we go to mine machine.","Andrew Obin","But partners does have revenue implications, right? Because there --","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, no, seriously the - you know for instance, we partner with people. They immediately add developers and they have revenue goals, so we expect - we expect this to be a good boost to how we think about revenue over Predix over the both short and long-term.","Andrew Obin","Thank you.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, I would just add. Listen, we had a goal here to sign 50 partners for over 200. That's really positive momentum both from a technology perspective and ultimately longer-term in terms of actually generating orders in revenue.","We are way ahead on where we thought would be on people developing on Predix. Jeff said, all these metrics to be updated Minds + Machines, but I think there is reasonably good momentum here.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Thanks; good morning, everyone. I wanted to go back to Jeff's question from earlier. When I look at what you guys gave out in EPG, you had about 5% Industrial growth ex-Alstom coming through in the $2 earnings bridge. So we're running this year, call it down mid to high single digits. So have you guys updated that number? Is that number going to be running closer to 2% to 3% in that bridge?","And then my second question really is around the buybacks. The buybacks are running ahead of schedule. I think you've done about $25 billion by the end of this year of the $35 billion. So is there upside to that number? Thank you.","Jeffrey Immelt","So, we will update you on the bridge. Jeff will update you on the bridge when we get to EPG.","Jeffrey Bornstein","When we get into year-end.","Jeffrey Immelt","Yes, I am sorry, the outlook meeting in December, we\u2019ll go back to the bridge. We\u2019ll go back through all three pieces that we've shared with you before. I don't think we see at the moment any real change from the Alstom.","We may be a bit better on buyback accretion which is partially answered your second question. And we'll walk you through the dynamics in the organic portfolio growth over that period of time. So more detail to come on that.","On buyback, I think we\u2019re absolutely ahead of plan. I think the $4 billion incremental buyback year - in the year I think is important. As you know, we are constantly going back and evaluating our capital allocation plans, most of which we've shared with you on what makes sense, and to the extent it make sense to be more aggressive with buyback we will do that.","On the leverage question, we\u2019re mostly focused around M&A, so I wouldn't read through on that and leverage equals buyback. I think that we had in our capital allocation plan we had capital available for M&A, buybacks and other reasons and right now we\u2019re being a little bit more aggressive in buyback.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC.","Deane Dray","Thank you; good morning, everyone. Like to stay on that capital allocation theme, Jeff Bornstein, right where you finished off there. Because the plan had been to toggle between buybacks and M&A depending on the returns. Are you implying at all that there's fewer opportunities in M&A today versus the attractiveness in GE stock in terms of - increasing the buyback?","And then also on M&A, maybe some additional color on the LM wind turbine blade acquisition. Is this the same derisking of the supply chain we saw in Avio? Maybe expand on that, why it gives you better strength in emerging markets.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, so on the capital allocation question, we are not changing any way in terms of how we are thinking about to trade between M&A and buyback, and certainly with the stock is $28 to$29 the buyback looks quite attractive to us.","We\u2019re not short ideas on M&A I don't think. We're constantly evaluating M&A opportunities I think just what we announced recently here between SLM and Arcam which is an investment that\u2019s going to huge payback longer-term and most recently the LM acquisition.","We are continuing to evaluate M&A opportunities. So I wouldn't read too is we are short ideas on M&A, which is I think would like to be more aggressive around the stock given the outperformance by GE Capital in terms of what they are returning to us and operationally you know, what we\u2019re able to do through our capital allocation model that was unrelated to M&A and leverage.","Jeffrey Immelt","So I would just say Deane, I think Avio was the right way to think about LM. We see good opportunities in the supply chain. We think the next few years visibly we have on wind is pretty solid in terms of PTC and our global demand. We think between us and LM, we've got good technology that can really innovate in the industry and what we saw on Avio we are able to keep the non-GE base in Avio and we think we can do the same thing with LM. ","Lastly your question it really bolsters us in China and India and lot of the emerging markets where we see growth potential for us in the future. So we look at as a reasonably low risk investment where a lot of the leverage on our control and we have I think a disproportionate upside if we execute well.","Deane Dray","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe","Thanks for fitting me in here, guys. Good morning. First of all, just a clarification on the buyback. The $4 billion extra this year, that's not a pullforward from next year? We're still looking at 14, 15 for next year. But my primary question is on the margin side. Obviously good news on gross margins, good news from price cost. But what's driving the SG&A inflation, because there's about 150 bps of higher SG&A? So if you can just address those two questions, thanks.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Okay. So first on a buyback let me be absolute. The $4 billion buyback is an increase of the model we gave you that went through 2018. That we are buying 4 billion more stock than we said we would when we gave you the plan through 2018.","On SG&A so in the third quarter structural SG&A was up 1%, that was 12.6% of sales, third quarter year-to-date were actually down 4%, about 30% of sales. It was a bit of a drag in the quarter probably because SG&A was up 1% and volume was essentially down slightly on the calculation basis. So it ended up being about 10 basis point drag in the quarter.","Other inflation that sits in the other line is associated with inflation on based cost, and most of that is EOP. There is other indirect expenses that also incur inflation and that's what you see on outline. Other inflation ex-FX, if you take out the impact of FX of some of those marks go through the other line in that walk with a negative 60 basis points as opposed to what we showed you in the morning.","Nigel Coe ","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Matthew Cribbins","Okay. Couple of quick announcements Jeff before you wrap up. The replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. We'll be holding the Minds and Machines conference in San Francisco on November 2016 and our annual outlook meeting on December 14. Again we will be holding our fourth quarter earnings call on January 20. Jeff?","Jeffrey Immelt ","Great, Matt. Thanks. Just a couple points to wrap up, I think we plan to have a solid Q4 and wrap up really solid 2016. Looking forward I think we are being realistic about the environment in the resource sector, Oil & Gas, but don't be mistaken we still I think this is a core GE business in one where our teams managing it extremely well through the cycle. The rest of GE is executing very well.","Alstom remains on track in 2017 and 2018. The buybacks ahead of plan. We got a really good line of site to incrementally take more cost out of the company and be even more efficient. And all of our compensation plans whether it's long-term incentive plan or the AIP which is IC plan all tied to the bridge that we showed you in 2015 and where we march and 2016, 2017, 2018.","So we are aligned with investors Matt and we're - I think we're quite confident in the performance of the company.","Matthew Cribbins","Great. Thank you for joining.","Operator","This concludes your conference call. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect."],"10351":["General Electric Co.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Steve Winoker Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Brandon. Good morning, all and welcome to GE\u2019s first quarter 2019 earnings call. I am joined by our Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp and CFO, Jamie Miller. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the press release presentation, supplemental, and 10-Q have been available since earlier today on our investor website. We are pleased to file our 10-Q in concert with our earnings, a practice we began in October with our third quarter earnings report. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward looking and are based in our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","With that, I will hand the call over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Steve thanks. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. I will begin with an overview of our first quarter performance and an update on our strategic priorities, Jamie will cover the quarter in greater detail and then we will take you through segment performance and I will wrap up before we go to questions.","To start, as we said in March, on our outlook call, 2019 is a reset year for GE as we make decisions and investments that will position us well for the long-term, but we will have near-term impacts on our financial performance, particularly our cash flows. And while we have made some progress in the first quarter delivering results ahead of our own expectations, especially on industrial free cash flows, this is largely due to timing of certain orders and customer collections we expected later in the year. You know as well as I do that one quarter is a data point, not a trend. The guidance we provided a month ago remains unchanged. It\u2019s early in the year and this is one quarter in a multi-year transformation. In total, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our full year expectations that we laid out for you last month during the outlook call. We continue to believe that our 2020 and 2021 financial results will be meaningfully better.","With respect to the quarter, orders were up 9% organically due to strength in Power, Aviation and Oil and Gas. Industrial revenue was up 5% organically driven by growth in each segment, except for Power. Industrial operating margins contracted 160 basis points organically driven by declines in Power, Renewable Energy and Aviation. And all of this resulted in adjusted EPS of $0.14 and GAAP continuing EPS of $0.11. Our adjusted industrial free cash flow was a negative $1.2 billion, which was significantly better than our expectations. In Power and Aviation, orders and customer collections came through earlier than we had anticipated. While there were puts and takes, these timing items should balance out over the remainder of 2019. We had higher earnings than we expected and saw some improvements in execution, but again, it\u2019s early.","I will talk to this in more detail when I cover our strategic priorities on the next slide. Throughout the remainder of this year, we will make significant investments in our future, such as restructuring, which will be second half loaded. As we said on the outlook call, we have not planned for profession meaning we had built in general contingencies to cover potential shortfalls related to market and execution risks. However, the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX was not included in our original planning and presents a new risk.","With respect to the MAX, first let me express our deepest condolences to the families and friends of all those lost in the tragic accidents in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The flying public\u2019s confidence in the safety of flight is the foundation of the aviation industry and we all take that responsibility as paramount. We have a strong partnership with Boeing. We are confident in the 737 MAX aircraft. We are working closely with Boeing through the recertification process. And while the planes are on the ground, we are conducting proactive scheduled maintenance on the engines. The timing of the MAXs\u2019 return to service is uncertain and we are carefully managing our own operations accordingly.","Turning to Slide 3, this is a game of interests and we have a long way to go. Yet we made some progress in the first quarter on our two strategic priorities. We\u2019ve taken action to improve our financial position. This includes the announcement of the sale of BioPharma to Danaher, which results in about $20 billion of cash proceeds and gives us flexibility and optionality on our remaining healthcare business as well as the closing of GE Transportation, which delivered $2.9 billion in cash while retaining approximately 25% stake in Wabtec which we intend to monetize over time beginning in the second quarter.","At GE Capital, we completed $1 billion of capital asset reductions we paid down $2 billion of external debt and closed the MUFG transaction in the quarter. We have ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position, with more than $30 billion of cash in industrial and capital combined. We still have work to do, but we are committed to running GE on a stronger financial foundation. Our other strategic priority is strengthening the businesses, starting with Power. We are focused on running more empowered, accountable businesses that connect our operating plans to our customer\u2019s successes. The power turnaround is in the early stages as we adjust to market realities, move past some non-operational headwinds and improve our daily execution. In our operating reviews on our plant floors and in our job sites, I see plenty of improvement opportunities and frankly take encouragement from the early signs of progress such as deep assessments that are candid about where we\u2019re winning and losing, a reemergence of lead in all that we do and a conviction on the part of this team that we can improve and we will win. We also booked about 4.5 gigawatts of equipment orders at Gas Power in the quarter. These orders are primarily U.S. contracts at good margins.","At Aviation and Healthcare, we are playing offense and we saw continued order strength, with Aviation up 7 and healthcare systems up 5. At Renewable Energy, we are managing through the PTC cycle, which is creating cash headwinds at the business this year. But all the while we continue to invest for the long term with our next generation offshore and onshore wind platforms Haliade-X and Cypress and at capital we continue to de-risk the portfolio. We settled the DoJ FIRREA investigation of WMC for $1.5 billion and completed our insurance statutory cash flow test and $1.9 billion funding in line with our plan.","Stepping back, GE has important meaningful businesses operating from positions of strength. We have exceptional technology in which we continue to invest, with a valuable installed base and recurring revenue streams. Today our installed base of approximately 70,000 aircraft engines, 7,000 gas and aero turbines, as well as more than 4 million healthcare systems and 40,000 onshore wind turbines, all of which helped drive over 50% of our revenues, which come from supporting and servicing that installed base.","Our digital team continues to unlock the value of that installed base by turning machine data into powerful insights and outcomes for GE businesses and our customers. Our backlog today stands at $374 billion, up 6% from a year ago. We have a global network of close customer relationships and a highly respected brand. Most importantly, we have a capable team showing grit, resilience and commitment. So we made some progress in the quarter, but as I said, it\u2019s just one quarter in a multi-year journey. With better execution and a stronger balance sheet we will continue over time to create sustainable shareholder value.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it over to Jamie to go through the quarter in greater detail.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, Larry. I will start with the first quarter summary. Note that our results on a continuing basis include transportation and its history, which was reclassified to discontinued operations this quarter. Also our Lighting business is now included in our corporate results. Orders were $26.2 billion, up 1% reported and up 9% organically with strength in equipment orders up 11% organically driven by Power, Healthcare and Oil & Gas. Services orders were up 7% organically driven principally by Aviation. Revenue was down 2% with Industrial segment revenues down 2% on a reported basis and up 5% organically driven by Aviation, Oil & Gas and Healthcare. Both equipment and services revenues were up 5% organically.","Adjusted industrial profit margins were 8.8% in the quarter, down 120 basis points year-over-year on a reported basis and down 160 basis points on an organic basis driven by significant declines in Renewables, Aviation and Power. Aviation margins were down primarily from the CFM to LEAP engine transition, margin contraction in the first quarter was in line with our expectation and we continue to expect industrial margin expansion for the year. Net earnings per share, was $0.40 which includes discontinued operations for both GE Capital and Transportation. In the quarter, we recorded a $2.5 billion after-tax gain related to the sale of Transportation to Wabtec, which is included in discontinued operations. GAAP continuing EPS was $0.11 and adjusted EPS was $0.14.","I will walk through adjusted EPS on the right hand side of the page. Starting from GAAP continuing EPS of $0.11, we had $0.05 of gains, principally from the sale of ServiceMax, as well as a gain from a favorable resolution on an NBCU tax audit for which we had indemnified Comcast. On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.03 of charges, principally in corporate and power as we continue our cost out actions for those segments in line with our stated plan. Non-operating pension and other benefit plans were a drag of $0.05 in the quarter. And lastly, during the quarter, final regulations on the US tax reform transition tax were issued, which resulted in an update to our computation of transition tax and tax impacts for 2017 and 2018. This resulted in a $0.01 negative impact in Industrial and a $0.01 favorable impact in GE Capital, offsetting at the Company level. Excluding these items, adjusted EPS was $0.14 in the quarter.","Moving to cash, as Larry mentioned, adjusted industrial free cash flow was a usage of $1.2 billion for the quarter, but $500 million better than the prior year. Income, depreciation and amortization totaled $2.1 billion, up $300 million as expected working capital was negative for the quarter as we built inventory for second half volume largely in renewables onshore wind and we saw progress collection reductions in renewables and gas power as we executed on backlog. Contract assets were a cash usage of $600 million largely in gas power equipment projects. In addition, renewables deferred inventory build was higher due to delays in onshore wind unit shipments. Other CFOA was negative, primarily driven by annual employee bonuses and other compensation. We also spent about $900 million in gross CapEx or $600 million ex-Baker Hughes GE, which is down $100 million versus prior year. Overall, we are encouraged by strong cash performance in Aviation and Power, but we continue to manage through the renewables PTC cycle volume execution, power variability, restructuring, long term receivables factoring run-off and other items.","And before we move on, let me provide more color on the quarter and the outlook for the industrial free cash flow. First, timing was the biggest driver of our significantly better than planned cash flows this quarter. With our large equipment focused businesses, there can be substantial variability quarter-to-quarter on factors ranging from orders timing to project execution milestones and related collections and disbursements. In the first quarter at Power and Aviation, orders and customer collections came in earlier than we expected while disbursements were lower. We anticipate these timing items will largely balance out over the year in line with our full year outlook.","Second, we saw favorability in restructuring NBD this quarter and we expect that the supply chain finance transition will begin to impact free cash flow in the second half. In addition, we saw improved execution in the quarter as our teams are working hard to drive results. Third, looking forward, our 2019 guidance for industrial free cash flow is unchanged in the range of negative 2 to 0. We are evaluating further opportunities to de-risk the balance sheet and believe that we have planned appropriately for various market and execution risks that could arise across a number of our businesses, including Renewables and Power. As Larry noted earlier, the Boeing 737 MAX was outside the scope of our original planning. Specifically on the MAX, we have not changed our engine production plans at this time, but the timing of cash flows may be impacted by collections of receivables from Boeing depending on when aircraft deliveries resume. We will continue to adjust our operational management as this situation evolves.","Moving to liquidity, we ended the first quarter with $17 billion of industrial cash excluding Baker Hughes GE. As we discussed, industrial free cash flow was a usage of cash and we paid approximately $100 million in dividends. We received $2.9 billion of cash from the transportation merger with Wabtec, other business dispositions and transfers netted to another $200 million. All other items were a usage of $1.5 billion of cash, which principally includes free cash flow and discontinued operations for transportation up to the close of the transaction, cash transferred with the disposition and change in debt.","In line with our ongoing goal to reduce reliance on short-term funding, average short-term funding needs declined from $17 billion in the first quarter of 2018 to about $4 billion in the first quarter of 2019, which were funded with commercial paper and some utilization of our revolving credit facility. We will continue to fund intra-quarter liquidity needs with a mix of commercial paper credit facilities and excess cash at GE Capital. As stated, our goal is to get to about $5 billion of short-term intra-quarter funding needs while we execute our de-leveraging plan, but we do expect some potentially significant fluctuation in intra-quarter short-term borrowing levels in subsequent 2019 quarters based on disposition timing and we have planned our credit facilities accordingly. At the end of the quarter, commercial paper outstanding was $3 billion and we had access to approximately $35 billion of committed revolving credit facilities with zero drawn. As planned and related to the completion of our first quarter disposition, the line stepped down from $40 billion in the fourth quarter.","Next on Power, we saw better-than-expected results this quarter largely due to timing. While we have a lot of work to do, we\u2019re making progress and the business is in the early days of its turnaround. Orders of $4.8 billion were down 14% on a reported basis, but up 14% organically. Power Portfolio orders were up 4% organically, Gas Power orders were up 24% with equipment up 95% and services up 8%. We booked about 4.5 gigawatts of heavy duty gas turbine orders for 11 gas turbines, including 3 Hs and these orders were accretive to our backlog margins and are in geographies that present lower execution risk. This was a strong orders quarter on the equipment front, but as we said before, this business has variability and some of the orders that were booked this quarter were anticipated to close later in the year. We are still planning for the new gas unit market to stabilize at 25 gigawatts to 30 gigawatts per year.","Overall, Power backlog closed at $93 billion, up $1 billion versus the prior quarter, but down 3% year-on-year with equipment of $25 billion, down 4% and services of $68 billion, down 3%. Gas Power represents $70 billion of total Power segment backlog. Power revenues of $5.7 billion were down 22% reported and down 4% organically. Power Portfolio revenue was down 4% organically and Gas Power revenue was down 5%, which was slightly better performance than our expectation. We shipped 7 gas turbines in the quarter versus 12 in the first quarter of last year. Gas Power services revenue was down 5% due in large part to the outage mix this quarter.","Segment margins were 1.4% in the quarter and operating profit was $80 million, down 71% largely due to the impact of dispositions and volume. While it is early in the power turnaround, this was a positive start to the year, with outperformance principally driven by timing. We have no change to our outlook for the year, but we expect variability from quarter to quarter in Power. Scott, Russell and the teams are making progress on our initiatives to improve commercial and operational performance in to our cost position.","Moving to Renewable Energy, the quarter came in lower than our expectation, but we had planned for light first quarter shipments in our double-digit growth profile. Orders of $2.4 billion were up 1% reported and up 3% organically. Onshore wind orders were flat reported and we received our first order for the new onshore Cypress product, which will be installed in Germany later this year. GE is the only supplier with an operating prototype greater than 5 megawatts. Pricing came in at negative 1% in the quarter, compared to negative 8% in 2018. We\u2019re seeing price declines continue to moderate as the industry ramps up for U.S. PTC driven orders this year and next in international markets normalizing after moving from feed in tariffs to auction.","Revenues of $1.6 billion were down 3% reported and up 3% organically, onshore wind sales were up 11% reported mainly driven by equipment. Segment margins were negative 10% reported with an operating loss of $162 million, down approximately $240 million versus prior year. The decline was driven by a combination of legacy matters, including the Alstom JV consolidation, project issues and contract termination, as well as R&D investments related to the Haliade-X and Cypress platforms.","Operationally, the negative pricing was more than offset by cost productivity and volume. Renewables faces a steep production ramp, which is a challenge but Jerome and his team have solid plans in place to deliver the volume. We expect to more than double deliveries of wind turbines and re-powering kit sequentially in the second quarter and further ramp deliveries in the third and fourth quarters. This volume mix, and leverage improvement should put renewables on track for the full year guidance of strong double-digit revenue organic growth in margins around zero in 2019.","Next on Aviation, which had a strong start to the year, orders of $8.7 billion were up 7% reported and organically. Equipment orders grew 3% driven by commercial engines up 12% on strength in the GE90 and 9X. LEAP orders were down 20% versus prior year, but up versus expectations. We received orders for 636 LEAP engines in the quarter for both the Boeing and Airbus airframes. Service orders grew 10%, revenues of $8 billion were up 12% reported and organically. Equipment revenue grew 23% on higher commercial engines. We shipped 424 LEAP engines this quarter versus 186 in the first quarter of 2018 and we finished the first quarter on schedule with Airbus and 2 weeks behind schedule with Boeing. But we expect to be back on schedule in the second quarter. CFM56 engine shipments were down 50%, services revenues grew 6% with the spares rate up 21% driven by higher aircraft utilization. Segment margins of 20.9% contracted by 160 basis points reported in the quarter versus the prior year, and we experienced continued aftermarket strength and flat company funded R&D as more of the cost transitions to external funding, primarily in our military business.","As we shared at the outlook call, total engineering effort comprising both company and customer funded spending continues to grow in line with top line growth. And this was more than offset by two margin drags, the CFM to LEAP transition, which was 310 basis points and the Passport engine shipments, which were 60 basis points. Operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% reported and 3% organically and higher volume and improved price partially offset by negative mix. We are on track to deliver high-single digit revenue growth and segment margins of approximately 20% in 2019.","Looking at healthcare, orders of $4.9 billion were up 4% reported and 10% organically driven by equipment orders, up 13% organically and services up 5%. On a product line basis, healthcare systems orders were up 5% organically. This was driven by imaging growth of 7% due to strong growth in premium and performance CT and new product introductions in MR including our AIR coil technology as well as life care solutions up 6% due to continued momentum on solutions-oriented deal. Life sciences orders were up 22% organically with BioPharma up 31%. Revenues of $4.1 billion were flat reported and up 4% organically. Healthcare Systems revenue was up 1% organically on tougher prior year comps, particularly in imaging, life sciences was up 5% organically driven by BioPharma up 20% and Pharmaceutical Diagnostics up 7%. Segment margins were 16.7%, expanding 110 basis points on a reported basis. Operating profit of $781 million was up 6% on a reported basis and 15% organically, which excludes the sale of value-based care business. Organic profit growth was driven by volume and cost productivity, partially offset by inflation, price and program investment. Healthcare is on track to deliver its 2019 outlook, which includes BioPharma of mid single-digit organic revenue growth and margin expansion.","Moving on to Oil & Gas, Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning and Lorenzo and Brian will hold their earnings call with investors today following ours. Regarding GE Capital, continuing operations generated net income of $135 million in the quarter, which is favorable versus prior year. This was primarily due to lower excess interest costs including the non-repeat of asset and liability management actions, the U.S. tax law change and prior year U.S. tax reform impact, higher gains and lower impairments. We ended the quarter with $107 billion of assets excluding liquidity down $2 billion from year-end, primarily driven by industrial finance. We completed the sale of the GE Capital supply chain financing program to MUFG and GE suppliers will start to transition to MUFG in the second quarter.","GE Capital completed asset reductions of $1 billion in the first quarter. It is on track to execute $10 billion of asset reductions in 2019 to meet the $25 billion target. Capital finished the quarter with $15 billion of liquidity, which was flat to the fourth quarter and $63 billion of debt, which was down by $2 billion, primarily driven by debt maturities. In the first quarter, we continue to de-risk GE Capital by finalizing the WMC settlement with the Department of Justice, making the $1.5 billion payment in April, which was in line with our reserve. WMC filed for bankruptcy on April 23 and intends to file a Chapter 11 plan to complete an efficient and orderly resolution. We also contributed $1.9 billion for the insurance staff funding as planned and as discussed during the Investor teach-in and consistent with the permitted practice as we have previously discussed, we expect to fund an additional $9 billion through 2024. Our strategy at GE Capital will continue to focus on shrinking the balance sheet and achieving asset reductions of $25 billion by the end of 2019 and less than four times debt to equity ratio by 2020. As we said before, we still plan to contribute $4 billion to GE Capital in 2019.","As we look out to the second quarter, we expect lower earnings from GE Capital, driven by the semi-annual preferred dividend payment and non-repeat impact of the tax law change and lower asset sale gains. Consistent with our outlook call, we anticipate that GE Capital would generate a continuing net loss of $500 million to $800 million in 2019. But we expect to break-even by 2021. At corporate, we continue to drive decision making back into the businesses and this cultural shift is starting to take hold. We believe these decentralized functions are ultimately run more efficiently and with greater accountability when decisions are made at the businesses. We continue to both reduce expenses and transfer activities to the segments while fundamentally refocusing corporate on tasks that support and enable the businesses.","Our starting point for total corporate managed headcount in mid 2018 was about 26,000. Today that number stands at about 13,000 and we still have a long way to go. More than two-thirds of that reduction to date has come from internal transfers to the businesses where you will see most of the benefit and the remainder from outsourcing, restructuring, and attrition. The bottom line is that, we have exited about 1,000 corporate headcount with real cost out to date, most of which is reflected in the segment results. As we\u2019ve said before, it\u2019s a start, recall that our goal is to drive corporate costs below $700 million in 2021 compared to our 2018 spend of $1.2 billion. We would expect the businesses to drive further opportunity as they are now accountable for most of these positions. In the first quarter adjusted operating costs were $343 million roughly flat on a sequential basis and we are on track for our full year outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.","Larry Culp","Jamie thanks. You will recall that most of Slide 9 was what we have shared with you back on March 14 during our outlook call. We stand by our full year guidance and as we have discussed much of our first quarter performance had to do with timing. The only new news on this slide is the addition of the 737 MAX and the key variable, which we are monitoring closely. Our industrial businesses have strong fundamentals, which gives me confidence that we can make them better cash generators. We expect free cash flow to return to positive territory next year and accelerate thereafter in 2021 as the headwinds diminish and our operational improvements yield results. Longer term, as I have said previously, from an aspirational perspective, we should see the opportunity over time for our free cash flow margins to be at least double the mid-single digit rate that we saw in 2018. While 2019 is a reset, it will be one of intensity, focus and transparency with all of you. We are committed to creating value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders. Thanks for your continued interest in GE.","With that, we will open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And from Barclays we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell","Thanks. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning Julian.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Maybe just a first question around industrial margins, you have got the guidance for them to grow slightly in 2019. In Q1, they are obviously down a fair amount, so maybe give us some update as to how quickly you dig out from that down 160 bps? When do we start to see the margins expand year-on-year?","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Julian. So, we planned for margin contraction in the first quarter and that\u2019s really been a combination of volume and cost productivity that over the course of the year will drive margin accretion. We saw declines in Power and Aviation and renewables, but for the rest of the year we have got renewables with a significant volume ramp with positive margin. We have got Power with non-repeat charges or at least charges not at the same level in the second half, which really impacted margins last year and healthcare, we see continued growth and those things really offset the Aviation mix headwinds. And as we look at it, this does ramp through the year more in the second half, but we believe we are on track for the OMX expansion for the year.","Julian Mitchell","Thank you very much. And then my second question, just around the industrial free cash flow. Appreciate the detail around the timing and how that swings around on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but just to clarify, if I look at the working capital plus contract assets outflow, in aggregate that was I think $2.5 billion in Q1. Is it fair to say that, that was the maximum outflow from those items we should expect on a quarterly basis this year or is there some risk that because of lumpiness or what have you there could be a larger outflow at some point in the next three quarters?","Jamie Miller","If you look at this quarter compared to our total year plan, I would say the answer to that is yes, this is a very high impact quarter for both. Having said that, when you look at industrial free cash flow this quarter it was significantly better than we expected, but as we mentioned in our comments, that was largely due to timing. And when you look at the causes of some of that timing shifting with progress in aviation \u2013 I am sorry, Power and Aviation orders which in Power drove higher progress collections and you saw better underlying collections in services and lower project disbursements in Power as well. And you also saw some timing with respect to customer payments at Aviation accrued discounts. So when you look at that in totality that was most of the timing impact in the quarter. We do expect that to largely balance out over the rest of the year. So, you will see that shifting.","Operator","From Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Hi, good morning.","Jamie Miller","Going morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Davis","I wanted to backup Larry a little bit, because there is not a ton new here versus your outlook call just a month ago, but what\u2019s your sense now, you have had a chance to visit factories each of the different businesses. I mean, is there any \u2013 are there seeds of lean and daily management and best practices at all that you can build on or you have to start from scratch?","Larry Culp","Scott, I have been out a good bit here of late. It\u2019s the beauty of being on the other side of outlook get to spend more time with the businesses. Seeds, is probably the right way to frame it. Somebody shared with me as I have been poking around here a little bit that lean in certain quarters has been a four-letter word over time. But as I have seen a number of our facilities, what I have been very impressed by is some of the legacy lean expertise around 5S, around good flow within a line or a sell and frankly within a facility. But there is a lot of opportunity inside of those four walls, particularly with respect to how we integrate more broadly outside of any one site with our vendors and with our other facilities in any one of our segments. So in fact, I am going to have a number of our lean leaders in for half day on Wednesday of this week to really go through a little bit more to history, understand, get their perspective on what needs to be different this time around to really drive an approach here that teaches, motivates, but ultimately not only drives results, but informs a culture. And we certainly have I think the business imperatives with respect to cash and as importantly, quality and delivery for our customers to get us motivated to get after this. So, the seeds are there. We just need to water them and nurture them. And I think you will see over time and our customers will see over time real impact. But as you know, none of that really happens overnight, that in itself is a journey, but one we are going to be on here shortly.","Scott Davis","And just on that topic, really Larry, I mean, if you are a GE employee, you have gotten kicked around pretty hard the last couple of years, I mean, is there a sense of kind of a stability and excitement, are people still shopping their resumes and trying to get the hell out of there or what\u2019s your sense of really the stability on the people side of the organization?","Larry Culp","Scott, I suspect both dynamics are in play. Right, I get a chance to go down to Pensacola, one of our key renewable facilities here in the U.S. sent a little note out to the organization in terms of what I saw. The response I got was really encouraging in terms of just how many people appreciated not only the visit, but the observations and what it could mean more broadly, but we don\u2019t take anybody for granted, we know we still have to make sure our value proposition for our team is as robust as the one we try to craft for investors. So, that too is a work in process.","Operator","From Vertical Research, we have Jeff Sprague. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jamie Miller","Good morning Jeff.","Larry Culp","Hey, Jeff. Good morning.","Jeff Sprague","Good morning. Hey, just again kind of back to cash flow, if you thought about this simplistically right, you are through Q1, you are kind of at the midpoint of your cash flow estimate for the year. But I wonder if you are suggesting to us that, that Q2 cash flow was negative because of the timing issues that you are mentioning. And as part and parcel of that too, I was wondering why it would be that you would expect maybe some spike back up from this relatively low level of intra company revolver usage in this first quarter?","Jamie Miller","Hi, good morning, Jeff. So, with respect to free cash flow, when I was commenting on Julian\u2019s question, I talked about the timing element. The other piece that we expect to significantly shift throughout the year is restructuring MBD as well as the timing of our supply chain finance transition. So you have got timing reversals just in the core. You had really flat restructuring this quarter which we expect to ramp throughout the year to a much more significant level. We had no supply chain finance impact this quarter that really starts in second quarter and is really more of a second half loaded item. And then we have got some watch items too, I mean, I mentioned in my comments, renewables execution is certainly something we\u2019re watching and power just general variability in operations is something we\u2019re watching as well. So when you start to look at second quarter, yes, we do think second quarter will be negative, but when you really look at the cadence of these, I mean, this is obviously lumpy and from a timing perspective, we expect most of that difference that you saw to reverse throughout the year. But and then you asked a question about intra-quarter and why that might be shifting? From an intra-quarter perspective, a lot of this depends on the timing of disposition activity. So, in the first quarter, we had the Wabtec cash coming in February, which helped us in terms of normalizing that peak and that variability. And then as we look at the rest of the year, it will just depend on the timing of some of our sell downs and how that might relate to our plans.","Operator","And from JPMorgan, we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey guys, good morning.","Steve Winoker","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning Steve.","Steve Tusa","Thanks a lot for all the detail. The 10-Q is very helpful. Just a follow-up on Jeff\u2019s question, maybe a little bit of magnitude, I mean, I think in the prior kind of high level was a portion of the annual declines across the quarters, obviously first quarter didn\u2019t come out that way, should we kind of...","Larry Culp","It was actually hard. You broke up a little bit.","Jamie Miller","I think we heard you though. You were talking about magnitude, magnitude in the first quarter. Yes.","Steve Tusa","Yes, yes, the I think the high level we were just assuming was basically just cut up the annual prorated \u2013 you know, pro-rate those declines over the four quarters. You obviously came in better than that in the first quarter. When we kind of try and calibrate on the rest of the year, you know, should we still assume, OK, there is a prorated decline in the second quarter and then the second half is kind of more heavily loaded. Is that the right mindset at this stage of the game?","Jamie Miller","Yes, the way I would frame it is that, we still believe we\u2019re within the range of our guidance, so negative two to zero, one industrial free cash flow. As I said before, this is lumpy, but maybe a simple way to think about it is to think about the 2018 free cash flow, think about our guide and the difference between that, I\u2019d really think about may be spreading that over the next three quarters, maybe some simple math there.","Steve Tusa","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. And one last question, just on Aviation, do you guys, you talked about progress payments and timing. Is there anything that you guys are there any kind of contractual abilities to provide discounts to customers to maybe bringing cash a little bit earlier, your prepayment discounts, is that kind of standard industry practice for you guys at various times, either quarterly or over the course of the year that you can kind of time that cash flow?","Jamie Miller","From a discounting perspective, we do see discounting of both across both engines and services. And typically, when we contract on a deal, we will have differences in our contracts with both airframers and with the customers in terms of whether it\u2019s discounting or timing of cash flow. So, yes, that can vary.","Operator","And from Cowen & Company we have Gautam Khanna. Please go ahead.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, thank you. Just a follow-up on the last question, on the 737 MAX delivery hiatus, can you just talk a little bit about what that does in terms of quarterly cash burn for every quarter that that extends? What does that do in terms of receivables you can collect or your inventory that you have to build?","Larry Culp","Right, right. Well, I think our expo right, I think our exposure is as you frame it and obviously, we share that exposure with our joint venture partner Safran and they were talking the other day about a \u20ac200 million exposure in the second quarter if things stay as they are. And we probably have something in that same range as a headwind with respect to our own business, our own side of the JV in the second quarter. And part we can handle some of that, but again what we try to do is, make just make sure people understand no news obviously that, that\u2019s a fluid situation with some uncertainties while we have given ourselves a little bit of room with the annual guide, none of us know for certain how that\u2019s going to play out and we, we just wanted to flag that accordingly.","Gautam Khanna","Understood. And just to follow up on that, if you could comment on, I know you guys are catching up, it sounds like in May with the underlying 52 a month rate on the 1B, LEAP-1B. If you could just talk about where you are on the cost curve of that program and when you expect to be at breakeven on the OE shipments and what the opportunity is to move beyond that, you know, profitable on the OE and when?","Jamie Miller","Yes. So, it\u2019s consistent with our view over the last year, which has been breakeven in 2021. We do expect it ranges depending on the LEAP-1A or LEAP-1B more than 10% cost out this year on the engine. And if you remember, since the end of \u201816 already we\u2019ve taken up more than 40%, so good path here, but break-even in 2021.","Operator","From RBC Capital, we have Deane Dray. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Larry Culp","Hey, Deane. Good morning.","Steve Winoker","Hey Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, Larry, you commented on the healthcare business, the RemainCo healthcare business, you\u2019ve got flexibility and optionality. Maybe give us an update there, we know the IPO is on hold, but could you share with us any updated thinking?","Larry Culp","Well, I mean, I would just say, we don\u2019t think of it as RemainCo, obviously the BioPharma business is a wonderful franchise and will be in what I believe to be good hands on the other side of the sale. But our go-forward healthcare business is an exceptionally strong franchise. I think you see that in the first quarter print, but I think more importantly, we sit really at the heart of precision health, that gives us organic optionality let alone inorganic optionality. As we get into our operating reviews, I\u2019m really encouraged by what I see both in terms of performance around our KPIs operationally and commercially, but frankly what Kieran and company are framing as some of our improvement potential, I\u2019ve been to two of their sites back to what Scott was poking at, frankly a lot of opportunity for lean in those businesses, particularly with respect to quality and delivery-oriented improvements. So, we\u2019re excited about that business as part of GE and we\u2019ll play it forward in the way that best serves our customers and shareholders. So, stay tuned.","Deane Dray","Got it. And then just a separate topic, and I\u2019m really not used to asking you about contingency in a forecast or guidance for the year, but we know there is contingency built in. You suggested in your remarks that the 737 has eaten into that a bit, but maybe you can frame for us, I\u2019m not sure how quantitative, but just qualitatively, where contingency is in terms of your framework for the year?","Larry Culp","Well, I think that we probably will refrain from trying to quantify the size of the contingency just to keep it as a contingency, right. But we\u2019re encouraged by the start of the year Deane on cash again, given that we\u2019ve got a fair bit of positive timing effects here, that will balance out. We can safely conclude our contingencies effectively in hand, a little bit of pressure here as I highlighted, given what we know here in the second quarter around MAX, we\u2019ll see how the second half plays out. We don\u2019t have all of that baked in, but we don\u2019t want to necessarily bring excuses forward, we want to deliver results, and that\u2019s the mindset that we\u2019ve got here.","Operator","And from Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning Nigel.","Larry Culp","Good morning.","Steve Winoker","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe","Yes. But I venture to maybe dial back the bit more detail on the Power Services performance during the quarter. I\u2019ll be particularly interested in how the transactional business is faring?","Larry Culp","Sure, Nigel. Let me give you a little bit of color there. I think if we look at orders, we were encouraged, though not satisfied, the order book was up slightly. Revenues were down and that was largely a function of mix. Good underlying volume, but frankly some of the higher price point outages were down year-on-year. Good bit of noise in the margins there, but when we when I look at it operationally, we were up slightly. So I think Scott and Company would say, some progress a long, a long way to go here both with respect to the top line and delivering on the improved pricing, we\u2019re seeing in that order book, right. It\u2019s one thing to write that order with better pricing, we need to execute on it, to see that really play out in the margins. But a decent start I\u2019d say to \u201819.","Nigel Coe","Okay, great. And then Larry, your comments on the free cash margin doubling. I think you said, more than double, obviously no timeline on that, but for most of the people buying your stock today have 3-year to 5-year horizon. How aspirational is that margin target, high single-digits margin, do you see that as I wouldn\u2019t say a line of sight, but do you think that\u2019s feasible target within a 3-year to 4-year time horizon?","Larry Culp","Well, I would say, Nigel, we put a 3-year time table on it, it would no longer be aspirational right. It would be a mid-term outlook. But I think I just see strong performance in a number of parts of the Company, but also the signs, the cash has not always been a priority. Part of what I think we\u2019re seeing in power and part of what we\u2019re working on elsewhere is to make sure that when we go cut deals to drive and fill the order book that we\u2019re thinking about the cash over the lifecycle of that order, right, because we want to get paid and we\u2019d like to get paid sooner rather than later. We\u2019ve talked a little bit about lean. I don\u2019t want to make this a teaching on lean, but there are a lot of opportunities to improve our free cash flow as that becomes more a part of our fabric. And that will have positive impact I think for customers as well as it will for us. When you get into the real flow in a supply chain, there are opportunities, particularly as we deal with our vendors and with each other in a more integrated pole-oriented way. I was at a facility recently talking about or asking about Kanban. Somebody said, what\u2019s that? You can take that two different ways. I took that as a good thing, that\u2019s an opportunity to drive more pull, more flow in the facilities. But first things first, right. We need to deliver on what we said back in March relative to this year. Nobody is proud of the fact that cash flow number, probably going to have parenthesis around it, but it is what it is, next year when you walk in with line of sight on positive free cash, and then a significant uptick in \u201821. So, I think for today we\u2019ll keep the aspirations aspirational and maybe with a little bit more progress we can dial that in a little bit more tightly.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Hey Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","Hey, so I\u2019m going to apologize because I was on another call, so if these have been answered or if you guys answered them in prepared remarks, I am sorry about that.","Larry Culp","Another call?","Nicole DeBlase","I know. I am sorry, it\u2019s such a busy day. So, the first question just around the renewables business, just margins came in a bit weaker than we had expected. I know this is a tough year for renewables, but if you could talk a little bit about like the trajectory from here if 1Q is reflective of the full year?","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Nicole. So renewables, we were encouraged by orders, we were encouraged by pricing really stabilizing, but they did have a tougher quarter, while megawatt volume was up 13% year-over-year, we did see some volume slippages in the quarter and pricing impact was small as we talked about, but we had strong product cost control, which was really good. Our challenge here is that, we got a couple of things really impacting year-over-year and then we do expect margin accretion throughout the year, so year-over-year we have the impact from the consolidation of the Alstom JV. We had some project execution issues, some in offshore and hydro, we had a non-repeat from first quarter of \u201818 of some favorability. We also had an offshore contract termination that was favorable in the quarter. So net-net that was a negative. We have higher R&D, higher depreciation and China tariffs that are affecting us operationally and we\u2019ve got lower PPA amortization or purchase price amortization. So, year-over-year, you see that impacting our margin. Having said that, we have got a very steep volume ramp as we talked about this year, so for the year, more than doubling in the second quarter with an even more significant ramp in the third and fourth quarter, good margin backlog, so that\u2019s good. You will still see R&D being up 9% year-over-year and I think you\u2019ll see more moderation in how we\u2019re managing our legacy projects, some of this noise is us just continuing to burn off some of that order book in renewables. So, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color.","Nigel Coe","Yes, that\u2019s super helpful Jamie, thanks. And then kind of a similar question on capital, a little bit better in the first quarter, what drove that relative to the guidance for $500 million to $800 million loss in the full year and I guess what\u2019s the cadence from here throughout the rest of \u201819?","Jamie Miller","Yes, so capital did come in well above plan. And a couple of bigger items that drove that, which were lumpy. First is the impact of the tax law change in the quarter was about $100 million. The second, we did have asset sales in GECAS totaling $86 million of gain and both of those I would characterize as either one-off or timing in terms of just when they might occur. We sold the supply chain finance business to MUFG as well in the quarter that was $25 million and we had some other capital corporate favorability. But bottom line is when you look at the cadence, so first of all, this was an unusually high quarter for us. We do continue to expect the negative $500 million to negative $800 million for the year. Remember that our preferred dividend hits us in the second quarter and in the fourth quarter, so that\u2019s a sizable negative. And then we will have other asset sale impacts throughout the year, which again are going to be lumpy.","Operator","From Citi, we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey good morning guys.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Andrew, good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Larry, just focusing on the $3 billion gas power equipment business, you mentioned in the 2019 outlook call that, that was one of your key focus areas for improvement in terms of profitability and today you mentioned that the 4.5 gigawatts of orders were at higher margin and lower risk. Can you give us some more color on what lower risk means and do you think any of the improvement in orders was actually the result of a better US market?","Larry Culp","Well, I think that all of that comes together right to see the 3H orders that we got in the first quarter, we got a couple more here in April really suggest the U.S. market, which we thought would be better than I think some allowed, came in at the start of the year better than we had anticipated. Looks like our share position will be somewhere in the 40% range when that comes out, so I think by and large, again we don\u2019t want to get too excited those words we were aiming to get, we just got them earlier, but that\u2019s all good and because it\u2019s a U.S. based order book on balance that is part of what we\u2019re referring to in terms of the risk. But I just want to highlight that in the order structure that we put in place in gas power where we\u2019re running at less, we\u2019re running with if you will, less borders within the business, the regions really are more integrated. And we\u2019re trying to drive process, so that we are more mindful about the margin and the degree of difficulty, which translates into risk around any of these projects, whether they\u2019re close to Schenectady or a long way from home. So that too is not something that happens overnight, but I think given what we\u2019ve seen here at the beginning of the year we\u2019re encouraged by that. And as we go through our monthly operating reviews with Scott and the team, we get into some of the process improvements, the lean activity both with respect to how we write these deals and execute on the projects, let alone the service side with the outages, I think you\u2019ll see better execution over time.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And Larry, related to that, you have obviously been trying to fix your execution issues in power. So, while we know a lot of the cash performance was timing related, did your execution related power cash drag begin to improve and what\u2019s the probability that power cash flow is actually not worse than the $2.7 billion outflow in \u201818?","Larry Culp","Well, I\u2019m not sure we would really point to too many high impact material process improvements in terms of capital or at least working capital at this point. But that said, there is a lot that we still want to do from a restructuring perspective. I think that\u2019s why despite their start of the year, which was far better than we had anticipated, we\u2019re hanging on the full-year guidance because we want to make sure we not only give ourselves the latitude to do all that we can to adjust the cost structure here, I don\u2019t want anyone to think that this is a risk free segment for us at this point, because we got off to a good start in a few places.","Jamie Miller","And I would say we\u2019re monitoring things operationally. I mean I mentioned before that we do expect continued variability in power throughout the year. In the quarter, free cash flow for power was negative, it was significantly better than we expected, but for the year, we continue to expect it to be significantly negative. So hopefully that\u2019s a little color.","Operator","From Bank of America, we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Yes, good morning. Can you hear me?","Larry Culp","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","I have just a question, just a follow-up on Power orders, we\u2019ve been tracking U.S. utilities CapEx and it seems to be going up and I was thinking a lot of it had to do with pipeline, frankly. But are you seeing any positive trends on maintenance as well as you talk to your customers?","Larry Culp","I\u2019m sorry, Andrew on...","Andrew Obin","Utility, U.S. utilities CapEx, just trending positively, beyond orders for new gas power, are you seeing more spending on maintenance out of the U.S. utilities.","Larry Culp","I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019ve seen anything material in terms of the underlying budget scopes that we see on balance with our domestic customers. For us, it\u2019s really about execution on the CS side CSA side of a service book and just executing better as we alluded to earlier on a transaction side, not only in terms of our customer outreach, visibility still I think south of 90% today, getting a little bit better each quarter, let alone our share. I know that\u2019s a high priority for Scott, as he walks into the second quarter.","Andrew Obin","And just a follow-up question, so I think Kevin Cox has been there now all of like maybe a month and a half, but what structural changes are you, if any, are you implementing under him, any new approaches, how you manage people inside the Company? Thank you.","Larry Culp","Kevin will be thrilled to know that you were asking about this. For those that don\u2019t know Kevin, Kevin Cox is our new Senior Vice President for Human Resources direct report to me. Kevin, top HR Executive in his field came to us from American Express, grew up at Pepsi, seen a lot of change, seen a lot of challenge, we\u2019re thrilled to have him. He is still I think inside his 100-day tour of the Company. So, what we try to do with new people is give them as much time to get their bearings. So, it\u2019s Kevin hasn\u2019t laid out his answer to this question necessarily to the internal team, let alone the Board. He is on the June meeting docket. So, I\u2019ll just not get into too much detail other than to allude to some of these cultural dynamics that, that we highlighted in our prepared remarks, right. There is a lot we can do in terms of our formal processes and systems to drive the cultural change that, that we aspire to. And one of the reasons I wanted Kevin here on this team is he has done that and is very keen to be a part of that here at GE. So, somebody we\u2019re excited to have on the team and we\u2019ll certainly make sure that as time progresses, we give investors exposure to Kevin in what we\u2019re doing on, if you will, the softer side of the transformation here.","Operator","And from Credit Suisse, we have John Walsh. Please go ahead.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning John.","John Walsh","So just a question here and a follow-up. So, I guess thinking about the margin progression here, talking about the second half being better, how much of that\u2019s really driven by your internal initiatives, whether it\u2019s restructuring in the Power HQ versus, you know, assuming we get a better macro here in the second half. And then as a follow-up to that, just, you talked about absolute pricing in renewables in the script, just wonder if you could give some color around absolute pricing in Power and Healthcare and the other parts of the portfolio?","Jamie Miller","So, in terms of margin projection and over the balance of the year, I would say, we look at that as all things that we see, we\u2019ve tried to set a very realistic plan based on things we see and can control. And in terms of the broader macro market, I mean, I\u2019ll let Larry comment on that, but roughly in line with where we see it today as how we planned.","Larry Culp","Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve made any macro call here with respect to the guide in March let alone the confirmation here today. If anything from a macro perspective, clearly, we\u2019ve got the PTC dynamic in renewables, but otherwise, we\u2019re really assuming more of a steady state in our served markets. Obviously, passenger miles, is a strong indicator for us in aviation, that looks good. Power is in its own cycle healthcare tends to be somewhat resilient as well. So, I really can\u2019t think of anything other than PTC in terms of sequential external lift that we\u2019re going to get.","Jamie Miller","Yes. And then just commenting on your pricing question, so pricing this quarter was flat across the company. We saw slight positives at Aviation, slight negatives as per usual at Healthcare. In Power, basically flat, Larry talked before about equipment orders in the quarter were margin accretive to backlog. In addition to the comments he made, I would also just add that the underwriting framework that has been implemented there, I think has been very helpful as well, more focus on risk-adjusted cash returns and margins no longer comping on share just a more balanced risk return framework there, but flat at Power and then we talked about renewables being slightly negative. We do see it moderating both as PTC demand is driving price moderation but also just as you\u2019re seeing more price stability in the non-U.S. auctions.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. Mr. Winoker, do you have any additional remarks?","Steve Winoker","I just want to thank everybody for joining us. I know we\u2019re over our time. If for whatever reason we didn\u2019t get to you in any case, the team and I will be available through the week to help further. Thanks everybody. See you next time.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect."],"10142":["General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q4 2017 Results Earnings Conference Call January 24, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Matt Cribbins - VP, Investor Communications","John Flannery - Chairman and CEO","Jamie Miller - SVP and CFO","Russell Stokes - President and CEO, GE Power","Analysts","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Steven Winoker - UBS","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Scott Davis - Melius Research","Gautam Khanna - Cowen and Company","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Robert McCarthy - Stifel","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the General Electric Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen only mode. My name is Ellen and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matt Cribbins","Good morning and welcome to today's webcast. I'm here with our Chairman and CEO John Flannery; CFO Jamie Miller; and GE Power CEO Russell Stokes. Before we start, I would like to remind you that the press release, presentation, and supplemental have been available since earlier today on our investor website at www.ge.com\/investor.","Please note some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","And now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John.","John Flannery","Thanks, Matt. Before I start in on the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to step back and review where we stand and the progress we've made in just a short time. You've heard a lot from us since I became CEO in August.","I recognize that the news we've shared in that time, specifically around Power and Insurance, has been tough. We are moving very quickly to tackle these issues and we are doing so in the context of running our businesses for the long-term.","Our responsibility is to reshape this company and ensure that GE matters as much in the next century as it has in the past one. And as I take stock today, I feel good about the progress we are making and especially good about the strength of our team. We have a long way to go, but the mission is clear and we are moving forward together as one team with a single purpose.","The backbone of our recovery is stronger execution. Back in November, we laid out a new vision for the future, the foundation of which was improved execution, an obsession with cash generation and capital allocation, a more focused digital and additive strategy, and a rapid reshaping of the portfolio to become a simpler, more nimble organization.","Today, I'm proud to report that this organization is responding and we are beginning to show progress against each of our key initiatives. The teams have stepped up and embraced the challenges.","And in this quarter, we are beginning to see the signs of what they can accomplish when called upon to pursue common goals and drive improvement. We have a lot to work on, but we also have a lot to work with. The team and I are as convinced as ever that the strength of our core businesses remains intact. We have valuable franchises with leadership positions in key global markets.","And we have a path ahead that will create the best outcomes for our customers, great opportunities for our team, and will create value for our shareholders through stronger execution and more disciplined operational performance.","As I said, the results this quarter demonstrate some of the early progress we are seeing across our key initiatives. In Healthcare, we introduced 26 new products in 2017, and we're especially proud of the new Senographe Pristina mammography system.","It's the industry's first patient-assisted mammography device and it's indicative of the kind of innovation and investments we are making to improve Healthcare and save lives. It is also resulted in significant market share gain and profit margin gain.","In Aviation, I am excited by the progress we are making in Additive. In the quarter, we announced the world's largest laser powder additive manufacturing machine. It will print in a build envelope of one meter cubed, which is suitable for jet engine structural components.","Our additive capabilities are truly game changing and we expect to increase the pace of additive utilization to drive higher margins and innovation across our businesses in 2018.","We shipped 119 units in the quarter and 294 in the year, while our backlog in the fourth quarter was up 44% from last year. Additive is positioned to break even in 2018 and we believe there is a tremendous potential here.","While the Power market remains challenging, we have made progress in rightsizing the organization, taking out $800 million of costs and rationalizing our manufacturing footprint.","We continue to see cost opportunities here and are laser-focused on achieving them in 2018. The team is up for the challenge and is focusing above all else on delivering for our customers.","At Baker Hughes, the team is demonstrating disciplined execution in successfully capturing synergies through the integration. And the business has a clear path for profit growth in 2018.","I am also pleased with Digital's performance in the fourth quarter as we refocused our strategy on our core markets. Predix-powered orders were up 41% and we did $1.4 billion for the year, up 150%. The team is driving customer outcomes with APM, OPM, and ServiceMax. We have only penetrated 8% of the installed base today, so there is a lot of opportunity here and we are aggressively going after it.","With respect to our key operating priorities, let's start with cash. Cash in the fourth quarter was significantly better than we planned, about $2.5 billion higher. About half of this was due to the timing of progress payments and the other half was a result of better execution.","As you recall from our discussion in November, cash has been our number one focus and also in the minds of our investors, given the weak performance we had through the first three quarters. The results this quarter reflect more discipline and execution. We are focused on improving our visibility, execution, and tenacity on cash.","It's a similar story on costs. We came into the year with a structural cost-out target of $1 billion. We raised that in the third quarter to $1.5 billion and we delivered a little higher than that, at $1.7 billion for the year. We have strong execution and discipline on costs.","We are targeting an additional $2 billion out in 2018. In addition to that, we are particularly focused on product costs, attacking cost of quality, reducing manufacturing overhead, and accelerating the implementation of additive design and manufacturing. We are confident that we will deliver on that goal.","The team is also highly active in working towards simplifying the portfolio. We currently have over 20 dispositions in active discussions and you will begin to see tangible results in the coming quarters.","We ended the year with $11 billion of GE Industrial cash. There is no change to the capital allocation plan previously communicated on November 13. We plan to increase our cash balance in 2018 and exit the year with $15-billion-plus of cash.","We will make a voluntary $6 billion debt-funded contribution to our principal pension plan. And we will maintain a disciplined financial policy targeting 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and A1\/P1 short-term ratings. We are on track to shrink the Board from 18 to 12, including 3 new directors. We expect to be in position to announce the new Board prior to the proxy statement.","So at the overall company level, we are intensely focused on operational rigor, cash and capital allocation, and deep cost reduction. Our first priority is running the Company well. As I mentioned last week, at the same time, we are reviewing the best structure of the Company to maximize the long-term potential of our businesses and deliver the best value for our customers and employees.","We have a team dedicated to considering all the details and looking at the options that will deliver the best value for our shareholders and the most attractive jobs for our employees.","The truly enduring strength of GE lies in our people. There will be a GE in the future, but it will look different than it does today. We will update you when the team has made further progress.","I am very pleased that we are beginning to show these tangible signs of progress, but I'm also cognizant this is only the beginning. 2018 is a critical year for us and we intend to continue demonstrating in the coming quarters that our new approach is working and the organization is changing.","With that, let me turn to the quarter. Clearly, 2017 was a challenging year for us and fourth quarter had a lot of moving pieces. We had significant charges in the quarter for insurance, tax reform, and planned portfolio moves. These charges totaled $1.49 of EPS. Excluding those charges, adjusted EPS was $1.05, at the low end of the EPS guide we gave you for the year.","Issues in the quarter were mostly localized to Power. The power market continues to be challenging. Power earnings were down 88% in the quarter, driven by the market, certain execution misses, and other charges.","This is an important franchise going through a difficult period. The team is working with amazing dedication and resilience and they have the support of the entire GE Company behind them. I've asked Russell to give you an update on the quarter and take you through our action plan on the business in a few minutes.","Strong results in Aviation and Healthcare continued in the fourth quarter and for the full year. In the fourth quarter, Aviation grew margins 40 basis points while shipping 202 LEAP engines. Healthcare grew revenue 6% and earnings 13%. These two businesses continue to be premier leadership franchises in their industries.","Cash in the quarter was $7.8 billion. We had strong performances in Aviation and Healthcare. And we reduced structural costs an additional $500 million in the fourth quarter, with good performance in Power and Corporate. 2017 is behind us and the team is focused on delivering in 2018.","With respect to orders, fourth-quarter orders totaled $35 billion, up 3% reported, but down 5% organically. Equipment and service orders were both down 5% organically. Jamie will walk you through the drivers by business. Overall, the decline in equipment orders was driven by Power and Renewables, partially offset by strength in Healthcare and Transportation.","Service orders were strong in Renewables, Aviation, and Healthcare, but were offset by softness in Power and Transportation. Backlog finished the year at $341 billion, up $13 billion versus last quarter.","And now I will walk you through some market highlights on the right. Power remains challenging. We expect the overall market for new gas orders in 2017 to be less than 35 gigawatts and we are planning for it to be down again next year.","Long term, gas is going to remain an important component of power generation. We have a valuable asset and generate one-third of the world's electricity.","The aviation industry continues to experience strong growth. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 7.7 year to date, with strong growth both domestically and internationally. Air freight volumes have been very strong as well, growing almost 10% October year to date. Load factors globally remain above 80%, demonstrating strength in the sector.","In Healthcare, the US markets and European markets are stable, seeing mid-single-digit growth in 2017. Emerging markets remain strong, with double-digit growth. Renewables onshore continues to see strong growth, but there is significant price pressure across the industry.","In the US we saw a slowdown in market activity pending the resolution of the tax bill, which was signed in December. The US market continues to be very healthy, but we expect to see pricing pressures as the impact of tax reform is digested in the wind tax equity markets.","Next, let me walk through revenue, margins, and costs. For the quarter, segment revenues were $32 billion, up 3% reported and down 6% organic. The difference was driven mainly by the impact of the Baker Hughes acquisition.","Power, Oil & Gas, and Transportation all had negative organic revenues on lower volumes. Renewables organic was up on continued re-power strength, and Healthcare saw broad strength as well. For the year, revenues were $116 billion, up 3% and flat organic.","Industrial margins were 11.2% in the quarter, down 560 basis points. You really have two camps here. Power and Oil & Gas margins were down sharply. Industrial margins were up 200 basis points collectively in the rest of the Company. Healthcare margins were up 130 basis points in the quarter and 70 basis points in the year.","In March of 2016, we presented a plan to grow margins 150 basis points to 18% over 3 years. The Healthcare team delivered on that a year early, hitting 18% in 2017 and will continue to grow margins in 2018. Aviation had an outstanding year on margins, increasing margins 100 basis points while delivering 459 LEAP engines.","As I mentioned earlier, we've made good progress on structural cost, taking out $500 million in the fourth quarter and $1.7 billion for the year. And we have good momentum going into 2018.","And now I will turn it over to Jamie.","Jamie Miller","Thanks, John. Before I start with consolidated results, I want to remind you of some of the changes to our reporting metrics in 2018 that we discussed in November.","First, on EPS, this is the last quarter that we report Industrial plus Verticals EPS. In addition to GAAP earnings, we will report an adjusted EPS number, which is total continuing operations excluding Industrial gains, restructuring, and non-operating pension expense. On cash, we will move to reporting free cash flow as opposed to CFOA.","And lastly, two changes related to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard. As of January 1, 2018, our contract asset balances will be adjusted to reflect the new standard, resulting in a lower asset balance and lower earnings going forward.","This doesn't change anything related to our cash balances or cash flows. We will provide restated 2016 and 2017 quarterly information on a basis consistent with the new accounting. We are still in the process of finalizing the newly restated financials and we will provide them to you shortly after we file the 10-K.","Related to the accounting standard change is also a move to reporting remaining performance obligations, or RPO. RPO is a new GAAP measure and we will report RPO in the first quarter once it is implemented.","Additionally, you may have noticed that our earnings press release has a new format. We believe it's more substantive and more easily digestible. We will continue to re-look at all of our communications formats and data that we provide to investors with the goal to continue to increase standardization and transparency. So you will likely see more changes as we move throughout 2018.","Next, on consolidated results, fourth-quarter revenues were $31.4 billion, down 5%. For the quarter, Industrial plus Verticals EPS was negative $1.23, down from $0.46 in fourth quarter 2016.","Included in the negative $1.23 was $1.49 of charges driven by the Insurance-related adjustments we discussed last week, the impacts of tax reform, and portfolio-related actions we are taking in Industrial. Excluding these items, Industrial plus Vertical EPS was $0.27 in the quarter, still down significantly year over year, driven principally by the Power segment.","Operating EPS was negative $1.11. This incorporates other continuing GE Capital activity, which I will cover more on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of negative $1.15 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS of negative $1.13 includes the results of discontinued operations.","Next on taxes, the GE Industrial tax rate was negative 576% in the quarter, reflecting a tax charge on a pre-tax loss. This includes charges in the quarter related to US tax reform. And excluding tax reform and Industrial gains, restructuring, and fourth-quarter other charges, our tax rate was negative 7% for the quarter and positive 15% for the year.","On the right side are the segment results. Industrial op profit was down 33%. The decline year over year was driven principally by Power and Oil & Gas and partially offset by Aviation, Healthcare, and Corporate, better year over year.","As John mentioned, we took another $500 million of structural cost-out in the quarter and I will cover the individual segment dynamics separately.","On the next page, our reported cash from operating activities was $7 billion in the quarter. That represents GE cash flow including 100% of Baker Hughes CFOA. We did not receive a dividend from GE Capital in the quarter and this is in line with our prior communications. And we don't expect to receive a dividend from GE Capital for the foreseeable future.","Our Industrial CFOA was $7.4 billion in the quarter, adjusted for $400 million of US principal pension plan funding and deal taxes. And this is down $800 million from the prior year. With Baker Hughes GE on a dividend basis and excluding the Baker Hughes GE CFOA, our Industrial CFOA was $7.8 billion.","For the year, our total Industrial CFOA adjusted for Baker Hughes GE was $9.7 billion. This came in above our full-year guidance of $7 billion, driven primarily by better-than-expected progress collections and contract asset performance.","The Aviation and Healthcare businesses turned in strong performances, and the cash performance of Power was in line with expectations.","On the right-hand side, I have some color on the components of cash activity in fourth quarter. First, working capital generated a total positive flow of $3.9 billion, principally driven by better inventory flows from higher shipments and higher-than-expected progress flows of about $700 million. This was partially offset by an increase in receivables, consistent with our sequentially higher sales in fourth quarter.","Contract assets were flat during the quarter on favorable cash inflows from lower CSA contract asset growth, offset by cash usage from growth in deferred inventory in Power and Renewables.","All other operating cash flow, including deferred taxes, was a $6 billion inflow, driven primarily by non-cash expenses such as held-for-sale charges, the impact of tax reform, and amortization of intangible assets. For the year, we generated $5.6 billion of free cash flow with an 81% conversion rate.","There is no change to our 2018 guidance of $6 billion to $7 billion of free cash flow. However, in 2018, we do expect the challenging power markets to continue and potentially be worse than we expected.","Additionally, the accelerated progress collections in the fourth quarter will present some headwinds to our free cash flow, particularly in the first quarter, which is always our lowest cash quarter.","We are planning for a negative free cash flow quarter in first quarter. We remain focused on our operating rigor and execution on cash, with compensation heavily tied to cash performance. And we are evaluating incremental restructuring at Power. We will update you on this as decisions are made.","Next is the cash balance walk for 2017. I am not going to go through all of this, but you can see the detail on the left-hand side of the page. Excluding Baker Hughes GE, we started the year with $8.4 billion of cash and ended at $11.2 billion. We are focused on improving the strength of our balance sheet with a disciplined capital allocation framework.","During the quarter, we executed $13 billion of new operating credit lines, which provide greater security and flexibility as we execute our transition throughout 2018. We expect to end 2018 with more than $15 billion of cash.","Before I cover the segments, I will go through the other items for the quarter. First, on Industrial restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.08 of charges. $0.05 of that was related to GE, excluding Oil & Gas, and was primarily driven by the cost-reduction actions we are taking at Corporate, Power, and Renewables.","We incurred an additional $0.03 related to our Oil & Gas segment, which represents our portion of Baker Hughes GE's restructuring, most of which was synergy-related.","Second, as we covered at our November 13 investor meeting, we are taking actions to focus the portfolio. We announced our intent to exit several businesses and some of these decisions have resulted in charges as we move the assets to held for sale.","We incurred a $0.10 charge related to Lighting and $0.06 related to 2 platform exits in Aviation. In addition to the held-for-sale impact, we recorded a $0.02 charge for an incremental goodwill impairment in power conversion. As we began our portfolio actions, it became clear that the value of power conversion could not support the remaining goodwill, which has now been fully written off.","As we disclosed last week, we incurred $0.91 of charges related to GE Capital's insurance business and related actions we are taking to shrink certain GE Capital businesses. We also recorded a $0.40 charge related to US tax reform. I will cover these items on the next two pages.","On the bottom right of the page, just given all the moving pieces, I will walk you through a reconciliation of EPS. You will remember that in October we provided full-year guidance of $1.05 to $1.10, which excluded Insurance and GE Capital-related actions. It excluded portfolio-related charges and also tax reform.","So starting at the top, we earned $0.77 of EPS through the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we reported Industrial plus Verticals EPS of negative $1.23. Adjusting for the items that were excluded from our guide -- $0.91 related to Insurance and GE Capital actions, $0.18 related to portfolio, and $0.40 related to tax reform -- our fourth-quarter adjusted EPS was $0.27. This results in a total-year adjusted EPS number of $1.05, at the low end of the range we provide.","As we mentioned last week, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $9.5 billion and an after-tax charge of $6.2 billion related to Insurance. The related statutory capital contributions will be approximately $15 billion, which will be funded over the next seven years. We estimate that our 2018 funding requirement will be approximately $3 billion.","At this point, we estimate the annual contributions from 2019 to 2024 to be approximately $2 billion. There was no impact to our ratings and we don't expect this to impact our 2018 capital allocation plan.","We are taking actions to make GE Capital more focused, including exiting most of Energy Financial Services and reducing the size of Industrial Finance. As a result, we recorded non-cash charges of $1.8 billion for impairments at EFS in the quarter.","We expect GE Capital continuing earnings in 2018 and 2019 to be about breakeven. That could be higher or lower depending on the timing of asset sales. And post the actions in 2020, we expect GE Capital earnings to be about $500 million as excess debt runs off. We also do not expect dividends for the foreseeable future from GE Capital.","GE Capital ended the year with $31 billion of cash and liquidity. We also expect to generate incremental cash of approximately $15 billion from planned asset reduction actions over the next two years.","And consequently don't expect to issue debt until 2020, which is a year later than previously communicated. These actions will provide sufficient liquidity to continue to fund the Insurance contributions.","I also want to note that we have been notified by the SEC that they are investigating the process leading to the insurance reserve increase and the fourth-quarter charge as well as GE's revenue recognition and controls for long-term service agreements. We are cooperating fully with the investigation, which is in very early stages.","Next, on US tax reform, since the Insurance call last week, the impact from US tax reform increased slightly to $3.5 billion from $3.4 billion as we finalized our review. The Industrial impact was $3.7 billion, partly offset by a benefit in GE Capital of $200 million.","Of the $3.5 billion charge, $1.2 billion relates to the transition tax on overseas earnings and $2.2 billion is driven by the revaluation of our deferred tax positions and the write-off of existing credits that will no longer be available for use under the new tax law.","We expect the cash impact related to the transition to be modest over the next several years, as existing tax attributes, both credits and losses, will largely offset the payments required.","Longer term, we expect our Industrial tax rate to be in the low to mid 20%s, excluding disposition taxes. This is higher than the rate we have experienced over the last few years due to the lower benefits from tax credit loss transactions compared to recent history. We expect our tax rate over the next couple of years to be in the mid to high teens. Overall, we think tax reform is a real positive for US companies.","On Power, I'll give you a quick overview of the quarter and then Russell will walk you through more detail in a few pages. Orders of $10.2 billion were down 25%, with equipment down 24% and services down 26%. Revenues of $9.4 billion were down 15%.","Op profit for the quarter was $260 million, which was significantly below prior year and below our expectations. We incurred charges for several items and had year-over-year headwinds that negatively impacted the segment versus fourth quarter of 2016 by about $850 million.","Adjusting for these items, the business was still well below expectations. Russell will take you through the market and volume dynamics as well as the operational and execution issues we experienced.","Next on Renewables, orders of $3.3 billion were down 2%. Onshore orders were $2.8 billion, down 10%, driven by equipment being down 19%. Offset partially by services, up 38%, reflecting the strong US re-powering market. US equipment orders were up 6%, offset by lower international orders.","In total, we booked orders for 1,165 turbines, which was down 2%. But with megawatts, it was up 2% at 2.8 gigawatts. This dynamic reflects significant price pressure in the quarter.","We've seen price pressure increase during the year due to a competitive US market and as the international markets have been gradually moving to using an auction bid process.","Revenues were $2.9 billion, up 15% reported and up 9% on an organic basis. Onshore wind was up 5%, with equipment down 26%, offset by strong re-powering service, which was up 3 times.","Operating profit was up 25% reported and 11% organically. This was driven by re-powering volume and cost-out, offset partially by continuing unfavorable price.","The Renewables markets remain very competitive, particularly in onshore wind. The onshore wind market continues to see strong megawatt growth, but pricing is a significant headwind. Pricing for the total year was down about 10%, mostly driven by onshore turbines.","The business is focused on cost-out across all product lines. For first quarter 2018, we expect op profit down significantly year over year, mainly driven by lower turbine shipments in the US and continuous price pressure in the market.","On Aviation, orders in the quarter totaled $8 billion, up 11%. Equipment orders grew 2%. Commercial engine orders were down 1% at $1.8 billion, and services orders grew 17% on higher commercial spares rate of $27.4 million a day, up 36%.","Revenues in the quarter were flat at $7.2 billion. Equipment revenues were down 6% on fewer legacy engine shipments, partially offset by higher LEAP engine shipments. Aviation shipped 202 LEAP engines this quarter, up 158 units versus last year. Services revenue grew 6% on higher commercial spares and military.","Operating profit of $1.8 billion was up 2%, driven by favorable service and military volume and mix, cost productivity, and value gap, partly offset by higher LEAP shipments. Operating margins expanded 40 basis points despite delivering a record number of LEAP engines in the quarter.","Aviation had another strong year, delivering 459 LEAP engines with improving cost positions and margin expansion of 100 basis points. The LEAP engine continues to perform to specifications for both reliability and performance.","In 2018, we expect continued solid RPK growth despite rising fuel costs and high-single-digit growth in GE CFM shop visits. We are on track to meet our delivery commitment of 1,200 LEAP engines in 2018 with a production volume of more than 2,000 engines by 2020.","Military is on track for mid-single-digit growth. The team is executing well on cost-out and is committed to holding margins flat despite the steep LEAP ramp.","Healthcare orders of $5.9 billion were up 9% versus last year. Geographically, organic orders were up 7% in the US, 7% in Europe, and emerging markets grew 11%, driven by China up by 9%, and the Middle East up by 35%.","On a product basis, Healthcare systems orders grew 9% on an organic basis, driven by ultrasound higher by 6% and imaging up 15%, with good performance in CT and mammography. Life Sciences grew 4% organically, driven by bioprocess up 2% and core imaging up 4%. For the year, Life Sciences orders grew 9% organically, with bioprocess up 12% and core imaging up 7%.","Revenues in the quarter of $5.4 billion grew 4% organically, with HCS higher by 4% and Life Sciences up 5%. Operating profit was up 13%, including a small gain on a disposition of a non-strategic operation in Healthcare Digital.","Excluding the gain, op profit grew 10% organically, driven by volume and productivity, partly offset by price and program investments. Margins expanded by 130 basis points reported.","The Healthcare business had a strong year in 2017. Underlying market dynamics are expected to be relatively similar in 2018, and the Healthcare team is invested in the right programs while improving operational rigor, which we expect to continue to drive strong results as we move throughout the year.","Next, on Oil & Gas, Baker Hughes GE released its financial results this morning at 6:45 a.m. And Lorenzo and his team will hold their earnings call with investors today at 9:30. Orders were $5.8 billion, up 73% reported and down 9% organically. On a combined pro forma basis, orders were down 2%.","Revenues were $5.8 billion, up 69% reported and down 13% organically. And on a pro forma basis, revenues were down 3%. Operating profit was $307 million, down 25% reported and down about 75% in our legacy Oil & Gas business.","This was primarily driven by the longer-cycle oilfield equipment and turbo machinery businesses. The business realized $81 million of synergies in the quarter and $119 million since the deal closed in mid-2017.","During the quarter, cash distributions from Baker Hughes GE totaled $433 million, including the share repurchases and the quarterly dividend of $129 million. Lorenzo and Brian will provide more details on their call today.","At Transportation, orders of $2.1 billion were up 56% on low comparisons. Equipment orders were $1.1 billion, which included orders for 358 total locomotives versus zero in fourth quarter 2016.","Mining orders were up 3 times from last year. Services orders of $1 billion were down 23%, primarily driven by the non-repeat of a large Class I mods order in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Revenues of $1 billion were down 20%, with equipment down 37% with locomotive volume down from 171 units to 79, partially offset by mining wheels up 3 times. Services revenue was down 3% or $16 million, driven by lower transactional volume. Op profit was down 40%, driven by locomotive volume, partially offset by mining volume and continued cost controls and restructuring.","In 2018, we expect locomotive shipments to be about 250 units, mostly driven by international deliveries. The team is continuing to operate the business with rigor and is actively engaged as we position for possible disposition.","On Current and Lighting, revenues for Current and Lighting were down 7%, with Current up 9% and the legacy Lighting business down 21%. Op profit was $50 million, up from $3 million last year.","Finally, I will cover GE Capital. On the page I provided both reported net income and adjusted net income. The adjusted net income column excludes the effects of the Insurance charges, the related EFS impairments, and tax reform. Since we covered those topics earlier, I will talk you through the adjusted column, which reflects the core operations of GE Capital.","The Verticals core earnings were $122 million in the quarter, down 74% from prior year, driven primarily by higher impairments in EFS and lower tax benefits and base earnings, partially offset by higher gains.","Other continuing operations generated $1 billion in earnings in the quarter, driven by $1.6 billion of tax benefits, partially offset by $297 million of excess interest expense, $123 million of HQ operating expenses and restructuring costs, and $184 million of preferred equity costs.","Discontinued operations generated earnings of $182 million, primarily driven by gains associated with the GE Capital exit plan. GE Capital ended the quarter with $157 billion of assets, including $31 billion of cash and short-term investments, largely in line with the third quarter.","Now I will hand it over to Russell to cover Power.","Russell Stokes","Thank you, Jamie. On November 13, I shared with you that we had a significant opportunity to improve the way we run the Power business. I spoke of fixing operating misses, the prioritization of cash performance, in line with a focus on income. And I outlined our return to driving a more holistic services capture of dollars per installed base versus pursuing upgrades and productivity in our contractual portfolio.","I am confident in what I said in November. And I will talk in more detail about what we are doing to move the business forward. But let me first walk you through the results for the fourth quarter and the impact on total year.","Starting with a view on orders, our orders in the quarter were down 25%. Equipment orders of $5.3 billion were down 24%, driven by GPS being down 63%, primarily on lower combined cycle turnkey scope.","In the quarter, gas turbine orders were up 1 unit at 24 versus 23 units in prior year, with the increase driven by nine H units versus eight in the prior year. Total-year gas turbine orders were 75 units, which is down 9 versus prior year.","Aero units were also lower, with 3 units ordered in the quarter versus 24 last year, with total-year units at 46, down 33 versus prior year.","In December, we noted that the market was softer than expected, with Mccoy comments indicating that the industry could be heading for the lowest gigawatt year since 2002. We announced a 12,000-person reduction and a commitment to right-size our global manufacturing footprint.","We believe that total gigawatts awarded will be even softer than we thought in December, coming in below 35 gigawatts in 2017. And still anticipate, though, roughly a 50% share of the market in 2017. We are working to accelerate additional restructuring efforts in 2018 to support a market that could be as low as 30 gigawatts.","Service orders were $4.9 billion, down 26% on lower AGP orders, which were down 59% at 24 units versus 58. This was partially offset by higher grid solution services, which was up 54%.","In the quarter, Power revenues were down 15%. Equipment revenues of $4.5 billion were down 15% on lower aero units. Aero unit shipments were 3 versus 31 last year, accounting for all of the decline. Total-year aero shipments were 40 versus 95 last year.","Aero units, particularly our fast-power TM units, are typically convertible within the quarter. These units serve customers in difficult geographies and usually require some form of financing arrangements. We have transactions in the pipeline we expect to close in the first half of the year, but we believe that the 2018 aero shipments will be in the 30- to 40-unit range.","We shipped 39 gas turbines in the quarter, 4 more than prior year, including eight H shipments versus nine last year. This would put total-year gas turbine shipments at 102, in line with our estimate of 100 to 105 unit range. In 2018, we expect shipments to be 60 to 70 units, with 15 H units in that count.","Services revenues were $4.9 billion, down 16% on lower CSAs and upgrades down 17%, and outages down 10%. AGPs in the quarter totaled 25 versus 62 last year. This puts our AGP shipments at 80 versus total year, at the lower end of the 80 to 85 range we provided in November. For 2018, we expect about 40 AGPs.","Op profit of $260 million was down 88% or $1.9 billion and significantly below our expectations. Let me walk the $1.9 billion decrease. As Jamie mentioned, there were about $850 million of charges, slow-moving and obsolete inventory in Power Services, Gas Power Systems, and Power Conversion accounted for a little bit less than half of the amount.","The remainder was primarily comprised of the non-repeat of favorable FX from fourth quarter of 2016, the absence of Water income, which was sold in 3Q 2017, a litigation settlement, and the bankruptcy of one of our distributors.","Market and volume contributed about $550 million of the year-over-year decline, primarily driven by aero unit shipments and the Power Services upgrade volume, as I just discussed.","The remaining $500 million of decline was related to execution and operations. There was about $450 million of cost overruns in our project business, primarily in GPS, Grid, and Power Conversion. The issues included liquidated damages, logistic cost, and unfavorable cost on turnkey products that were underwritten several years ago.","The remaining decline was driven by lower pricing, higher field costs, and an unfavorable mix in our transactional service business. But this was partially offset by better execution on base cost by roughly $230 million.","Our services transactional business, including Alstom, saw significant declines in margin in fourth quarter of 2017 versus prior year. These margin declines are consistent with what we've been experiencing throughout the year related to pricing and cost execution. And highlights the opportunity we have in improving our holistic focus on dollar per installed base entitlement.","Scott Strazik has been put in the role of Power Services' CEO. And he and the team are intensely focused on improving our outage penetration margin rate performance. I will provide more details on that on the next page.","As I mentioned earlier, for the year, the markets were softer than expected. Deals are taking longer to close and are very competitive. We are expecting the markets to be less than the 35 gigawatts in 2017 and we are preparing our restructuring plans for a market that could be as low as 30 gigawatts in 2018.","We are proud of the HA gas turbine technology. It is operating in line with performance guarantees. While we've had some issues related to commissioning at certain sites, we readily address them.","And have commenced working on supply chain and project organizations to address volume ramp issues and things considered normal learning curve process. We have 23 units installed and over 70,000 hours of experience, with all of the units performing to specifications and guarantees.","Next, I'd like to give you some visibility into the progress we are making in rewiring the Power business. Since taking the role, I'm encouraged by the continued support of our customers, who look to us to deliver outcomes that allow them to deliver for their customers.","I am absolutely committed to the operational excellence and disciplines required to deliver for them as well as our investors and want to reiterate how we are moving forward. Our first priority is reducing our structure and footprint.","In 2017, we took out $800 million in structural costs, with $230 million of cost-out in fourth quarter, achieved with a strict focus on our controllable cost pools. In addition, we reduced our manufacturing and repair footprint by 15 sites, in line with our stated goal of a 30% reduction by 2020.","We are well on track for the $1 billion of cost-out we previously committed for 2018 and are assessing further opportunities to align our cost structure for a softer market reality.","The need to interrogate all areas of our operations and drive meaningful results is very clear to me. This is why we created our operational excellence team with a group of cross-functional dedicated SPRINT teams working in war rooms and building digital scorecards as a single source of truth with critical Xs aligned to critical business-wide outcomes.","To accomplish this, we must continue to invest in our IT infrastructure. We started 2017 with 74 ERPs, reducing them by 10 during the year with a successful major implementation in our Greenville factory.","Still, this leaves us with 64 ERP systems and far too much system complexity, which is why we are focused on reducing the number of total ERPs by 80% by 2020, giving our employees more timely and accurate information to track and deliver critical business and customer outcomes.","In the quarter, these teams demonstrated progress in our cash generation disciplines, contributing to the favorable cash performance for the Company in the quarter. The leadership and focus on material management and collections performance, including past dues and project billings, allowed us to deliver on our working capital commitments despite lower-than-expected new orders.","We have established clear performance goals for the Power business and are executing clear plays to achieve them. For example, we believe that we can improve inventory turns by 2 times by 2020 from the current 4 turns we see in 2018, even in a lower volume world through a great focus on our material management processes, a commitment to lean, and the liquidation of existing finished goods. This requires a $1 billion reduction in our inventory balances in 2018 and the teams are already driving detailed plans by site to get there.","To improve margins, we launched SPRINT teams, focused on project execution with a laser-focus on attacking schedule and cost overruns. In 2017, our Grid business moved all schedules and cost into a centralized digital application.","We linked all execution and billing milestones to the ERP and ensured cross-functional teams were aligned with clarity of accountability and with the visibility to monitor progress or performance deviations. I am confident that we can inject these same capabilities into GPS in 2018.","We've launched dedicated team efforts on transactional services to increase our performance around holistic dollar per installed base penetration. In the fourth quarter, we conducted an outage blitz by region to identify and account for all outages on our technology that we were not yet tracking.","As a result, we improved our visibility into the outages in our transactional fleet, up from 28% in October to 70% today. We believe this highlights an entitlement opportunity that is $1 billion to $2 billion higher than our 2017 run rate. We have organized our commercial teams and compensation incentives to deliver on both the contractual and transactional portfolio.","We have identified additional leadership changes that we felt were necessary and have executed on those accordingly. The services leadership team is new with a more focused alignment. Our supply chain leader is new, reporting directly to me. And we are in the process of transitioning our leader in Gas Power Systems.","As I've said before, 2018 will be another challenging year. Renewables penetration will continue to increase and challenge the gas markets. But I fundamentally believe gas power will remain an important contributor to the energy mix going forward. We are privileged to have the world's largest installed base and our CSA utilization is performing as expected.","While we saw a sharp reduction in upgrades this year, driven by the IPP capacity markets, extended service intervals, and market overcapacity, we are improving our commercial intensity and execution in a transactional outage market, which we have under whelmed in the past.","As a power business, we are focused on the things we can control: reducing structure and manufacturing footprint; improving cash conversion; expanding product, project, and service margins; maximizing services dollars per installed base; and strengthening our leadership and culture. We have a challenging road ahead, but the challenges we face are fixable.","John Flannery","Things, Russell. I am going to wrap up with the 2018 framework. There's no change to our industrial EPS or free cash flow guidance. Capital earnings will be lower due to the portfolio actions we are taking. Aviation and Healthcare are well positioned to deliver in 2018. Power markets continue to be tough, but we will manage this tightly.","We are targeting free cash flow of $6 billion to $7 billion. Jamie mentioned we had some progress payments move into 2017. At the same time, we are focused on improving working capital and reducing CapEx. We are making progress on cost and cash. We are strengthening our balance sheet and ended the year with $11 billion of GE Industrial cash.","Russell and the team are focused on fixing Power and they have the support of the company behind them. Aviation and Healthcare had excellent performance in 2017 and are well positioned for 2018. We\u2019re running the businesses better and simplifying the portfolio.","So with that, Matt, I will turn it back over to you.","Matt Cribbins","Thanks, John. With that, let's open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","Hi, guys. Good morning. So I have two questions. First one, with the lower base and profit, there is a lot moving around here. I think the prior segment guide was in kind of the $13 billion to $14 billion range on segment profits. And I guess Power specifically was going to be down 25%. What are you looking for next year with regards to those two metrics?","And then as a follow-up, the contract asset guidance of negative $3 billion next year in free cash flow. Has that changed at all relative to what we've seen here in the fourth quarter and your approach to project selectivity?","Jamie Miller","So Steve, when you look at the 2018 segment outlook, we had laid that out for everyone back on November 13. Really, there is no change to how we are thinking about Industrial. So however you had thought about it before, the only thing to adjust really is how 2017 ended.","The second piece of that to think about is last week on the Insurance call, we talked about with the GE Capital actions GE Capital would be about breakeven next year. And that's the other thing to think about as you work through that.","Now on the contract assets piece, no change to how we thought about 2018. We still expect that to consume working capital of about $3 billion. Contract assets were roughly flat in the fourth quarter.","But that is something that while we are pleased to see that and we have implemented a number of different controls on that, we are not starting to see that really take hold yet. So we don't expect to see that goodness or that shift really start to flow in 2018 yet.","Steve Tusa","So then how are you guys maintaining guidance if GE Capital is a little lighter and your base performance in 4Q was obviously on a segment profit basis below where I think most of us were expecting it because of Power?","John Flannery","So Steve, on that one, just a couple of thoughts here. One: we did in the fall really leading up to November a very detailed review of the businesses, deep dive into the businesses, as I shared with you. And really came up with a number of different scenarios for each business.","And on the back of that work, that is how we indicated the range of $1 to $1.07. We thought that reflected the reality of the business franchises as well, but also allowed for some room for contingency in that context. So GE Capital and Power definitely put pressure on that model, but I'd say we also see strength in Aviation, strength in Healthcare, opportunity for more cost-out.","And then the last thing I would just say is you can count on us for transparency, obviously. But we have a team that's dedicated to working through the issues and solving our issues and not mailing all of them right back immediately to investors. So we feel comfortable we can deliver this range in \u201818.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","John Flannery","Morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","John or Jamie, can you give us more color about the cash dynamics you saw in the fourth quarter? What ultimately do you think your teams did differently to deliver the better execution on the cash in the quarter?","And can you talk about why progress collections were stronger than expected? Was it just timing? And does the fourth quarter's cash performance give you more confidence that you can deliver on your cash generation expectations in 2018 despite a weaker dollar business?","Jamie Miller","Sure, I will walk you through the pieces of the fourth-quarter cash flow and can comment on your questions as I go through it. So first, working capital helped us by about $3.9 billion in the quarter.","A good chunk of that was inventory, about $2.2 billion of inventory. We really saw strength across the board across the businesses as just fourth-quarter shipments were liquidated and things moved through.","On progress, a lot of that is billing and milestone payments. But we did see, as we mentioned earlier, some accelerated progress into the fourth quarter. Some timing that we didn't expect. That was about $1 billion.","When you look operationally in terms of receivables, we did see past dues drop by about 4 points. And the team has done very good work there. We saw some of that movement throughout the year, but a nice drop in fourth quarter. We expect that work to continue as we go into 2018.","And then on contract assets, I mentioned before that really the deferred was flat. Some of the controls that we're implementing are things like just really making sure that we are much tighter on our underwriting, not only how we think about the strike zone around returns, but importantly how the cash profile really looks on these contracts going out several years.","Look, when you look at why it was flat in the quarter, a lot of that had to do with lower shop costs coming through at Aviation, which really pulled through just less revenue and a little bit on timing of revenue and billing. So while we are not seeing the effect of these controls yet, we do expect to see this over the next couple of years.","Look, I'm happy with what we've done on inventory. I think the finished goods burn-down was really favorable. Good work on AR. But we have a lot more work to do and I think also a lot more opportunity here. Turns were flat for the year on inventory. And then on contract assets, I'm pleased with it. But again, more work to do here and expect to see more.","John Flannery","Andy, the other thing I would say here is just working the cash flow is 1,000 different variables. It requires a lot of visibility and a lot of execution, and that's really where we are investing our time and effort.","So it really involves everyone in the Company, from the front end, the terms, how we are interacting with customers, how we are performing on project execution, how we manage the inventory, how we do billing.","So we are just -- I had quite a good team in Healthcare running this process and it's just a highly mechanical deep dive into seeing the moving pieces, many, many moving pieces.","The other thing I would say, just for perspective. As I mentioned in the opening remarks that this is our number one focus. As we go into 2018 for our pay structure for the teams, our incentive structures for the team, as we said before, we had numerous incentives before. We have two in 2018. One of those is free cash flow. So the Company is focused and incentivized around cash flow.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, John,","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague","Hi, thanks. Just two things. First, just back to the 2018 guide. So if I'm just understanding what I heard correctly, relative to the November outlook, where on an adjusted basis you are expecting Industrial profit to be up 2% to 7%, it does seem like it's tough to get to your guidance on that, right?","So we take where we've exited 2017, mark it down $2 billion dollars or so for rev rec, and then grow that 2% to 7%. Doesn't seem like it gets you there. It seems like there's something below the line. I don't know what I am missing. Maybe you could give us a little color on what you actually think Industrial segment profit is going to be in 2018.","Jamie Miller","Yes, Jeff, the thing I would probably point you to is that Power in the fourth quarter had a very tough quarter. And when you look at where we thought 2017 would land versus where it did, it was substantially lower there.","Now, when you really deconstruct the fourth quarter for Power, there were really two or three main themes there. One of which is just sort of one-time adjustments and some non-repeat items. Another was the impact of market, as we saw aero units and AGPs lower than we expected.","Another was really around operations and execution. And as Russell and the team have come in, first, the one-time items piece of it, which is about $850 million, about half of that was a charge for slow-moving and obsolete inventory that we took. We obviously don't expect that to repeat as we get into next year. The other piece of that $850 million was non-repeats from 2016.","The market piece of it, we saw a tough market in the third and fourth quarter across both the aero business and AGPs. Now, we do expect that to levelize a bit more as we get into 2018 back up. We saw a second half here down.","And then on the operations and execution, and Russell can give more color on both of these. Project cost overruns in PowerGen, Grid, and a little bit in Power Conversion. And then the transactional services piece of it, just with higher field costs and an unfavorable mix.","Now second half of the year in 2017 was tougher on services. On all of these areas, I mean, Russell is putting some very important stabilization activity in place. And we expect to see that Power stabilize a bit more and be above 2017 as we get into the year.","But Russell, maybe you want to give some color on that.","Russell Stokes","That's right, Jamie. I mean, the market dynamic within the quarter was $550 million. Lower aero units at 3 and 17 versus 31 in fourth quarter of 2016. We had lower services upgrades, so that came in at 25 versus 62, down 37. And then there was softness in the market related to Power Conversion that we have been navigating throughout the year.","Jamie is right. On execution, we continue to just do everything we need to run the business better. We dove deeply into projects and we are working through cost overruns and adjustments that we needed to take in those projects, as we were nearing the conclusion of a number of legacy contracts. Truing up costs with partners on deals that were underwritten back in the 2013, 2014, 2015 timeframe.","Had critical milestones that we were able to hit. They gave us better confidence around what those real estimates are going to be. And feel that we can navigate through that better as we go forward with some of the disciplines and controls we are putting in place.","Jamie talked about the transactional services element that was in there. So it continued to be softer than what we would like. But I mentioned that Scott and the team have done a really nice job of going out, looking at the field, finding all of our installed assets, and working to understand the outages associated with those assets in the field.","Back in October, we had visibility to only 28% of those outages. We actually can see 70% of those now, which is why we think that versus the 2017 run rate, there is a $1 billion, $2 billion opportunity for us to be able to go chase. And even with those pressures, we did have good cost performance at $230 million of favorable cost in the quarter.","Jamie Miller","You know, Jeff, one other thing I would just clarify. Just to be clear, what you had modeled for 2018 is probably roughly similar to what you ought to be modeling now. The thing that changed was 2017, not the 2018 element of the November 13.","John Flannery","And Jeff, one other thing I would add. Again, we ran obviously a number of scenarios for each business. I would just point out, again -- I will talk about Power in a second. But very strong outlooks in Healthcare and Aviation. Those businesses are really performing well.","And I would say when you look at Power, it's obviously the focus point of this whole discussion. This is a very important franchise. It's going through a very difficult period, but we still have a strong franchise here.","We have 50% share in the high-end technology. We have got a large installed base; a third of the world's electricity. So there is plenty to work with. It's clearly the new unit market is soft.","But as we look -- all the analyses we do show a 0 to 2% ongoing growth in the coming decades for electricity from gas power. So there's opportunity in this business in the franchise itself.","And as Russell laid out, there is basically four things to do to get that on track in terms of rightsizing the manufacturing footprint, working the cash and the inventory and the project execution, maximize the value of that installed base, as he walked through. That is still a very valuable asset.","And then lastly, improving really the management capability and bandwidth and processes. And Russell is all over that. We have made obviously a lot of changes in the management structure of that business.","So it\u2019s a lot of work. We said \u201817 issues would carry into \u201818 in Power. But it is still a good franchise and an important business and we\u2019re going to make the most of that.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with UBS.","Steven Winoker","Thanks. Good morning, all. John and Jamie, could you maybe frame -- help us frame the downside a little bit here? On the liability side and reserving, maybe just what do you do on WMC in the quarter?","How do you see changes there or in some of the other disclosed liabilities that we've seen quarter by quarter? And just give assistance for that level of reserving that you are operating and kind of the window of sensitivities around it.","Jamie Miller","So Steve, I will talk you through GE Capital and just WMC and other things we monitor there. We've got WMC and we have got some other trailing obligations around GE Capital, some of which are litigation-related, some of which are just indemnities from the assets we sold.","Ex-WMC, we hold reserves on that of about $700 million. That will play out over the next year or two. I think that those reserves are in the right place. When you look at WMC itself, there is a couple of components here. One is the reps and warranties lawsuits that we've disclosed in the past. We think we are fully reserved there at $400 million.","The FIRREA investigation that's being conducted by the DOJ, that was also -- I think we got pretty good disclosure out there on that as well. We have not yet had substantive discussions with the Justice Department. We are early in the process there, so I really don't want to speculate on that one.","Steven Winoker","And you didn't raise that out all in the quarter? The reserves?","Jamie Miller","No, we didn't.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Hi, guys. Good morning.","John Flannery","Morning.","Jamie Miller","Morning, Andrew.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Just a question in terms of the impact of oil price on your business. And I think the question is twofold. I would've expected sort of better Water dynamic at Baker Hughes. But then also looking at your exposure to energy-rich regions, what does that do for your ability to collect better in 2018?","Jamie Miller","So first on Baker Hughes, they have a call at 9:30 where Lorenzo and Brian will take you through that. When you look at the oil-rich regions, I'd say a couple of things from a finance perspective.","One is we did see some order uptick across some of our businesses in those regions in the fourth quarter. In terms of the ability to collect and really work through some of the other more operational issues, I think this can be a favorable thing for us in \u201818.","In Oil & Gas in particular, it's really a longer-cycle business here. So when you think about the recovery, while we are starting to see some activity in oilfield services, turbo machinery solutions, things like that over time should benefit.","Andrew Obin","Just a follow-up if I can. What about divestitures? How does that figure in your EPS outlook?","Jamie Miller","When you look at the divestitures -- so we moved some of those to held for sale this quarter. We have got about -- well, we've got a handful of business and product sales, smaller ones, that are in the process right now. The value and proceeds estimate on that right now is in the $4 billion to $5 billion range based on today.","There should be no impact to 2018 for free cash flow and EPS, just based on timing of when we see that come through. You know about Baker Hughes and Transport and IS. Everything else that we are working through, it's probably about $500 million of free cash flow. But that's really more of a \u201819 thing.","John Flannery","Andrew, I would just add just in terms of the activity level around those smaller dispositions that good level of interested, very active, pricing looks good. So we like what we've seen so far on that.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Davis with Melius Research.","Scott Davis","Hi. Good morning, guys.","John Flannery","Hey, Scott.","Jamie Miller","Morning.","Scott Davis","If I was to look at one part of our model that we're probably a little bit insecure of, I should say, it's just around price in Power. And you're taking costs out, but are you comfortable at least that deflation in Power -- and I don't just mean on the OE side. I think we've seen that for 15 years.","But on the service side, are you comfortable that that has stopped as the rate of change? Or maybe just Russell could fill us in on where we stand there. Thanks.","Russell Stokes","Yes, so we continue to work through the assessments on what's happening in the transactional side of the business. So we've been paying attention, I would say, to it holistically around total margin performance.","There is an element of price that we have acknowledged that we felt up to now, just given that we did not have the level of attention that we should have had on that portion of the business. We also acknowledged in the past cost overruns around some of the execution that had taken place as well.","I feel with the exercise that Scott and the team that is working through that we ought to be able to see things stabilize. And actually look at how we provide a better set of product offerings to be able to support the transactional fleet as we go forward. But that is still a work in progress.","Scott Davis","So Russell, I mean, one of the things that -- your competitors have always said that GE is a little bit tough on price. And maybe you guys had made some decisions in the past that weren't economic.","Is that something that has materially changed under your watch? You are going into projects and contracts with more discipline?","Russell Stokes","So across the board, we are implementing much more disciplined underwriting practices. There is a new strike zone governance process that we are managing with myself and our CFO as well on the different levels of deals that we are willing to go do from a price, terms and cash performance.","The process is definite tighter than I would say than it was in the past. And we believe that that is going to be good for us in the long-term.","Operator","Our next question is from Gautam Khanna with Cowen and Company.","Gautam Khanna","Yes, I was wondering if you could just expand on the nature and the scope of the SEC investigation into contract assets, and whether - how far along you are in that interval review of the fidelity of that balance right now?","Jamie Miller","Sure. I can comment on that one. So this is a space, CSAs, that I've spent a ton of time on over the years. This is something that at the Company level we have really exhaustively reviewed it. We've got a deep finance team, a deep controllership team.","And as the SEC has started to take a look at this, I would tell you its very early days. As I have come into the role, I mean, just like John, I am going through a very deep review on pretty much everything in finance.","Look, there is nothing here that I am overly concerned about. But look, if I see something, we will deal with it. But I don't see anything at this point.","Gautam Khanna","And to your point, it's early days. Just to follow up --","Jamie Miller","Early days in the process with the SEC, yes.","Gautam Khanna","Okay. And to follow up on an earlier question on GE Capital and potential liabilities not reserved for. I'm just curious -- to the extent that there is any exposure, maybe it's on some of the residual WMC or what have you, where is it? Where would we possibly have some exposure that maybe isn't fully reserved for now.","Just because the charge that you talked about last week that was going to hit us in Q4 and did was bigger than we expected. I'm just curious -- you've kind of gone through everything or have you? I mean, are we still in the discovery mode of some of the liabilities from years back that could actually bite us?","Jamie Miller","I think we've got a good inventory of what we see. And as we've gone through this, I think our reserves are appropriately set. I think what will play out over the next year or two is really the work with FIRREA and the Department of Justice.","And look, as that plays out, we will see where that goes. If we need to take additional actions in GE Capital, we will take them. But it's really too early to speculate at this point on how that could land.","Operator","Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joe Ritchie","Hey. Good morning, guys.","John Flannery","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie","Jamie, I wanted to ask you a question. Early, you made reference to the better cash flow in 4Q partly being related to some timing. It sounded like some receivables timing in 4Q.","So I'm just curious. As it relates to the 1Q cash flow number -- last year, I think you guys were down about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of free cash flow. Is the expectation then for 1Q that it should be then worse than it was last year partly because of this timing?","Jamie Miller","I don't expect it to be worse than last year. I actually expect it to be better than last year. I think what you are going to see, though, is a bit of a push around progress timing. If you remember, we were really hit by progress coming into 2017 in the Renewables business. And that should be a non-repeat going into \u201818. So that should be helpful to us.","Having said that, with the timing of progress between fourth quarter \u201817, first quarter of \u201818 that we saw with Power and Aviation, that's going to swing back around. So I do expect it to be negative, but not nearly as bad as last year.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. That's helpful. Thank you.","John Flannery","Just beyond that, that whole cash thing. Obviously, with orders and deposits and things, those things move around in a discrete manner. What we're really focused on is driving the machine behind our inventories and our supply chains and our commercial terms.","So these will move around a little bit based on discrete orders. But what we are really tracking is how are we doing on managing the overall machine, if you will.","Joe Ritchie","Got it. And John, on that point, there's been no change then to the $2 billion or so in working capital improvements that you are expecting in 2018?","Jamie Miller","That's correct. In fact, I expect it should be slightly better than that.","Operator","And our final question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy","Good morning, everyone. The first question is just on the raise in the effective tax rate for modeling purposes in the out years for Industrial. How does that affect how you are thinking just conceptually about cash, CFOA, and Industrial free cash? How much of a potential headwind could that be in the out years?","Jamie Miller","I think over the next several years, the impact of the transition tax should be quite small. We are modeling mid- to high-teens tax rate over the next couple of years, really as we've got credits and other losses and deductions that will continue to carry us through. As we get out into the 2020s, that rate will moderate into the low 20%s. In terms of the cash modeling, for the near term, we don't expect a significant shift in that profile.","Robert McCarthy","But over the longer term, obviously, that's a structural headwind?","Jamie Miller","Over the longer term, I think we have to see what our tax positioning is. Look, I think it's hard to speculate at this point three to four years out on that one.","Matt Cribbins","Thank you, John. Before we wrap up, I would just like to thank everyone for joining today. Reminding that a replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our investor website. John? To you.","John Flannery","Great, Matt, thanks. I'd just wrap up by saying there is really three thoughts as I look at the quarter and then move ahead into 2018. One is, as we said, we are deeply focused on running every asset that we own in a more effective manner.","So back to basics on costs, cash, capital allocation, people, project execution. And I think you saw signs of that in Q4. I'd call the green shoots on that in Q4, and that's really the core focus of the business into 2018.","We did talk in November about focusing on Power, Aviation, and Healthcare. We really like the franchises we have in all three of those. I will do whatever it takes really to make sure that those businesses are positioned to flourish in the future, have the right resources, have the right investment flexibility. And we are looking at any option we need to think about in that context.","And we are really thinking about not just how they flourish in 2018, but 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now. What is the best outlook for those businesses that we can create for our customers, for our teams. And when we have that right, obviously, it will work for the shareholders.","And then the last thing I really just want to say is to the best part -- I've got almost six months under my belt as CEO. The best part has been just watching our GE team up close. It's an incredibly passionate team about our businesses, about serving the customers, about each other. And I would say most importantly, in the context of 2017 into 2018, it's a deeply competitive team. And it has a will and a deep desire to be a winner.","And so when I look at the overall picture for GE, I always come back to that. I always come back to the strength of the 300,000 employees and I would just say as we head into 2018 and go into battle in 2018 with that team and with the strength of the businesses, I'd just close saying I'm confident we can do this. So thanks for your time and we will see you in the future. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. Good day."],"10349":["General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call October 30, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Steve Winoker - Vice President of Investor Communications","Larry Culp - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jamie Miller - Chief Financial Officer ","Conference Call Participants","Andrew Obin - Bank of America","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","Nigel Coe - Wolfe Research","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets ","Scott Davis - Melius Research","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citi","Julian Mitchell - Barclays","Nicole DeBlase - Deutsche Bank","John Inch - Gordon Haskett","Josh Pokrzywinski - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good day, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the General Electric Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Brandon, and I'll be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Steve Winoker, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Steve Winoker","Thanks, Brandon. Good morning and welcome to GE's third quarter 2019 earnings call. I'm joined by our Chairman and CEO, Larry Culp; and CFO, Jamie Miller.","Before we start, I'd like to remind you that the press release presentation and 10-Q are available on our website. Note that some of the statements we're making are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","Please note that we'll be hosting a Healthcare Investor Day on Monday December 2 in conjunction with the RSNA conference in Chicago. Additionally, we provided the upcoming earnings dates in the appendix.","With that, I'll hand the call over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Steve, thanks. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start off with some thoughts on our performance and our strategic priorities, then Jamie will cover the quarter in detail before I wrap with our updated outlook.","Overall, our third quarter results reflect one more quarter's worth of progress in our multi-year transformation of GE. Orders were down 1% organically year-over-year due to tough comps at Power and lower LEAP orders at Aviation in part due to the 737 MAX grounding.","We ended with backlog of $386 billion, up 14% year-over-year. This comprises equipment of $80 billion, up 4%; and services of $306 billion, up 17%. We delivered strong Industrial segment organic revenue growth of 7%, with growth across all businesses, except Power, where Gas Power was up but Power portfolio was down.","We also delivered adjusted Industrial operating margin expansion of 130 basis points, driven by Healthcare and better controls at Power relative to last year. While margins are down 130 basis points organically year-to-date, we continue to expect to hit our full year margin expansion target.","Industrial free cash flow turned positive, generating $650 million in the quarter, though down $500 million from a year ago. This is ahead of our expectations, largely driven by continued Power stabilization and better-than-expected progress on the supply chain finance transition. We're raising our Industrial free cash flow outlook again today, which I'll cover in more detail later.","There were a few significant developments in the quarter, including a number of deleveraging actions that I'll talk to shortly. We ceded majority control of Baker Hughes, which resulted in a pre-tax loss of $8.7 billion. We completed our annual insurance premium deficiency test, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $1 billion, mostly driven by the low interest rate environment. And finally, we completed our annual goodwill test, recognizing a non-cash impairment charge of $740 million at hydro, a renewable energy business we acquired from Alstom.","So a number of steps to mitigate risk and clean up the GE portfolio. But make no mistake, we still have work to do. At Power, we're focused on daily management, improving transactional services and cost-out initiatives. At Renewable Energy, we're focused on the significant delivery ramp, turning around hydro and grid and overall better project execution.","Across these two businesses as well as corporate, we're investing in restructuring and our expected cost savings remain on track. We're also moving the center of gravity from corporate to the businesses, a notable cultural shift for GE.","Moving to slide three. We're doing what we said we would do. In 2019, we've been hyper-focused on our two strategic priorities. First, we're improving GE's financial position and we've taken a number of actions on this front in the quarter. At Industrial, we sold a portion of our Baker Hughes stake for approximately $3 billion of proceeds and we exited Wabtec, bringing in another $1.6 billion. Year-to-date, we've collected $9 billion of proceeds. And at Capital we announced the PK AirFinance sale.","We started putting that cash to work, with a $5 billion Industrial debt tender and we recently announced important but difficult changes to our U.S. pension plan that will reduce our Industrial net debt by $4 billion to $6 billion. Second, we're running our businesses better, with an eye toward unlocking the value that clearly exists in GE's portfolio.","On that front, at Power, we continue to see signs of stabilization due to better project discipline and execution. Specifically, at Gas Power organic, revenue was up 3% and we hit a major milestone with our hundredth HA turbine order in the quarter. We reduce reported fixed cost 9% year-to-date, as we right-sized the business for our market realities.","At Renewable Energy, we're well positioned to capitalize on the energy transition. Orders and revenues were up double digits again, as we delivered approximately 1,400 turbines and repower kits in the quarter. We're seeing strength in international orders and order pricing continues to improve. We signed the first commercial deployment of Haliade-X and our largest Cypress order to-date.","At Aviation, we have a strong global franchise with an installed base of nearly 70,000 engines. Service revenues in the quarter were up 7% and we expanded our win rate on aircraft engine selection to 62% on the A320neo. While we're managing the portfolio renewal, we're still on track to deliver 20% segment margins this year. And CFM is working closely with Boeing and our carrier customers to ensure the safe return to service of the 737 MAX.","In Healthcare, we're operating at the centre of precision health. We're driving new innovation, enabling our customers to improve patient and operational outcomes. For example, we received the industry's first FDA clearance to embed AI apps on a medical device for triage in our critical care suite this quarter. We also continue to expand margins, which were up 90 basis points organically, driven by both volume and cost productivity.","I'd like to take a moment here to mention GE Digital. This business remains within the GE family of growing an important P&L in its own right within corporate, which will serve customers in Power Grid, Oil & Gas and select manufacturing industries. Under the new leadership of Pat Byrne, the team is refining its focus to leverage GE's first-mover investments in industrial software and analytics to be an important contributor to our customers' digital futures.","During the quarter, a couple of changes in the way we're operating really began to take root. And while their impact is not yet visible to investors, I'm optimistic that it will be over time. First, our lean transformation is underway. One of the most pleasant surprises for me has been that once I began to talk more about lean, especially after our leadership event in Greenville in June, a flood of people deep in the organization began reaching out, raising their hands, looking to help. I was at our Lynn Massachusetts military engine plant recently and heard operators following an Action Work-Out talk passionately about how lean triggers cultural change and greater accountability.","In a different lean event recently at our MR production facility in Florence, South Carolina, teams identified $50 million of potential savings in just four days. And lean goes well beyond manufacturing. GECAS for example is using lean to reduce turnaround time, when transitioning an airplane from one lessor to another, which will save our customers money and improve our on-time delivery. The opportunities at GE are endless, which is why the second change, our strategy reviews, is so important.","This quarter, we held sessions with each of our businesses designed to answer two fundamental questions. What game are we playing? And how do we win? These were multiday sessions, not flybys, with robust debates about strategy and priorities, aimed at growing our topline, expanding margins, generating cash and delivering innovation and customer satisfaction for our customers.","Over time, our lean Action Work-Outs will be targeted to our strategic objectives and will channel the interest, the enthusiasm and skill that exist within these walls right now, toward driving improved and sustainable results. So, in summary, the hard work continues. And from the inside, I'm seeing the improvements I wanted to see when we started on this path a year ago, improvements that will yield long-term results for all of GE stakeholders.","Jamie, I'll turn it over to you.","Jamie Miller","Thank you, Larry. Starting with the third quarter summary, orders were $22.5 billion, down 5% reported and down 1% organically, with strength in Renewable Energy offset by declines in Power and Aviation. Equipment orders were down 4% organically, while services were up 3%. Consolidated revenue was $23.4 billion flat to prior year, with Industrial segment revenues up 3% reported and 7% organically. The biggest drivers of growth were once again the Renewable Energy onshore wind ramp along with Aviation equipment.","Year-to-date, Industrial segment revenues are up 6% organically. Adjusted Industrial profit margins were 10% in the quarter, up 150 basis points reported and 130 basis points organically. The majority of margin accretion was driven by the non-repeat of about $800 million of charges we took in Gas Power last year. We saw organic expansion in Healthcare, but declines in Renewable Energy and Aviation due to negative mix.","Net earnings per share was $1.08 loss. As Larry mentioned, we sold 144 million shares of Baker Hughes. And as a result, we no longer hold a majority stake in the company. Beginning this quarter, its historical results are now reported in discontinued operations for all periods. Upon deconsolidations, we recognize an after-tax loss of $8.2 billion or $0.94. We also elected to measure our remaining Baker Hughes investment at fair value, which is recognized in earnings.","Continuing EPS was negative $0.15 and adjusted EPS was positive $0.15. Walking from continuing EPS, we had $0.02 of losses, primarily from the unrealized mark-to-market of our remaining Baker Hughes investment and our Wabtec stake exit.","On restructuring and other items, we incurred $0.03 of charges related to restructuring and M&A costs across our segments principally at corporate. And next, we incurred a $0.02 charge for the $5 billion debt tender, which reduces pre-tax interest expense by $150 million per year, generating positive economics.","Non-operating pension and other benefit plans were $0.05 in the quarter. We also had two more developments, which Larry mentioned earlier. We took an $0.08 non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to Hydro, eliminating all goodwill associated with that business. And as disclosed in our last 10-Q Hydro continues to experience order declines and increased project costs, which resulted in a downward revision of the business's current and projected financial profile.","We booked a $0.09 after-tax charge related to our annual insurance premium deficiency test, largely driven by a significant decline in market interest rates. I'll cover this in more detail with GE Capital later Excluding these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.15 in the third quarter.","Moving to cash. Industrial free cash flow was $650 million for the quarter and $500 million lower than prior year. Income, depreciation and amortization totaled $1 billion, up $600 million after adjusting for the non-cash goodwill impairment both in 2019 and 2018.","Working capital was negative $1.8 billion primarily driven by accounts receivable, which was impacted by the timing of collections from Boeing related to the 737 MAX and a reduction in certain receivable monetization programs including continued runoff of long-term factoring and the decision to discontinue and shrink higher cost or inefficient factoring programs.","Progress payments were a usage of gas as expected, driven by timing of project execution and payment milestones primarily related to onshore wind and Gas Power projects. Contract assets were a source of cash of $200 million as services billings exceeded revenue.","Other CFOA was $1.7 billion, which includes the Baker Hughes GE dividend lower-than-expected Aviation allowance and discount payments in 2019 and non-cash items impacting income. We also spent about $500 million in growth CapEx.","Year-to-date Industrial free cash flow was negative $1.6 billion, down $1.3 billion due to many of the same pressures we saw in the second quarter including the onshore wind ramp execution and 737 MAX grounding.","Overall through the first three quarters, our cash generation is running ahead of our prior year\/full year outlook. Larry will speak more to the dynamics here when he addresses our outlook.","Lastly, our Healthcare business continues to perform well. Moving to liquidity on slide 6. We ended the second quarter with about $17 billion of Industrial cash. In the third quarter, Industrial free cash flow was $650 million and we paid approximately $100 million in dividends. We received $1.6 billion of cash net of taxes and fees related to the Wabtec exit and $3 billion from Baker Hughes. The impact from the debt tender and other paydowns was $5.5 billion and all other items were $100 million.","In line with our ongoing goal to reduce our reliance on short-term funding, average short-term funding was $4.3 billion this quarter, which was flat to the second quarter and down from $11.6 billion in the third quarter of 2018. Peak intra-quarter short-term funding was $4.9 billion down from $13.7 billion last year and also flat to the second quarter.","We could potentially see some fluctuation in these borrowing levels in subsequent quarters depending on further disposition timing. Overall, our liquidity position remains strong with $17 billion in Industrial cash and we continued to have access to $35 billion in bank lines.","Next on leverage. We are improving our financial position and expect to make significant progress toward our Industrial leverage goal of less than 2.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA by the end of 2020.","Third quarter net debt was $49 billion, down from $55 billion at year-end 2018, primarily driven by the $5 billion debt tender. This number excludes increases in the pension deficit due to lower interest rates as accounting rules only require an annual re-measurement of that liability at year-end.","However, at the end of the third quarter we estimate that the pre-tax pension deficit would increase by about $6 billion driven by discount rate changes offset by asset return performance and the recently announced pension freeze would partially offset this by about $1 billion.","As we've previously said, we have substantial sources to delever and derisk our balance sheet while the low interest rate environment increases amounts required to delever under our original plan, we had planned conservatively and believe that we are on track to achieve our goals inclusive of the impact of lower interest rates on our net debt.","We are putting those sources to work through the deleveraging actions, which we prioritize based on risk mitigation, economics, liquidity and achieving our optimal capital structure. It's important to note that while our external Industrial leverage target is net debt-to-EBITDA we also evaluate other measures internally including gross debt-to-EBITDA, and we will ultimately size our deleveraging actions across a range of measures.","You can see our current planned deleveraging actions on the right. Beyond the $5 billion debt tender completed, we announced pre-funding the GE pension plan by about $4 billion to $5 billion meeting the estimated minimum ERISA funding requirements for 2021 and 2022 and this will be completed in 2020. In addition, we plan to pay down the full $14 billion of GE Capital intercompany debt of which we paid $500 billion in the quarter and approximately $1 billion of maturing long-term debt.","As it relates to the pension lump sum offering in freeze, we may realized $1 billion to $3 billion of non-cash pension deficit reduction depending on the lump sum's participating population and the take-up rate. We continue to evaluate actions in light of the pension deficit pressure to ensure that we reduced our net debt to less than $30 billion as planned while maintaining sound liquidity.","Walking through our segments on slide 8 starting with Power. Orders of $3.9 billion were down 30% reported and down 20% organically. Power Portfolio orders were down 54% reported and down 34% organically, largely driven by steam power system down 49% due to a non-repeat of a large nuclear equipment supply contract. Gas Power orders were down 17% reported and 14% organically with equipment down 32% reported, driven by order timing from the first half and services down 6% reported.","We booked 3.1 gigawatts of orders for 17 gas turbines including five H units and two aeroderivative units and Gas Power services transactional orders were up across parts and repairs for multi-outage deals. Contractual services were down and upgrades were down in large part due to deal closures timing. Overall, Power backlog closed at $87 billion, which was about flat sequentially and up 4% organically when adjusting for dispositions. Gas Power represents $72 billion of the total Power segment backlog.","Revenue of $3.9 billion was down 14% reported and down 3% organically due to Power Portfolio, which was down 37% reported and 15% organically largely driven by steam. Gas Power revenue was up 2% reported and 3% organically. We shipped 12 gas turbines including five H units and three aeroderivative units in the quarter versus 11 gas turbines in the prior year, which included five H units and two aeroderivative units.","Gas Power services revenues were down 14% with contractual services down due to outage volume and mix, transactional revenues down on lower F-class outages and upgrades, which were down significantly driven by tough comps and deal timing of convertible upgrade volume.","Operating profit was negative $144 million, up $532 million with segment margins of negative 4%. The operating profit improvement is largely due to the non-repeat of Gas Power equipment charges as we continue to stabilize operations, partially offset by lower volume and services productivity.","At Gas Power, fixed costs were down 12% in the quarter, as we progress on our two-year $800 million fixed cost reduction target. In all, Power is a multiyear turnaround but we're making progress. Power remains on track to deliver its 2019 outlook of organic revenues down high single-digits and positive segment margins.","Next on Renewable Energy. Orders of $5 billion were up 30% reported and up 32% organically with particular strength in international orders, up 94%. Equipment orders were up 66%, while services orders were down 42%. Orders were mainly driven by onshore, up 19% including $500 million of Cypress orders and the offshore EDF deal of $700 million. New order pricing continues to improve reaffirming the positive trend we've observed over 2019. Overall, backlog of $27 billion was up 6% sequentially and up 19% year-over-year.","Revenues of $4.4 billion were up 13% reported and 15% organically, mainly driven by onshore volume up 27%. Equipment revenue was up 6% and services revenue was up 62%. Total turbines and repower kit deliveries were approximately 1,400 in the quarter.","Operating profit of negative $98 million was down $240 million with segment margins of negative 2%. There was a significant impact year-over-year due to higher losses from consolidating the legacy Alstom JVs and from legacy contracts. We also faced headwinds from pricing, tariffs, project execution and increased R&D investment, partially offset by cost productivity and strong volume.","Onshore wind was once again profitable in the quarter and year-to-date. We remain on track to deliver double-digit revenue growth in the full year with a solid plan on deliveries. However, as we said in the second quarter, the addition of Grid Solutions is further dilutive to our margin rate and we expect margins to be negative in 2019.","Moving to Aviation. Orders of $8.8 billion were down 4% reported and down 2% organically. Equipment orders were down 27% driven by commercial engine orders, down 54% due to LEAP engine orders down 90%. Services orders were up 15%. Backlog closed at $253 billion, up 4% sequentially and 20% year-over-year, driven primarily by long-term service agreements.","Revenue of $8.1 billion was up 8% reported and up 10% organically. Equipment revenue was up 11%, driven by the delivery of 455 LEAP units, up 152 from last year, partially offset by CFM56 units down 75%. We shipped 714 commercial engines this quarter, the same as the third quarter of 2018.","Services revenue was up 7% driven by mix and commercial services shop visits and total military sales were up 18%, driven by engine unit shipments, up 16% and growth and development programs.","Operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 3% reported on improved price and higher volume offset by negative mix. Segment margins of 21.2% contracted by 110 basis points reported and as in prior quarters this was driven primarily by the CFM to LEAP transition, a 230 basis point drag and Passport engine shipments an 80 basis point drag in the quarter. This was partially offset by military growth and commercial aftermarket strength. In 2019, we're on track to deliver high single-digit organic revenue growth and segment margins of approximately 20%.","Looking at Healthcare. Orders of $5.1 billion were up 1% reported and 2% organically. Healthcare equipment orders were flat reported, and up 1% organically, while services were up 3% reported and 4% organically. On a product line basis Healthcare System orders were flat organically, driven by growth in Life Care Solutions, ultrasound and services offset by imaging largely due to China market dynamics and longer sales cycles on larger deals in the U.S. Life Sciences orders were up 10% organically.","Overall backlog of $18 billion was down 1% sequentially, but up 5% year-over-year. Revenue of $4.9 billion was up 5% reported and organically. Healthcare Systems revenue was up 3% organically with strong growth in Japan and Latin America, partially offset by pressure in China and the Middle East. Life Sciences was up 14% organically.","Operating profit of $974 million was up 13% reported with segment margins of 19.8%, up 150 basis points reported and 90 basis points organically. Operating profit growth was driven by volume cost and productivity, partially offset by inflation, tariffs and R&D.","Cost productivity was driven by continued execution on design engineering, sourcing and services productivity. Healthcare is on track to deliver its 2019 outlook, which includes biopharma of mid single-digit organic revenue growth and margin expansion.","Moving to GE Capital. Adjusted continuing operations generated earnings of $123 million in the quarter. This excludes the impact of the insurance premium deficiency test. Compared to prior year, continuing operations net income was favorable by $104 million, driven primarily by lower impairments and lower excess interest cost, partially offset by lower gains.","Capital ended the quarter with a $109 billion of assets excluding liquidity, which is about flat versus prior quarter. Insurance assets increased due to unrealized gains driven by interest rate decreases and were offset by asset reductions at the WCS and from EFS asset sales.","We completed $2 billion of Capital asset reductions in the quarter, totaling $3.6 billion year-to-date and we're more than halfway through the $10 billion full year target with the signing of PK AirFinance. We finished the quarter with $11.8 billion of liquidity, down $800 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by debt maturities, partially offset by operations and disposition proceeds.","We still plan to contribute $4 billion in total to GE Capital in 2019, including $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter. And Capital ended with $60 billion of debt which was down $1 billion versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by debt maturities, offset by the intercompany loan repayment and fair value adjustments.","Discontinued operations generated a net loss of $18 million, which was unfavorable year-over-year by $58 million, primarily driven by a prior year investment security gain on sale and an indemnity reserve release.","As we look out to the fourth quarter, we expect lower earnings from Capital sequentially, driven by preferred dividend payments and lower asset sale gains. And based on year-to-date performance, we are increasing Capital's 2019 earnings guidance to negative $300 million to negative $100 million from negative $800 million to negative $500 million.","On the right-hand side of Slide 9, we provide an update on our run-off insurance portfolio. And as we've said before, insurance is a long-tailed, multi-decade portfolio that our experienced leadership team is actively managing with oversight from our reconstituted Audit Committee, including Leslie Seidman as the Chair. We completed the premium deficiency test in the quarter which resulted in an approximate $1 billion pretax charge or $800 million after-tax earnings. This was primarily driven by lower interest rates which resulted in a lower discount rate and adversely impacted our margin by $1.3 billion and partially offset by projected premium rate increases of $300 million.","In line with our normal practice, we will complete our statutory cash flow test in the first quarter of 2020 and similar to the GAAP test we expect an impact from the discount rate that will be based on year-end rates. In summary, we continue to focus on reducing risk across this portfolio.","Moving to corporate, adjusted operating costs were $303 million in the quarter, up year-over-year, primarily due to timing of higher-profit eliminations related to spare engine sales to GECAS in anticipation of the MAX return to service.","Higher costs also were associated with existing environmental health and safety matters and the non-repeat of gains associated with the sale of certain intangible assets in the third quarter of 2018.","We are increasing our 2019 outlook for adjusted corporate costs to negative $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion, largely driven by the higher profit eliminations and increased EH&S reserves. Excluding these items, corporate costs would be in line with our original outlook of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.","Gross corporate costs continued to decrease as people processes and accountability are further pushed down to the segments. The corporate team is making steady progress on gross headcount reductions eliminating approximately 7,000 in 2019. And of these about 2,000 of those are real cost out most of which is felt in the segments and the remainder was pushed to the segments. We continue to push control and accountability down to the businesses.","And with that I'll turn it back over to Larry.","Larry Culp","Jamie thanks. Moving on to Slide 11, I'll first refer back that the broader dynamics discussed in our original 2019 outlook. Top of mind is Power execution and returning the business to profitability while working through legacy items.","At Renewable Energy we're focused on delivering through the PTC cycle while managing a number of legacy projects and nonoperational items. At Aviation and Healthcare, we see continued strength in both franchises, yet we're intensely focused on running them even better. Recall our raised outlook at the half for revenue EPS and free cash flow was largely due to better Power performance and lower restructuring and interest expense.","As mentioned earlier, we've deconsolidated Baker Hughes. This lowers our EPS forecast by $0.05 and our restructuring expense forecast by about $200 million with no material change to our outlook for organic growth margin expansion or Industrial free cash flow.","To help you digest the changes from our original guidance to our guidance today, we've included a detailed walk in the appendix. Reflecting on three quarters of results, many of the trends highlighted in the second quarter still hold. We see evidence of Power stabilizing, but we're working through a number of nonoperational headwinds there.","Aviation is negatively impacted by the MAX grounding and that has largely been offset by timing-related items. Restructuring across our segments is running lower than anticipated. Healthcare is performing well.","As it pertains to earnings, we're keeping our EPS outlook at $0.55 to $0.65 even after adjusting for Baker Hughes which is largely due to GE Capital earnings. For Industrial free cash flow, we're raising our full year outlook to breakeven to positive $2 billion. Compared to our original outlook, we've seen Power stabilize, lower restructuring, and interest expense, and better management of headwinds.","Since the midyear point, we've progressed on the supply chain finance transition, which has had a minimal impact and Aviation is stronger than expected due to lower allowance and discount payments this year and higher service billings, which has largely offset the year-to-date impact of approximately $1 billion from the 737 MAX grounding.","On restructuring our expected cost-out benefits remain unchanged, but cash and expense will be lower due to a mix of timing on certain projects attrition versus severance that allows us to reduce costs and executing some projects at lower cost than initially planned.","Next up in our operating rhythm is finalizing our 2020 budgets where we'll continue to evaluate additional restructuring opportunities, but only where the economics make sense.","All-in-all, we're encouraged by our progress in this reset year. But it's still early in the multiyear transformation of GE. We have more work to do to deliver our desired level of sustainable and growing free cash flow.","Moving to Slide 12, this year we're executing against our priorities and our lean transformation is gaining traction. As we've discussed, we're raising our Industrial free cash flow guidance again. For the remainder of the year, our watch items are largely the same; sustain macro volatility, trade and tariffs, the 737s MAX, and interest rates.","To close, I'd like to share some thoughts now being a year into this job. GE is a company with vast industrial strength due to our team, our technology and our global network. In the last four quarters alone, our Industrial segment organic revenue growth has averaged 6%. Our global installed base allows us to be in close daily contact with customers helping them solve important problems that they are facing, services which turn drive half of our revenue. This positions us well especially against the backdrop of an uncertain global economy. When we think about the relationships GE enjoys around the world which are really thanks to the hard work of our team, the leading nature of our technologies, and our uniquely rich history and brand combined with the opportunities we see in the marketplace. Let alone those inside the company to improve results and invest in growth we see considerable value that is within our power to unlock. I'm more optimistic today than I was a year ago that we can deliver it, and I'm confident that in 2020 and in 2021 we'll see meaningfully better performance for GE as a whole.","So with that, Steve?","Steve Winoker","Great. Before we open the line, we have a lot of people in the queue. So limit yourself one question. So we can get to as many as possible. Brandon, please open the line.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And from Bank of America we have Andrew Obin. Please go ahead.","Andrew Obin","Yes. Larry, I'm going to - I know other people will ask different questions but you spent a lot of time talking about renewables. And why is renewables so important? And when are we going to see positive operating margin on renewables and what can you take from renewables for the rest of the business? Thanks.","Larry Culp","Sure. Andrew, I don't think we tried to talk about renewables more or less than any of our four big Industrial segments. Obviously renewables is an important business. You saw earlier in the week the IEA come out with a forecast that would suggest the renewables space could be a $1 trillion business over the next couple of decades. Significant opportunity from a top line perspective, but as you point out we need to deliver better profitability amidst the growth we're enjoying today let alone growth that's down the road.","When I look at the quarter in renewables we saw margins down a little over 2% down 500 basis points year-over-year. You break that down I think what we saw really was a fair bit of encouraging news in terms of the way the team was delivering the step up in volume particularly onshore here in the U.S. and some of the progress that we're making on our cost productivity programs. That said that was fundamentally offset by a number of the legacy issues that we referenced in the prepared remarks and the consolidation of the Alstom JVs.","So from there we're really wrestling with the pricing headwinds which I think are again improving but not with today's shipments unfortunately. We saw 100 basis points of pressure due to tariffs and we continue frankly to have opportunities to execute on a number of projects better. So that's why those margins are down. But in terms of those things that we can control so that this can be a positive margin business in line with others in the renewables space particularly in wind I think we over the next several years should be able to demonstrate not only better margins but in turn better cash performance.","Operator","From JPMorgan we have Steve Tusa. Please go ahead.","Steve Tusa","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Hey, Steve. good morning.","Steve Tusa","Just on the corporate and related to Aviation. How much of that increase in corporate did come from spare engines to GECAS? And then would you expect this kind of headwind from MAX to basically flip positive kind of over the year following the MAX coming back to services?","Jamie Miller","Yeah. So Steve when we talk about the spare engines in the quarter specific as it relates to spares to GECAS the corporate elimination was just under $100 million this quarter and we are seeing spare engine shipments higher in the quarter about half of that now back on Aviation about half of that relates to LEAP. And what we've seen in the second half and we've seen it third quarter we'll continue to see it in the fourth quarter is an acceleration of the LEAP-1B shipments in anticipation of the MAX return to service. And overall, if you look at the levels we're seeing in 2019 for spare engine shipments they are up over 2018, but we expect them to be about flat as we go into 2020.","Larry Culp","Yeah. And Steve, I think just step back right you all know early in the life of a new engine program we're going to see spares represent roughly 10% of sales. We'll see that at the tail end of the program. I'd say everyone is focused on a safe return to service which puts a little bit more focus there. So that's why you see the step up here in the back half relative to the sales of spares to GECAS and others.","Obviously, the benefit we take in Aviation is eliminated at the corporate level so it effectively washes. But that's really what you're seeing. As we think about 2020, I think we're going to try to follow Boeing's lead here when we talk about the full year cash headwinds this year due to MAX that obviously assumes that we don't see a return to service this year.","That's just I think a conservative financial planning assumption we took on the last quarterly update. But as you can well appreciate, we're working very closely with Boeing, very closely with our carrier customers to prepare for that safe return to service not only with respect to the planes and the engines that have been delivered, but those that are in inventory or on the production line today.","Operator","From Wolfe Research, we have Nigel Coe. Please go ahead.","Nigel Coe","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to turn to free cash flow and you talked -- you've disclosed $4.4 billion of working capital headwinds in your free cash year-to-date. How does that reverse into 4Q? We normally see obviously a pickup in shipments so therefore working capital draws down. So how much of that $4.4 billion reverses in 4Q?","And then within renewables progress collections that's $0.5 billion down year-to-date and backlog is up materially. So I'm just curious on that dynamic. Why is progress down versus the backlog up?","Jamie Miller","So the $4.4 billion of working capital this year, let me just talk about a little bit of the background on it, and then as I go I'll talk about what we see really reversing in the fourth quarter. First, we had inventory build year-to-date of $2 billion. That's across renewables, Aviation and Healthcare. That largely shifts and reverses as we head into the fourth quarter with heavy fourth quarter shipment profile. We also in receivables had a $2.4 billion headwind year-to-date in working capital consumption for receivables. Big chunk of that is the 737 MAX.","We also have factoring programs coming down for the year too both through the continued runoff of our long-term accounts receivable, some decisions we've made to exit or discontinue higher-cost programs. And some of that is just volume seasonality mix sort of as we've gone through three quarters, which will reverse in the fourth quarter as well.","When you look at progress, we are seeing some mixing in progress between renewables and Power. Backlog is up on new orders, but progress upfront is a lower percentage. So, some of that moves around a little bit in the progress line.","Operator","From RBC Capital Markets, we have Deane Dray. Please go ahead.","Deane Dray","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Deane.","Deane Dray","Hey, would love to get an update on the Power portfolio, the work-outs on the individual businesses. Looked like steam had a tough quarter. And can you also clarify on hydro? GE was in hydro at one time. They got out of it. You're back in it with Alstom. Is that considered to be core to the renewables portfolio and that would be helpful. Thanks.","Larry Culp","Sure, sure. Well, let me take those in reverse order, Deane. As you know when we talk about renewables, the bulk of our revenue today comes from our onshore wind business. I think we like the renewables space broadly, and we're really trying to fortify the position we have both in offshore wind, you see that with the step up in R&D the introduction of the Haliade-X, but also other aspects, including hydro where frankly the businesses isn't operating to its full potential today.","So it's more of a project-oriented business. It's a small $1 billion [-ish] [ph] P&L within renewables today, where we clearly are paying off those inheritance taxes, which we've referenced through the course of the year. We think hydro can perform in line, if not better than competitors there. But there's work to do.","We've got new leadership in place and when we were with the team several weeks ago, reviewing the strategic outlook for the business in Paris, I think they see hydro as an important business relative to our overall renewables offering particularly in certain parts of the world, where hydropower is and\/or -- is and will be a part of the energy transition.","With respect to the Power portfolio, Deane as you know, we really have three businesses there. We have our steam business, our nuclear business and Power Conversion. Clearly, when you look at the quarter both from an equipment and a services perspective, we saw pressure. I think Jenny went through that in her prepared remarks.","Clearly a tough comp in equipment both in steam and nuclear and we are seeing some service pressure both -- in both of those businesses. Some of that is timing-related, some of that it's just where those businesses that hit again in the energy transition. I think we're encouraged by what we see in Power Conversion.","I give Russell Stokes here a ton of credit. Russell has jumped in. He's running that business himself in addition to looking after the rest of the portfolio, brought in a new CFO from the outside, Glen Ferguson. There's a lot that's underway as they look to manage that business closer to the customer while taking a good bit of cost out. So there's a lot of work to do here, Deane, in nuclear given the challenges there particularly in places like Japan.","We talked about steam power conversion, but I think the team is making good progress. You don't see it so much in these equipment and service numbers, but I think as we go into 2020, you're going to see improved margin and cash performance from these businesses ex the legacy Alstom-related issues.","Operator","From Melius Research, we have Scott Davis. Please go ahead.","Scott Davis","Good morning. I know everyone wants to talk about Power and Aerospace since they're the most topical, but I look at Healthcare and just curious through your eyes Larry, you're used to running some businesses with these characteristics of razor-razorblade characteristics.","In Healthcare, once you take out Life Sciences, the margin isn't all that exciting really. Historically been kind of a mid-teens margin business that requires a fair amount of capital and R&D etcetera. I mean is there a view yet that you have that, where that margin ought to be and how you get there?","And maybe just comments about how historically this is a business that really spent away a lot of the upside, so you'd get fits and starts and operating leverage, but it never really stuck? Is there a focus being placed on getting this business to more sustainable higher profitable levels?","Larry Culp","You better believe it, Scott. And I think the team understands that we're going to have a different profile in Healthcare when we are on the other side of the biopharma transaction. But that said I think there's a lot of conviction on Kieran and the team's part, myself as well with what we'll have on a go-forward basis, right?","Here we have a $17 billion revenue business, smack in the middle of most of that matters in healthcare delivery today. As you point out mid-teens margins; good, I think routines there with respect to driving productivity to offset price; good cash conversion.","But there is no way in which this business is optimized right? There's a lot we can do from a lean perspective here. That's why referenced the Florence facility event a few weeks ago. I think that is going to help us improve quality, improve delivery. We should see not only expense, but frankly cash come out of that business and drive better conversion.","I think if we can be smarter about where we invest, we don't have to see all that savings be spent away. Clearly, over time you're going to see us remix this business more toward the digital that's why referenced the AI progress with the FDA around the critical care offering. Services is an area where I think we see opportunity as well.","So going forward, I think the teams will be very focused on making sure that this is as good a business as any GE business. And given what I know about the space Scott, I seen no reason why this can't be a much stronger more vibrant part of our company. And I hope you'll see that in Chicago, when we have the Investor Day that Steve referenced in conjunction with RSNA.","Operator","From Vertical Research, we have Jeff Sprague. Please go ahead.","Jeff Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone. I wonder if you could just help us with kind of the timing dynamics that were at play here. In other words, thinking about the restructuring numbers coming down, how much of that is kind of a permanent reduction of costs you expected to incur versus kind of stuff shifting to next year?","And same for kind of the receivable supply chain program and aero allowances and all that sort of stuff, is there a meaningful year-to-year timing difference there?","Larry Culp","Jeff I would say on restructuring -- what you're really seeing is sort of three things: One, the timing dynamic that you referenced, I think we are in a number of places foregoing severance in light of some attrition which gives us an opportunity to reduce the spend, maintain the return.","And than just a host of other restructuring projects where whether we plan conservatively or delivering more effectively, we're getting a better return for our dollar. So I'm encouraged by that.","With respect to timing, what that refers to specifically are the ongoing conversations and discussions that we're having in Europe with the various constituencies involved in Power. And more broadly, I think we set ourselves up to work through that during the course of the year.","I think at this point, you may see some of that expense this year. It clearly will be a cash pull in 2020 and beyond. I'm not sure we're in a position to quantify that specifically today for you as those conversations are ongoing, but that's really what's happening.","We're going to continue to restructure. We'll see that. I think the quantum fade over time. But we want to make sure as we go through the 2020 budget process here in November that every good opportunity, every good project gets a full hearing because we really want to play the long game here and set ourselves up for better margins and better cash.","Jamie Miller","Yeah. And Jeff, I'll jump in on the supply chain finance, some of the factoring shifts as well. And maybe I'll talk about it in the context of our guide. We moved our guide from negative 1 to 1 to 0 to 2, and I think the important thing to know kind of foundationally is that the first half trends we've seen are holding.","So Power, continued stabilization. We see the benefit from interest. Larry talked about restructuring. But then when you start to think about the $1 billion this quarter, we are seeing a lower impact of the supply chain finance transition than we expected. So more than half of that $1 billion was really due to the absence of that, which is a real positive for us. When you look into 2020, that is something that largely does not repeat or we don't expect it to repeat in terms of the planning cycle.","Secondly, we're seeing better performance across a couple of our businesses; so strength in aviation services, coupled with some incrementally better Healthcare performance. And really when you look at the construct, that plus a little bit of the restructuring side, which Larry talked about, that really makes up sort of the bulk of how we think about the 2019 shifting, but you can glean some of the pieces going into 2020.","Larry Culp","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","From Citi we have Andrew Kaplowitz. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz ","Good morning, guys.","Larry Culp","Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Hi, Andy.","Larry Culp","Hi, Andy. Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Larry, intra-quarter you had said that you were watching Healthcare in China and potential impacts there of the trade war. It seems like the overall business was able to absorb the impact relatively well, with the exception maybe being China imaging. But can you give us more color regarding what you're seeing in China and Healthcare Systems specifically and the outlook for that business?","Larry Culp","Yes. No, we certainly saw some softness there in the third quarter, Andy. Interestingly, it was more on private side than the public side of the marketplace. I think, we are in turn planning conservatively here for the fourth quarter, just given those trends and some of the uncertainty in China right now around the relatively more short-cycle nature of Healthcare broadly, certainly in our business.","We have new leadership on the ground in China that is going. And Yihao Zhang is going through a number of changes in both the organization and some of our go-to-market activities. That'll take a little bit of time, I think, to put us on better competitive footing in country as well. So as we get into 2020, I'm hopeful that regardless of the macro there, we'll see better performance from the imaging business there.","Operator","From Barclays we have Julian Mitchell. Please go ahead.","Jamie Miller","Hi. Good morning.","Larry Culp","Good morning, Julian.","Julian Mitchell","Good morning. Just my question on the Power business. It looked like Gas Power lost about $100 million of EBIT in Q3. Just looking at that business in particular on the service piece perhaps, I think Jamie you'd called out Power Services productivity being an issue.","So maybe give more color there and how quickly you think you can improve that productivity on the service piece? And following up on Power Portfolio, maybe Larry, is there any kind of time frame around which you think about just an outright exit from pieces of it versus continuously trying to improve what you have?","Jamie Miller","So, Julian, I'll talk a little bit about Power Services and maybe I'll touch on some of the top line as well as some of the margin elements of it, and I'll break it into the three pieces. So Gas Power services, in the contractual book we actually have been seeing factored fired hours up.","So the fleet is running. We're seeing good utilization. But we were impacted in the quarter, both by outage counts being down as well as by different mix of outages. And so the major inspection outages were down as well, which really impacts how we think about what flows through.","In this book, we're really focused on cost to serve, meaning outage execution, how do we think about working capital management related to that. And that all brings it down to how do we continue to work closely with our customers, but accrete margin over time.","The second piece, the transactional book, we are seeing revenue down. But that is remixing to higher margin. And we see that coming through, as we've refocused the team on price, higher-margin work. In transactional, what is gaining revenue a bit here is some fulfillment issues and operations and we've mentioned some of the operational issues we've had earlier in the year. They continue and that's something that Scott and his team and Larry have really been deep diving and focused on how that execution path really shifts up.","Upgrades, we see good demand. The quarter was impacted by deal timing. We do expect some of that to flip in the fourth quarter. But if you pull back on services in total, expect a more positive profile in the fourth quarter. But we still see full year as slightly down which is a little bit different than what we were seeing maybe a couple of quarters ago.","Larry Culp","I would just say, with respect to the strategic question around Power Portfolio, it's important to remember that when you hear us talk about driving a lean transformation of these businesses, better upfront discipline around which projects we take on, how we price them, how we framed risk, let alone how we execute and how we support them in the aftermarket.","But that is not necessarily a strategic call once and for all time, right? I think our view is, we wanted to make sure we had an integrated steam business, both in equipment and services. That integration is underway, let alone the improvements that we've referenced.","Our nuclear business is a business where we see the opportunity to expand margins, admittedly in a relatively flattish space. And Power Conversion is a turnaround I'm excited about, given the traction I see and our monthly reviews with Russell in the business.","I think over time, those operational improvements will frankly expand the strategic optionality we have in and around each of those businesses, let alone the Power Portfolio as a whole. If and when we do something we'll have that discussion internally before we have it publicly. But in the near term, this team's focused on making sure, we deliver better performance, we have more options, long term. And again, I'm encouraged by the progress that I see.","Operator","From Deutsche Bank, we have Nicole DeBlase. Please go ahead.","Nicole DeBlase","Yes, thanks. Good morning.","Jamie Miller","Good morning, Nicole.","Nicole DeBlase","So I just want to talk a little bit about Industrial margins. No change to the full year guidance from zero to 100 bps expansion. Year-to-date we have 130 bps decline. Can we just maybe bridge how you guys get there with respect to the implied 4Q guidance? Thanks.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So Nicole, I'll just walk through maybe the macro themes on this one. And probably the most important to really look at is the second half non-repeat of the Power charges. So we took well over $1 billion of charges in the second half last year. You saw this in the third quarter performance. We expect it to continue in the fourth quarter, but largely a non-repeat of that, which is a big lift.","The second is continued strength in aviation services and the aftermarket there. Military helps but both of those two things really help us. We are seeing the LEAP\/Passport impact in the transition but still largely very healthy at Aviation.","At Healthcare, we've got biopharma growth and continued cost control at HCS. So that's favorable as well. And then, as you mentioned, we do see renewables negatively impacting our own MAX.","And when you start to think about that it's the renewable volume ramp that Larry mentioned and talked about coupled with the Grid and Hydro project execution. But net-net it's really the Power non-repeat and largely Aviation.","Operator","From Gordon Haskett we have John Inch. Please go ahead.","John Inch","Thank you.","Jamie Miller","Hey, John. Good morning.","John Inch","Hey, Just a question. Rough calculations, Larry, Jamie for Aviation suggesting maybe sitting on a pretty sizable cash advance built up over the years. First does that create kind of future cash headwind? And when will that start? And then second just thinking out loud. If customers start to cancel the MAX not all of them but maybe some, considering you've received sort of large cash advances I think it's like half the final bill for engine production, do you have to give the money back? Or how exactly does that work? Thank you.","Jamie Miller","Yes. So let me talk a little bit about MAX first and then I'll talk about allowances and discounts on the payable that's built up there. So first on the MAX, we still expect this year to be impacted to the tune of about negative $1.4 billion. When we think about how that comes through in future periods it is really difficult to predict.","A lot of this is going to depend on exactly how the reentry into service works. And specifically, logistics, production, scheduling there's just multiple variables here around the ultimate delivery schedule of Boeing planes to customers. So that's maybe -- as you think about 2020 there's multiple scenarios that could play out there.","When I really pivot to looking at Aviation free cash flow specifically, for 2019 negative one, four [ph] for the 737, we have seen that in our planning cycle largely offset by two things: One is accrued allowances and discounts, which is basically a situation where when we sell engines we've got contracts with both air framers and airlines and when the discounts are offered on these engines, the payment for the engine can be from the airframer but the payment for the discount can be paid separately to the airline.","And they have a lot of timing variability depending on how programs are launching and different production schedules. We have seen accrued allowances and discounts build this year and we had expected at the half for that to largely reverse this year.","Now based on where we are right now, we're expecting a little more than half of that 737 MAX deficit to be made up by this build in payables that then will push into 2020 and shift back down to your point.","The other part where we're seeing strength in Aviation free cash flow is as I mentioned before, just the Aviation aftermarket and services side of things. Just nice cash flow continuing to come through there better than we expected. So hopefully that gives you the sense for 2019. And again, 2020, MAX a little bit TBD and we do expect that accrued discounts and allowances to also shift downward, which we'll see some pressure there but some goodness from MAX, hopefully.","Larry Culp","John, I think that obviously, we didn't come into this year expecting what has played out in that regard. Again our primary focus is to support Boeing and our carrier customers with respect to what they return to service. But with respect to the cash flows in this business, we had over $4 billion last year despite some of the MAX dynamics, as Jamie just outlined.","I think we are encouraged by the work the team has done this year. And going forward, given our market leadership position, the installed base, the new engines we have coming online not only commercially, but frankly the growing military business that we have, the opportunities to drive lean at Aviation, particularly with respect to improving inventory turnover and on-time delivery, I just think there's a lot of potential here given the secular tailwinds in Aviation, our position in the space to build off this cash flow base that we delivered last year. And hopefully, we'll deliver this year for many years to come.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley, we have Josh Pokrzywinski. Please go ahead.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Hi, good morning everyone.","Jamie Miller","Good morning.","Larry Culp","Hey Josh, good morning.","Josh Pokrzywinski","Just want to follow up on the Power order comment Jamie that you expect a lot of that to flip into the fourth quarter. If I recall, there was a pretty big order from Ohio that came out. Is that in the 3Q number, which I guess would imply kind of maybe the smaller order sizes are pretty small in the quarter? So, maybe just size that for us? And then Larry, following up on your comment earlier about an uncertain macro environment, where do you think you're really seeing that in the business? I mean, I think by and large, it's not really apparent in Aviation and Healthcare where maybe you would see a bit more. And Power kind of has its own issues. So maybe talk about how the macro is kind of informing your thinking right now.","Larry Culp","Josh your -- if we just take those in reverse order, I would say that you're right. With the long-cycle nature of our business right, I think the installed base, the backlog, half the business in the -- half the revenue in the aftermarket, we don't have a tremendous amount of near and short-cycle exposure. But clearly, whether -- pick the business right, pick the newspaper. There's clearly a lot of concern out there as to where the economy is globally and what are we going to be dealing with in 2020.","That said, as we look at our position in Aviation, absent the issues we talked about, I think we like a lot of what we see. Clearly both at Power and at renewables, I think what's most relevant is where we are and how we play through the energy transition much more so than any economic pressure. And while there are some dynamics in and around Healthcare that I mentioned earlier say in China, I think by and large, again given the nature of Healthcare, while we have some short-cycle exposure to a degree, it's far less than most businesses.","And as we go forward, I think we look at that 7% organic growth in the quarter, the 6% over the last four is evidence that even amidst the economic and political uncertainty that's out, this is a portfolio with secular dynamics around it that on balance should help us weather any storm that may come.","Jamie Miller","Yes. And Josh on the Power Services and Power overall orders, when I was talking before about some better profile in the fourth quarter, I was talking specifically about services revenues in Power. If I really look at the Gas Power orders, we year-to-date have booked 12.8 gigawatts versus 7.2 gigawatts in the third quarter year-to-date 2018, so really pretty healthy for the year this year already. The Ohio order yes was in 3Q.","Larry Culp","And remember Josh that we -- I think we said even on the first quarter call, that one of the pleasant surprises is that the order book that we were anticipating, materializing in Power, particularly Gas Power this year looked like it was coming in earlier. So, I think what you see a little bit relative to the year-on-year comp is just that a strong first half, good year-to-date numbers and I think -- we think a year that on balance will come in as anticipated.","Operator","Thank you. And we will now turn it back to Mr. Winoker for closing remarks.","Steve Winoker","Great. Thanks everybody for joining the call this morning and we will be available for your questions following.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Trevor Schauenberg, vice president of investor communications.  Please proceed.","Trevor Schauenberg ","Thank you, operator. Good morning, and welcome everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s first quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued a press release earlier this morning and the presentation slides are available via the webcast. The slides are available for download and printing  on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast we have our Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO Keith Sherin. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Trevor, and good morning everybody.  In the first quarter, our market conditions proved to be volatile.  Most of our emerging markets, including China, remain strong.  However, the U.S. indicators were mixed, while housing improved.  Some of our shorter cycle energy segments experienced push outs from March.  We planned for Europe to be similar to 2012, down again, but it was even weaker than we had expected.  And finally, we had an FX headwind in our oil and gas business.","Based on this backdrop, our results were mixed.  Our EPS was $0.39, up 15%.  This was actually $0.35, because not all of the NBC gain was offset by restructuring in the quarter.  Leading indicators in our longer cycle infrastructure businesses were encouraging, with orders up 3%, which was 6% ex wind.  Equivalent orders were up 10%, and we had a 1.3x book-to-bill ratio in the quarter.  So this gives us confidence in our delivery schedule for the second half and beyond.","Power and water was a drag on our overall results.  Wind and thermal units were down in the fourth quarter, but that was expected.  We experienced incremental pressure in European services and based on our current backlog, however, we expect shipments to significantly improve in the second half.  And we\u2019ll show you a detailed chart with the financial profile for the remainder of the year.","Finally, GE Capital delivered a solid quarter, up 9%, while they continue to shrink their noncore assets, which are down $17 billion in the quarter versus previous years.  We remain focused on our operating priorities.  We were able to accelerate restructuring actions, and we\u2019ve taken out $200 million of structural SG&A costs in the first quarter, well on our way to at least a $1 billion reduction in 2013.","Margins were negatively impacted by some of the revenue shortfalls in Europe in power and water, but we remain on track to deliver the 70 basis points margin expansion this year, and we\u2019ll show you more details later in the deck.","We finished the quarter with $90 billion of consolidated cash and $22 billion of cash at the parent level.  We returned $3.9 billion of cash to investors in the first quarter, including $2 billion of dividends, and $1.9 billion of share buyback.","We announced the intent to purchase Lufkin, a $3 billion bolt-on acquisition which broadens our artificial lift portfolio in oil and gas.  For perspective, GE\u2019s artificial lift business grew by 12% in the quarter.  We expect to close this transition and the previously announced Avio deal in the second half of this year, and both deals will be accretive to industrial earnings in 2014.","So in summary, our industrial segment profits were about $200 million below our expectations, and that really was a function of Europe, which worsened during the quarter and some short cycle pushouts from March into the second quarter.  We were able to offset that gap by doing a good job on corporate costs and slightly better GE Capital performance.  So that\u2019s really a summary of the first quarter.","Overall orders were a good story, up 3% overall and 6% ex wind.  Equipment orders grew by 10%.  Oil and gas and aviation were particularly strong, and power and water, ex wind, grew by 10%.  We ended the quarter with $216 billion in backlog, which is a record for GE.  Orders pricing was up 0.6 points, in line with expectations.","Many growth markets were strong.  China was up 67%, Latin America was up 44%, the Middle East and Northern Africa were up 22%, and Sub-Saharan Africa was up 41%.  Service orders were mixed.  Our investments closely track commercial aviation\u2019s fares, and they grew by 10% in the quarter.  That\u2019s good news.  And while power and water service orders declined, commitments increased, which helped future periods.  So the orders momentum and equipment and backlog expansion I think positions us well for the second half.","Revenue overall was challenged.  We knew the first quarter was going to be tough.  Overall, our organic growth was down 6 points.  But that really was a function of power and water, organic growth was up 2 points, excluding that segment, which is going through a tough cycle.  Our revenue grew by more than 10% in five of nine growth regions, including Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, Sub-Saharan Africa, Australia, New Zealand, ASEAN, and China.  We continue to see strength in many regions and believe that growth markets will stay on track for the year.","We grew backlog in service and margins in services.  Europe was a drag on service revenue overall, knocking 5 points off our growth.  But meanwhile, our oil and gas service revenue was up 10%.","Our investments in R&D continue to pay off.  We were selected by Boeing as sole source for the next-generation 777.  We\u2019re launching the world\u2019s most energy-efficient wind turbine.  Our leadership in locomotive technology is at the forefront of potential LNG conversions.  We continue to focus on new NPIs in healthcare and appliances, and we have a solid pipeline of advanced gas path upgrades worth about  $500 million, which should help power gen services in the balance of the year.","The biggest driver of industrial segment profit is the power and water shipment profile that we\u2019ve mentioned to you before.  In the first quarter, their operating profit was down 39%, driven by significantly lower gas turbine, wind turbine, and aero-derivative unit shipments.  In Europe, the service business was down about 22%, and was the primary cause of total service revenues being down.","Despite their lower volume, the team delivered 70 basis points of services margin improvement, and overall the team did a nice job in reducing cost, but volume decline was far greater, pressuring the margin rates.  We expect the second quarter unit shipment volume to improve slightly, but it will still be negative versus last year, and services should be positive and continue to grow margin rates in the quarter and throughout the year.","The second half volume is supported by our $9.5 billion equipment backlog, and will be up significantly in both wind and aero from the first half.  Services loss will be up in the second half, and we have better comps versus Europe.  The higher volume leverage, coupled with service margin growth, will drive an improved margin rate.  In addition, Steve and the team are working to deliver $250 million of structural cost improvements throughout the year.  So these efforts should deliver flat margin rate for the total year.","On total margins, the industrial margin rate was 12.9% for the quarter, down about 80 basis points, but up 40 basis points excluding the power and water cycle.  We saw solid improvement in four of our businesses, driven by strong value gap and cost execution.  Oil and gas was negatively impacted by foreign exchange, but some of that will come back during the year.  And we\u2019re planning on four businesses being above 70 basis points improvement overall.","If you look at the first quarter and total year dynamics, you\u2019ll see that we don\u2019t expect any significant impact from mix and the R&D drag from the first quarter is mostly timing in aviation and oil and gas, and we\u2019ll be neutral by the end of the year.","The value gap was strong in the first quarter, and we anticipate it continuing to strengthen throughout the year.  And the biggest negative in the quarter was the volume leverage from power and water, and as I said, it will be tailwind in the second half of the year.","As I\u2019ve said before, we went into the year with a plan that would deliver more than 70 basis points of margin expansion.  Given the first quarter dynamics and the short cycle energy-related volume pressure, we\u2019ve eaten into that hedge, but we still have an internal plan for 90 basis points of improvement, more than the 70 basis points that we\u2019ve told all of you about.","And that improvement is going to be driven by a change in power and water shipment profile, services margin growth, and accelerated cost out programs, and in many ways, our margin progression fits the pattern of previous years.","Cash in the quarter was impacted about $1.5 billion by shipment timing and a couple of unusual items.  We grew working capital by $800 million to support power and water and commercial engine shipments later in the year.  In addition, we had an impact of about $800 million in incentive and tax payout timing.  Not included in the number and not in the number is the capital dividend of about $450 million, which will be realized in second quarter CFOA.","The company has a very strong cash position, with $90 billion in consolidated cash and $22 billion at the parent, and we have no change in our overall CFOA framework for the year.  We remain committed to returning $18 billion to investors in 2013 through dividends and buybacks.","So now let me turn it over to Keith and give you more details about the segments.","Keith Sherin ","Thanks, Jeff.  I\u2019ll start with the first quarter summary.  We had continuing operations revenues of $35 billion, and that was flat with last year.  Industrial sales of $22.3 billion are down 6%, driven by power and water as you can see on the right side.  GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 2%, and both the total and the capital revenues include the benefit of the NBCU gain.","Operating earnings of $4.1 billion were up [14%], operating earnings per share of $0.39 were up 15%, and if you adjust for the net benefit of $0.04 from the gain exceeding restructuring, the operating EPS would have been $0.35, and I\u2019ll cover that on the next page.","Continuing EPS includes the impact of our non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations, which I\u2019m also going to cover on the next page.  As Jeff covered, CFOA was $200 million, driven by the working capital investments, incentive payments, and tax timing.","For taxes, the GE rate at 20% for the quarter is in line with the rate of about 20% that we expect for GE for the year, but there could be some variability from quarter to quarter.  And on GE Capital, the tax rate was 4%, and that rate is down because in the fiscal cliff resolution, the active financing exception was retroactively extended, which gave us a benefit in the first quarter.","Because of expected additional asset reduction opportunities, we currently expect to see a mid-single digit GE Capital rate rather than the 10% rate we previously forecasted.  On the right side of the page, you can see the segment results.  Total industrial segment profit was down 11%.  That was driven by power and water, as you can see.  Segment profit for the other industrial businesses was up 6%, and we expect power and water, oil and gas, energy management, to all improve as the year progresses, and I\u2019ll cover each of the segments in more detail.","Before I go through the business results, I\u2019m going to take you through the other items from the first quarter.  Starting with industrial, as you know, we realized a $1.1 billion pretax gain related to the NBCU transaction, and that resulted in an $0.08 after-tax EPS benefit.  The industrial NBCU gain was partially offset by $0.04 of restructuring and other items in the quarter.  The charges related primarily to our cost structure improvements and our ongoing simplification actions across the company.  And the amounts by business are power and water 94, energy management 60, healthcare 48, aviation 46, oil and gas 42, H&BS  38, and corporate 46.","On the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll see the restructuring plan for the rest of the year.  We\u2019re planning to offset the additional $0.04 related to the NBCU gain with $0.02 of restructuring in the second quarter and $0.01 each in the third and fourth quarter based on the timing of the restructuring actions being completed and approved.","Moving to GE Capital, we had $0.05 of benefit related to the sale of the 30 Rock real estate assets, and those gains were offset in two categories.  First, we had $0.02 of charges related to the platform exits and restructuring actions.  In the real estate business, we had an after tax charge for $123 million that related to our planned exit of another $2.3 billion of equity assets.  In addition, we had $53 million of charges related to cost reductions and non-core asset exits in the rest of GE Capital.","The second category is we had $0.03 related to consumer reserves.  In the first quarter, we finalized our updates to our reserve models in the U.S. retail business for a more granular segmentation of loss types.  You know we\u2019ve been working on that all year last year.","In the quarter, this included completion of the analysis on bankruptcy, which for us is one of the larger categories of losses, and the $0.03 also includes the impact for our consumer portfolios in Europe and Asia and also our current assessment of forecasted chargeoffs across the entire portfolio.  So, these adjustments are aligned with regulatory guidance and industry standards, and we believe we\u2019ve completed the methodology adjustments in our consumer franchise.","On discontinued operations at the bottom of the page, we had $109 million after-tax impact in the quarter.  On WMC, we added $107 million to reserves in the quarter as pending claims increased from $5.4 billion to $6.2 billion.  We ended the quarter with $740 million in reserves, covering both the pending and the future claims.  And on gray zones, claims were up in the first quarter above our model assumptions.  So, we booked $50 million of additional reserves, and we ended the quarter with $561 million of reserves.","In total, the operating impact from the other items netted to a $0.04 benefit for the quarter, and that will be offset through the balance of the year through restructuring, as I said.  So let me move on to the businesses.","I\u2019ll start with power and water.  We were planning for a tough first half based on the volume comparisons for wind and thermal, but the market was even tougher than we expected.  Orders of $5.2 billion were down 13%.  Equipment orders of $2.6 billion were down 6%, and that\u2019s driven by wind.  Our renewable orders of $1.1 billion were down 27%.  Our thermal orders of $759 million were up 10%, and our distributed power orders of $563 million were up 22%, so one of the highlights here in the quarter is that excluding wind, our equipment orders in power and water were up 16%.","Service orders of $2.5 billion were down 19%, and that\u2019s driven by tough comparisons, as well as order pushouts.  In the quarter, we had about $100 million of orders on several gas turbine upgrade projects, mostly in the U.S., that slipped out of the quarter.  And overall orders pricing for the business was flat in the first quarter.","Revenues of $4.8 billion were down 26%.  Jeff showed you the unit comparisons for the first quarter, which drove the decline.  Equipment revenue was down 42%, and service revenues were down 9%.  And segment profit of $719 million was down 39%, driven by the lower volume.","We reduced our SG&A by 14%, but it wasn\u2019t enough given the unit declines, and margins were down 3.2 points.  As we got to the end of the quarter, we had challenges in the market.  As I mentioned, we had about $100 million of gas turbine upgrade packages that slipped out of the quarter.  We also had two distributed energy projects for a little over $100 million that were delayed and pushed into the second half.  And in addition, we had expected a stronger European power and water service market, and that was down 22% on lower gas turbine utilization.  So all these items would have been in revenues, and of course would have had a significant impact on both margin dollars and rate.","On the right side is oil and gas.  Orders of $4.8 billion were up 11%.  Equipment orders of $2.9 billion were up 24%, driven by strong turbo machinery, strong drilling and [surface] orders for upstream production.  Service orders of $1.9 billion were down 5%, driven by lower drilling and service orders related to lower activity in North America.  Our backlog grew by $2.2 billion in the first quarter, to $17 billion, and orders pricing across the business was up 1.5%, our eighth quarter of order price increases.","Revenue of $3.4 billion was flat.  Equipment revenue of $1.7 billion was down 4% as our growth in drilling and [surface] was more than offset by declines in turbo machinery.  And service revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4%.  That was driven by stronger global spare parts sales, partially offset by lower measurement and controls short cycle volume.  M&C was lower as we saw customers delay investment decisions in the portfolio, and that impacted our expected revenues in both equipment and service by about $125 million.","Segment profit of $325 million was down 4%, as the benefits of service growth were partially offset by higher program spending.  And the one unusual item in the quarter here was we had $34 million of negative foreign exchange related to the weakening of the British pound.  This is on an economic hedge over a long term contract in the business, and we will recover.  As we deliver the project, that hedge will go back to zero as we deliver the units over the next 12 to 18 months.  Excluding the FX impact, segment profit would have been up about 6%.","Next is aviation.  The aviation team had another strong quarter.  Orders of $6.6 billion were up 22%.  Equipment orders of $3.8 billion were up 47%.  Commercial engine orders of $3 billion were up 90%, driven by $1.4 billion of LEAP orders and $875 million of GE90 orders.","Military equipment orders of $300 million were down 42%.  Service orders of $2.8 billion were down 2%.  Commercial service orders of $2.2 billion were up 8%, and our first quarter average daily spares order rate was $25.3 million per day, up 10%.  Military spares were down 44% on tough prior year comparisons.  And overall business pricing was up 2.1%.","Revenue of $5.1 billion was up 4%, driven by equipment, which was up 8%.  We shipped 596 commercial engines in the quarter.  That was up 13 units, or 2%.  And we shipped 279 military engines, which were up 44 units, or 19%.  Service revenues of $2.5 billion were flat as our commercial spare parts shipments were flat in the quarter.","Segment profit of $936 [billion] was up 9%, due to the benefits of a positive value gap and lower SG&A costs more than offset higher R&D and the impact of 28 more GEnx engine shipments.  And margin rates grew 80 basis points in the quarter.","On the right side is healthcare.  Orders of $4.3 billion were down 2%.  Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were down 3%.  For equipment, in the developed markets it was down 5%, and it\u2019s the same story we\u2019ve had.  Last year the U.S. was flat, Europe was down 9%, a little worse, and Japan was down 26%, 16% excluding FX, so soft.  Developing markets were up 4%, driven by China, up 16%, Latin America up 4%, India down 7%, and the Middle East down 19%.","By modality, MR was flat, CT was down 5%, ultrasound was up 7%, life sciences was flat, and diagnostic guidance systems, which is the X-ray plus interventional DGS, was down 10%.  Service orders of $2 billion were down 1%.  Revenue of $4.3 billion was flat, driven by the growth markets, up 10%, offset by the developed markets, down 4%.  And segment profit of $595 million was up 2% as the benefits of restructuring more than offset the impact of lower pricing and foreign exchange and margin rates were up 30 basis points.","Next is transportation.  Transportation team delivered another solid quarter.  Orders of $1.2 billion were down 26%.  Equipment orders of $413 million were down 59%, as locomotive orders were down 70%, driven somewhat by tough comparisons and also the net impact of the slowing coal market on the rail industry.  Service orders of $746 million were up 31%, driven by strong signaling, and orders pricing was up 10 basis points for the business.","Revenues of $1.4 billion were up 12%.  Our equipment revenue was up 3% as the impact of lower locomotive shipments, 143 this year versus 159 last year, was more than offset with higher mining volumes, somewhat driven by the acquisitions.  Service revenues were up 24%, driven by higher long term contract revenues in mining services, and segment profit of $267 million was up 15%, driven by the positive value gap in services growth.  And margins increased 50 basis points.","For energy management, orders of $2.2 billion were up 6%, driven by power conversion.  It was up 8%, and digital energy was up 11%.  Revenues of $1.7 billion were up 2%, driven again by power conversion up 11%, partially offset by lower revenues in intelligent platforms, which was down 15%.","And segment profit of $15 million was down 29%.  That\u2019s only $6 million, but it was driven by $15 million of higher expenses in Asia and Brazil for expanded capabilities to deliver the global $2.5 billion backlog that\u2019s grown over 25% in the past year.  So segment margins were down 30 basis points, driven by those investments, and we expect this business to grow segment profit in March and through the rest of the year.","Home and business solutions had another positive quarter.  Revenues of $1.9 billion were flat as we saw 3% growth in appliances, partially offset by a 5% decline in lighting sales.  And segment profit of $79 million was up 39%, driven by the positive pricing and a little lower program spend.  And margins were up 1.1 points for the quarter.","Next is GE Capital.  Mike Neil and the team delivered another solid result in Q1.  Revenues of $11.5 billion were up 2%.  If you exclude the impact of the 30 Rock gain, revenues were down 6%, in line with lower assets.  As I covered on the earlier page, the impact of the 30 Rock gain was offset by the restructuring and the reserve increases, and I\u2019ll cover those by business.  And net income of $1.9 billion was up 9%, as we more than offset the impact of lower earning assets with core growth and the AFE tax benefit.","We ended the quarter with $402 billion of ending net investment, which was down $32 billion from last year and $15 billion from year-end.  And our net interest margin was 5%, and our Basel I tier one common ratio improved 65 basis points to a little over 11%.","On the right side of the page, you can see our asset quality continues to improve.  Delinquencies were flat or lower across the board.  Our nonearning assets were down year over year and from year-end, and our liquidity remains very strong, $68 billion of cash, and we ended the quarter with less than $40 billion of commercial paper.  That\u2019s the first time in 21 years that we\u2019ve been under $40 billion, so substantial change in the funding profile of this business.","By business, the commercial lending and leasing business ended Q1, with assets of $176 billion, down 7% from last year, driven by primarily by noncore shrinkage, including $7 billion lower Penske, lower trailer leasing, lower [C Co] assets.  Net income of $398 million was down 40%, driven by the Americas.  In the Americas, net income of $267 million was down 51%, and that\u2019s driven by lower assets as well as a $166 million after tax impairment charge on one investment in the quarter.","CLL volume was good in the quarter, up 8%.  New business returns remain strong at about a 2% ROI.  And asset quality remains strong, with flat delinquencies and lower nonearnings.","Our consumer business ended Q1 with assets of $137 billion.  That was up 1%.  Net income of $523 million was down 37%, driven by the finalization of the portfolio segmentation that we covered earlier.  U.S. retail finance earned $382 million, which was down $259 million, driven by the reserve increase.","Excluding the reserves increase, the business was about flat in the quarter.  Asset quality in this business continues to be very strong.  Our 30-day delinquencies, at 4.2%, are at the lowest level we\u2019ve seen in 10 years that we\u2019ve been reporting on this basis.  And U.S. retail volume was up 6% in the quarter versus last year, and core Europe earned $145 million in the quarter.","For real estate, the team had another great quarter.  Assets of $43 billion were down 28% from last year.  They were down $3.5 billion from year-end.  Net income of $690 million was up more than $630 million from last year, again driven by the gain on 30 Rock.  If you exclude the gain and the charge for the equity exits that I covered earlier, real estate earned $261 million, and that was up over $200 million from last year, driven by higher tax benefits, lower losses and marks, and higher gains.","In the quarter, not including 30 Rock, we sold 52 properties for $1.3 billion, and $121 million of after tax gains, and 30-day delinquencies at 2.16% are the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008.","For the verticals, both [GCAS] and Energy Financial Services had strong quarters in the first quarter.  GCAS earned $348 million of net income.  That was up 9%.  Earnings were driven by lower impairments and higher operating income, and EFS net income of $83 million was up 17%, driven by higher gains.","So overall, GE Capital delivered another strong result in the quarter, and as you look forward to Q2, we\u2019ll continue to have the loss of earnings from shrinking assets ahead of schedule, and if you adjust for the one-time items that I just covered, a normalized run rate for GE Capital at the first quarter was about $1.8 billion to $1.85 billion.  In Q2 we\u2019ll also have the preferred dividend payment for the first half of 2013, and that is covered in our corporate line in our operating framework that Jeff\u2019s going to cover in a minute.","So with that, let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt ","Thanks.  Just again on the 2013 framework, we have no change to the overall operating framework for the year.  And by that I mean specifically we expect our EPS to grow in line with previous commitments.  The mix will change.  We believe it\u2019s going to be hard for our power and water business earnings in \u201913 to equal \u201912, which we\u2019ve talked about previously, primarily due to the incremental weakness that we\u2019re seeing in power gen in Europe, and services.","As a result, our industrial earnings will grow in the range of high single-digits to double digits.  On the positive side, we expect capital earnings to be slightly better, and our corporate costs will be lower.  Previously, we were at $3.5 billion in corporate costs, and we\u2019re now targeting $3 billion, so that\u2019s an improvement of $500 million.","We expect to hit our margin goals, and we are on track to drive SG&A as a percentage of revenue to 15% by 2014, while organic growth could be at the end of the range.  We\u2019ve reflected the changes that we\u2019ve seen in the market and we\u2019re going to be aggressive on costs as we go through the year.  So on balance, the rest of the framework remains unchanged.","And finally, just in summary, some of our markets in the first quarter of \u201913 were more challenging than expected.  Europe was tougher, and some of the short cycle markets were slower in March, and we saw some push outs.","But despite that, we still plan to achieve our full year EPS framework, really based on power and water strengthening, stronger backlog and deliveries, capital strength, and more cost out.  And we plan to achieve our margin goals.  We ended the quarter with very strong cash position of $90 billion consolidated and $22 billion at the parent, and we plan to return $18 billion to investors in dividends and buyback while continuing to execute on bolt-on acquisitions.","So in a challenging environment, we\u2019re committed to delivering for investors.  Trevor, let me turn it back to you and let\u2019s take some questions.","Trevor Schauenberg ","Thanks, Jeff.  Thank you, Keith.  Operator, let\u2019s open up the phone lines for questions.  I know we have another earnings call later today, so let\u2019s try to limit the questions to two a piece if we could today.  Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.]  And our first question is coming from the line of Scott Davis from Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Just on the margin targets, and I don\u2019t want to make you repeat yourself for the third time today, but just to be clear, you are expecting to make the 70 basis points for the year, including power and water, right?  Not excluding power and water?","Jeff Immelt ","Yeah, including power and water.  I think we started the year with more than we needed, at 130 basis points to 140 basis points.  We spent a little bit of that in the first quarter, but we see power and water strengthening for the year.  We think the margin rate for power and water will be kind of flat year over year.  And even with that, we expect margin rates to grow by 70 basis points, and   we still have a hedge in that number.  This is not an uncommon profile for us in terms of the way that the year lines up and stuff like that.  I don\u2019t know, Keith, do you want to just go through some of the dynamics of the margins?","Keith Sherin ","Sure.  Let me just start with the profile, and then we can go back to the pieces if you want, Jeff.  Over the last seven years, we always have margin growth from the first quarter to the total year.  And in five of the last seven years, we have declines in the first quarter.  So it\u2019s not an uncommon profile for us.  We grow our margins from the first quarter anywhere between 50 and 280 basis points.  On average it\u2019s about 150 basis points.  And in 2006 and 2010 we grew our margins approximately what we need for 2013.  So it\u2019s not uncommon, and we do have a lot of work to do, and we can take you through the pieces either by the categories or by business, Scott, whatever you\u2019d like.","Jeff Immelt ","I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve got in all of our expectations and all the execution models for the team.","Scott Davis - Barclays ","And as a follow up, when you think about this backlog that you\u2019re building and book-to-bill is solid and such, but are you booking this backlog at a margin that\u2019s accretive to your existing margin structure, that helps yield some confidence, one for the 70 basis points, but also set us up for 2014 to see operating margins continue to move forward?","Jeff Immelt ","The margins in backlog are actually higher.  We\u2019ve had good pricing for the past five quarters, and our value gap, when you really hone in our value gap, it is wildly positive.  We had a very strong value gap in the first quarter.  That\u2019s only going to ramp for the year.  So the value gap could be $800 million plus this year.  And so I think that all portends to good health in the backlog.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Tusa of JPMorgan Chase.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase","My first question is on a little bit of housekeeping on oil and gas.  Definitely a weaker performance than I was expecting.  The margin down year over year, the orders there have been trending really well.  You said turbo machinery was down.  Can you maybe give us a little bit more color around what drove the downside there?","Jeff Immelt ","Are you talking about top line or are you talking about orders?","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","Top line and profit, I guess both.","Keith Sherin ","I\u2019ll start overall with orders.  Turbo machinery had very strong orders.  They were up 70%, it was driven by strong upstream.  Again, those are a little longer cycle in terms of when they deliver.  Drilling and surface was up 48%.  We had more BOPs and risers up, pressure control was up, and artificial lift was up.  Subsea, we had one big order delayed in the quarter.  We had about a little under $500 million associated with a large subsea project that\u2019s been pushed.  We think that\u2019s pushed into the third quarter.","And on revenue, turbo machinery revenues were down in the quarter.  I think some of this is timing.  We had large LNG projects in the quarter relative to last year\u2019s Gorgon and LNG projects, Curtis project in Australia.  Drilling and surface was up 6%, with artificial lift up 15%  And subsea was down 10%.  Again, we had some tough timing relative to projects last year.  But the backlog itself is up a couple of billion dollars.  And pricing is up for the eighth quarter in a row, and it\u2019s a little longer cycle.","I think the only softness in M&C services was something we\u2019re watching.  It was a little less than we expected, a little over $100 million, as we just saw some push outs and people pushing out the investment decisions.  But the core of oil and gas, subsea, drilling and production, turbo machinery, has a very good outlook in terms of equipment deliveries.","Jeff Immelt ","These guys were, on a profit basis, probably 30 or 40 weaker than I really wanted them to do this quarter.  I still think this business is going to be high single-digit revenue, strong double-digit operating profit growth for the year.  I think what Keith mentioned, we saw late in the quarter kind of a flow business in the control side that\u2019s something that we\u2019re not counting on necessarily getting better for the year, but it was just kind of around the edges, or else I think we would have done better in the quarter.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","And then one follow up.  Again, we\u2019re kind of sitting here in a tough macro.  This happened in the fourth quarter.  I guess when I look at these results, and I listen to you guys explaining what\u2019s going on here, it\u2019s mind boggling how many moving parts there are here, especially again in GE Capital.  At what point do we again kind of maybe evaluate the size and complexity of the organization and make, I guess, a tougher longer term decision on the structure of the company?  It just seems like a little bit of macro weakness kind of goes a long way, and there\u2019s just so many moving parts to even be able to forecast and manage it.  It has to be a challenge.  So I\u2019m just curious as to how you guys view that in the boardroom.","Jeff Immelt ","Let me just go back and tell you what happened vis-\u00e0-vis my expectations.  I just want to maybe talk openly and just give you a thought.  I think the industrial side was about $200 million weaker than I would have planned for -- what our internal plan was.  We basically saw Europe --  Europe was running negative 5, negative 8 through February.  By the end of the quarter, that was negative 15.  That was a pretty big move.  I think you\u2019ve seen it reflected in a lot of other companies\u2019 announcements.  On the short cycle stuff, we saw pushes pretty consistent with what other people had seen.","Now, given the volatile time, the leadership team created multiple hedges in the plan.  We had a $500 million \u2013 we were always running corporate for less than what we needed.  We had other hedges in the company.  So by the time you put it all together, we\u2019re basically consistent with commitments, which is the way you\u2019d want us to run the place.  So I just think we\u2019re explaining $200 million out of a big company, but we\u2019ve been able to offset that through other hedges and operating disciplines that we\u2019ve got inside the company, which is I think what you want us to do.  That\u2019s my story.","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan Chase ","I appreciate it.  I think this year is obviously the -- again we\u2019re kind of sitting here and it\u2019s back end loaded.  So the second half is a very serious commitment that I know a lot of the investors I talk to are going to be watching very closely.","Jeff Immelt ","We\u2019re focused on it as well.  It\u2019s the way all the comp plans are driven, and the basic cycle of power and water is more or less consistent with the way we had talked about the year.","Keith Sherin ","This is a power and water story.  If you look, our revenues take out the NBCU gain, and you\u2019re looking at industrial sales were down $1.3 billion.  Thermal and wind are down $1.5 billion.  This is what we\u2019re going to be wrestling through.  It\u2019s that power and water volume profile that Jeff showed you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Jeff, you commented on the 2 to 6 that\u2019s more towards the lower end of that range for the full year.  And it seems that the weakness in oil and gas and the weakness in power and water are more of a timing issue, so we\u2019ve seen some push outs.  But the profile seems to be very much in line with what you\u2019d expected.  So I\u2019m just wondering what else is driving this down towards the lower end of that range for the full year.  First of all, I think it\u2019s prudent to do that because you had a negative 5 in the first quarter, but I\u2019m just wondering, maybe in some of the short cycle businesses, where are we now versus where we were in December?","Jeff Immelt ","I think the way we look at, just in total, how we run the company is we don\u2019t necessarily assume things are going to get better.  So, not in a catastrophic way, but we saw Europe marginally get worse during the quarter.  We\u2019re now not counting on that getting better.  We saw a couple of short cycle businesses get pushed.  We\u2019ve gone through a pretty granular analysis here of what we think comes back and what we shouldn\u2019t count on.","And I think when you do that calculus, we just think the smartest thing to do is to say to investors, look, we think this could be at the low end of the range because we\u2019re not counting on stuff getting better during the year.  If it does, great.  But we\u2019re not counting on it.  And we\u2019re going to take out costs accordingly so that we kind of hedge our bets.  So that\u2019s really the answer.  We just don\u2019t count on everything coming back that got pushed, and we don\u2019t count on things that we view as getting incrementally worse getting better.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley ","When we calculate our models, should we be putting a bit more pressure on healthcare and perhaps home and business solutions, or is it fairly evenly spread?","Jeff Immelt ","Power and water, we would like to surprise you guys on the upside as you go through the year, right?  So think about the power and water profile in the year.  And then other than that, I\u2019d say healthcare was a smidge weaker than we would have expected, but we still think oil and gas and home and business and the other businesses are going to be pretty solid.","Keith Sherin ","I think you said it exactly right.  When you look at what happened in the quarter, we tried to take that into account and decide what does it mean for the year, and not counting on Europe certainly getting a lot better.  That\u2019s going to take you probably to the low end of the organic range.  Power and water we originally thought would be close to flat.","I think today we\u2019re saying power and water probably for the year will be down a bit, and that\u2019s based on the profile that we saw in the quarter, and our expectation of what that means for the year.  You do see it getting better in the second half, and you do see the recovery, but in total it\u2019s probably a little weaker than we wanted for the total year.","The other businesses, we\u2019ll see.  I think we\u2019ve got a great backlog in oil and gas.  We\u2019ve got to execute on the long cycle projects.  What will we see in the short cycle there?  We\u2019ll have to see.  I think healthcare, we\u2019re talking about plus or minus 1% here, not a lot of change versus our expectations in the healthcare model I would say.","So I think it\u2019s prudent to plan the way we are, and as Jeff said, we\u2019re going to continue to grind away at taking out the costs.  We\u2019ve got more restructuring that will happen through the year as we said.  We\u2019re committed to getting the billion dollars of cost out.  And it could be higher based on what we have to do to rightsize this place for this market.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley ","And a quick one on the internal plan, the 1.3 points of internal target for margin.  Does that include the additional benefit from the restructuring from the NBCU gain?  Because the 1.3 points is higher than I expected?","Keith Sherin ","Yeah, it does.  That\u2019s one of the drivers to the difference.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","If I think about the EBIT bridge, you called out four main items behind that this quarter.  Last quarter there was a fifth, which was also service.  If I think about service and R&D, in R&D you had said back in January that should be sort of flattish as a margin driver.  Do you still believe that?  You highlight the fact that R&D was up 7% in Q1.  Is there something extra on R&D pressure maybe around the LEAP [X] or something that we need to think about?","And secondly, on services, you had a plus-plus there for services in the Q4 earnings slides.  Services now you had four consecutive quarters of flat to down orders.  The commentary around European services is obviously very bad.  And I just wondered if your margin guidance embeds a recovery, or how much of a recovery, in services over the balance of the year?","Keith Sherin ","The services, let me go to that point first.  We do expect a services improvement as we go through the year.  We have some specific items that we\u2019re working on.  For example, in power and water, as Jeff talked about, we\u2019ve got these advanced gas path upgrades.  We\u2019ve got over 50 of them that we\u2019re working on for the year.  We sold two in the quarter.  We\u2019ve got a number of those in the backlog, and a number of that still have to be closed.","So I think there are some specific items that we do expect.  We have some comparisons in Europe that could be a little bit better.  And the service margin rate was up 30 basis points in the first quarter.","So I think for us, when you look at the four factors on the margin page: mix, which does include equipment versus services, was a positive 10 basis points in the quarter.  We\u2019re estimating it will be flat for the year.  We\u2019re counting on less wind.  We\u2019re counting on more GNX engines, as you saw, but that was kind of in the run rate for the first quarter.  And we\u2019re counting on some services growth as we expect equipment to grow as we go into the second half.  So we do have some services growth in the plan.","Jeff Immelt ","R&D, the [unintelligible] will be flat.  I don\u2019t expect that to be a headwind.  I think we had aviation and oil and gas in Q1 that were at a higher run rate, but in total that\u2019s going to be flat for the year.","Keith Sherin ","It will be flat as a percentage of sales, yeah.  That\u2019s right in line.","Jeff Immelt ","And what Keith said on margin rates, again, I think we\u2019ve got a good window on margin accretion in the service business.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","And then just secondly on the top line.  If you think about sequestration, I guess, how are you thinking about that playing into your guidance for the revenue outlook in the military aftermarket in aviation, and also for U.S. healthcare?  Did you see much of an effect?  Or was it kind of just noise that caused some push outs?  And was that a factor behind the low end of the revenue growth guidance comment?","Jeff Immelt ","Let me start with aviation.  We have about 90% of our equipment on firm order for the year.  And so as you saw in the quarter, the equipment was actually up in the quarter, equipment deliveries.  We believe that that\u2019s going to remain very strong.  We\u2019re in certain programs that are priorities for the Defense Department and things that are on firm commitment aren\u2019t being cut right now.  We did see a decline in service orders.","Some of that was versus comparisons we had last year.  And we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out for the year.  It was down about 14% in the quarter on revenue.  I think that\u2019s about what the team expects for run rates on services.  But in the back half of the year, we\u2019ll have to see how the sequestration in total plays out.","I think there\u2019s a couple of offsets that you\u2019ve got to think about.  One is our international military engine business is very strong.  We had orders for about a little under 200 F-110s for the Saudi air force.  That extends the production line of the F-110 product through 2016.  We had India order for the light combat aircraft on the 414 and Switzerland on the 414.  And we\u2019ve got some significant orders in line for helicopter engines for both the army and the navy.  So I think we\u2019re concerned about it on the short cycle side in services.  I think it could put some pressure in the back half of the year.","In terms of healthcare, the U.S. market was just slow.  Is there one driver?  I think it\u2019s just the fact that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around healthcare.  Providers are consolidating.  They\u2019re worried about costs and making profit, and they\u2019re just being cautious on purchasing.  So there we\u2019ve got to drive our technology.","And we have to continue to drive the productivity, and that\u2019s what that healthcare team is going to do.  I think their year is going to depend on continuing to do well in the emerging markets as well as taking the costs out.  They had a good cost out performance in the quarter, and they\u2019ve got to continue to do that through the rest of the year.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","First question is maybe on capital allocation.  It dovetails a little bit with what Steve asked.  There was an 8-K that came out about a week after the proxy outlining that comp is going to be tied to 2015 industrial profits as a percent of earnings.  I\u2019m not sure why that wasn\u2019t in the proxy, but the real question is can you share that target with us?  It seems very apropos to the valuation construct in the stock?","Jeff Immelt ","I think the way to think about that is it\u2019s going to be consistent with with what we talk about externally vis-\u00e0-vis vision for the company over the next three years.  So in many ways, you\u2019ve got a perspective for that, I\u2019d say, already.","Keith Sherin ","And it\u2019s a balance of the measurements.  We\u2019ve got a cumulative EPS, we\u2019ve got a cumulative cash.  We\u2019ve got a percent of earnings that are coming out of the industrial business, which we expect to increase through the growth playbook period here, through that three-year period, as well as a return on total capital, which will also incorporate one of the returns from both our industrial side and our financial services side.","Jeff Immelt ","I think if you go back to the December outlook meeting, you\u2019ll see the guideposts.  And I think what we try to do is triangulate between total EPS, wanting to keep that on a certain trajectory and managing the mix of industrial, financial, generating cash, and making sure that our return on total capital.  So I\u2019d say the four metrics we have are pretty interwoven vis-\u00e0-vis how we think about value creation and how our investors want us to run the place.  But I would go to the outlook meeting and that\u2019s what gives you the guideposts.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research ","That\u2019s what I wanted to clarify.  Thank you.  And then just thinking about industrial, just kind of trying to put these pieces together, it looks like you\u2019re going to pick up $0.04 in corporate on the lower guide.  It looks like capital tax rate is $0.04.  It\u2019s unclear if industrial tax rate is a little bit lower.  But it feels like you\u2019re taking a dime out of industrial.  Is that the right way to think about it?  And could you share why corporate actually is going to be lower than you thought?","Jeff Immelt ","I think what we\u2019re basically saying is we think about the segments.  I wouldn\u2019t change any of those other than necessarily power and water.  And I think we basically guided power and water flat.  And we\u2019re saying that could be down slightly.  So I don\u2019t think we would agree with your math.","Keith Sherin ","Yeah, that\u2019s very high.  The capital tax rate is in the context of the total capital earnings for the year.  There\u2019s going to be a set of asset optimization transactions that we\u2019re looking at.  Some of them will cause potentially higher tax benefits, and it may also go with the lower earnings.  So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to do a direct offset for capital.","And for corporate, basically what we\u2019ve been able to do, first of all we had some better performance in the first quarter from NBC.  That won\u2019t continue obviously, but that\u2019s included in the negative 172 that we have sitting here.  And then on a run rate basis, we think we\u2019re going to be somewhere around $750-775 million of base corporate expenses.","We are getting some benefits from our simplification efforts.  We have lower spending across the corporate functions.  They\u2019re going to be down 10% for the year.  And that benefit will help us on our overall cost goals of getting $1 billion plus out for the year.","Operator","The next question is from the line of Shannon O\u2019Callaghan of Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura","Can you give us the gas turbine and wind turbine unit orders for the quarter?","Jeff Immelt ","Gas turbines, we had 8 units in the quarter.  We had 4 steam turbines versus 1.  On the wind turbines, it was down.  On renewables, we had 584 wind turbines versus 696 last year.  So it\u2019s down about 30%.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura ","Just thinking about this, you shipped 12 in gas turbines, and you got orders for 8.  What\u2019s going on by geography in that number?  I don\u2019t know the last time those were that low.  That\u2019s a pretty low number.  What are you seeing geographically?  And do you have any visibility into things getting better?","Keith Sherin ","They\u2019re very spread, obviously, in the quarter.  We\u2019ve got a couple of Latin America, a couple in the Middle East, one in Russia, one in [Azian], one in the U.S.  So they\u2019re spread out.  I think as you look forward, we\u2019re expecting to be somewhere between around 120-130 gas turbines for the year in orders.  So you\u2019re going to see that pick up through the year.  We do see some heavy activity in the Middle East.  We\u2019ve got some in EMEA, and we\u2019ve got some in Latin America, and we\u2019ve got some in Africa.  So it\u2019s pretty spread.  I think there some core activity in the Middle East, which will be the foundation of that activity for the year.","Jeff Immelt ","The [unintelligible] report we were up three points of share in gas turbine in 2012, so our position is still strong.  And I think what Keith said, it\u2019s still our expectation to have 120-ish of orders in the year.","Shannon O\u2019Callaghan - Nomura ","And then just a follow up on the mix question.  In terms of getting to the 65% industrial earnings with the mix adjustments to this year that you made today, obviously \u201913 is not going to be a year that really gets you far in that direction of the target.  With power and water kind of tracking below what you thought, does this reassess your route to the target in terms of organic methods versus portfolio moves?","Jeff Immelt ","I\u2019d say the macro was a little bit tougher than we had expected coming into it, but we still expect to have a really good year industrially inside the company.  And so I still think there is a good chance that our percentage of earnings in industrial grows this year, even with the adjustments that we made today.  And we\u2019ve always been very open on portfolio moves vis-\u00e0-vis what we\u2019re trying to do in GE Capital around really focusing on the green assets and being very open in an investor friendly way to look at the portfolio.","So we\u2019ll continue to work that, but we\u2019ll do it in a smart way.  We\u2019ll do it in an investor friendly way.  Again, I think if you go back to the question Jeff asked earlier, total EPS is a metric, how we allocate capital is a metric, and industrial percentage of earnings is a metric, total CFOA is a metric.  So we\u2019re going to drive value around all four of those metrics as we look at it going forward.  But we expect to have a good year industrially this year.","Keith Sherin ","And you look at capital, we ended the quarter at $402 billion of [any].  It\u2019s down $32 billion from last year.  There\u2019s not a lot of huge transactions in there.  We\u2019re continuing to run off.  We\u2019ve got over $60 billion of noncore assets.  We continue to run those off.  The real estate gain enabled us to add to the current real estate plan.  Another $2 billion of equity assets that we expect to exit this year.","And so you\u2019re going to continue to see asset declines based on the red asset runoffs.  If we can get a little better GDP, a little higher growth in the CLL business, that would be great.  But right now you say that market continues to be relatively flat for asset growth, and we need a little better economy to see that pick up.  So right now I would expect that you\u2019re going to continue to see any declines in GE Capital.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of John Inch, Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","Just want to pick up on the capital issue.  What do you think is the dilution associated with capital downsizing, say in 2013, year over year, and obviously that includes some of the actions that you described based on the gains that you were opportunistically able to leverage this quarter?","Keith Sherin","Just on actual volume, if you took $35 billion at a 1.5% return, that would be a total year estimate of the loss margin, lost earnings that they have.  They offset some of that with cost.  Our new business volume has been at better returns.  But that will size it for you roughly.  If that\u2019s what you\u2019re asking.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","It is.  From an E&I context, E&I is going to drop sub-400, I\u2019m assuming, relatively quickly.  Where do you think it ends?  What\u2019s the trajectory, ultimately?  Is it you just subtract the 60 and you have some optionality around some of the other possible investments, like in offshore banks or some of the other stuff?  Or is there some other asset to that?","Keith Sherin ","The team is not trying to just have $60 billion of noncore assets go out and not grow the core business.  We\u2019re actually trying to remix, as you know.  So far, though, if you look at the last couple of years, our runoff in noncore has exceeded our remixing.  So it depends upon what that remixing looks like.  Right now we continue to be active in the market.  Our organic volume is low single digits.","And we have a lot of refinancing that has occurred.  We would like to acquire some portfolios.  If we could find the price to match our objectives on returns, we would do that.  So we have capacity, obviously.  We\u2019ve been shrinking and building up the equity.  But so far, if you just look at what\u2019s happened so far, the runoff of noncore has exceeded the remix into the green assets.  And we\u2019ll see what happens.","As we\u2019ve said in the framework discussions, big material portfolio moves are not part of the base plan.  But we\u2019re going to look at those opportunistically.  We do have some value maximizing franchises in the business, obviously, and if we had the opportunity to move some of those based on the market or buyers, or a better appetite, we would definitely evaluate those.","But right now the base plan is to continue to remix.  If you look at the last couple of years, the runoff has exceeded core growth.  And we\u2019ll see how that plays out.  And we do have opportunity on value maximizing.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","As a follow up, could you spend just a second on China?  It actually seemed to be one of the brighter spots in your quarter.  And China\u2019s obviously kind of within a recession last year.  What are you seeing today in your businesses there and the trajectory?  And if you could maybe put it in the context of price and orders and just how you\u2019re feeling about that market and its future contribution.","Jeff Immelt ","We had revenue up double digits last year, we had revenue up double digits in the quarter.  And we had orders that were up 60% plus, almost 70%.  So I always try to answer this that we are a composite of the businesses we\u2019re in, and not necessarily a reflection of everything.  So if you think about our three biggest businesses, which are aviation, healthcare, and power and water, all three of them are in a pretty good cycle right now.  Healthcare continues to grow strong double digits.  Healthcare was up 14.","Keith Sherin ","Aviation was up favorably.  They had $900 million of orders.  Oil and gas was a good quarter, up 76%.  Energy and power was down about 30.","Jeff Immelt ","[Cross talk] The gas tailwind, over time, with more gas turbine demand vis-\u00e0-vis coal and other fuels.  I think over the long term it\u2019s going to portend well.  So we think China will continue to be a good story.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank ","I guess the question is Europe, not just for GE but others, the down side surprised this quarter.  It sounds like China was a little bit of an upside surprise.  Do you think this trend is sustainable?  Or is there some kind of a first of year blip or aberration, because of the timing of who knows what?","Jeff Immelt ","I think our growth region story is still pretty strong.  Orders are up 17% overall.  We see this as more of a tailwind than a headwind for the year.","Keith Sherin ","I think you\u2019ve got to level-ize the 70% order rate.  We\u2019re planning on double digit order rates in China, and the start to the year gives us confidence that we\u2019ll have that for the year.","Operator","Your next question is coming from the line of Deane Dray, Citi Research.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","I was hoping to get some color on the updated restructuring plans for the balance of the year.  Your initial plan was the bulk was coming in in the second and third quarter.  I see some has slipped into the fourth quarter.  But just comment on the timing.  What are the areas you\u2019re able to talk about on the balance of these restructurings, the payback?  And we do recognize that these will be excluded from operating results because you\u2019ve had part of that gain slip through, or fall through, on the first quarter.","Keith Sherin ","That\u2019s right.  We\u2019ve tried to give you the profile.  And in the second and third quarter, it\u2019s really a function of getting all of the work complete to be able to meet the criteria required to do the accounting.  We have to have the plan finalized.  We have to take all the actions, including getting whatever approvals might be required of works councils or negotiating with unions that we have contractually in place.","And some of those things are just going to fold into the second, third, and fourth quarter.  And some of that money that\u2019s in the second, third, and fourth quarters is related to projects we\u2019ve already approved, it\u2019s just the timing of getting those expenses accrued on the restructuring will fall into those later quarters.","So the majority of it is going to be headcount, and plant closing, and site closings.  We continue to downsize our footprint, and as part of simplification, people are reducing the number of profit and loss centers across the company.  We are reducing the number of business sites, or consolidating into common lease facilities.  We\u2019re closing some of our older capacity plants.  You\u2019ve seen some of that in the U.S.  And consolidating it to different facilities that are more productive.","So we\u2019ve just got a tremendous amount of activity.  It\u2019s spread across the world.  It\u2019s probably about half in the U.S., and the rest spread between Europe and Asia, and a little bit in Latin America.  And it\u2019s substantially reductions in compensation and benefits and then facilities.  And the payback is about 18 months.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Just to switch gears to capital for a second, any reason that you\u2019d have to believe that the context is different in terms of thinking about the dividend announced, since that was made roughly in May last year, as you look out now?  Any reason to believe that things have shifted in a way such that we should be thinking about that differently in 2013 versus what happened in 2012?","Keith Sherin ","I don\u2019t believe so.  As you know, we\u2019re not one of the CCAR entities.  We do go through our own process that mirrors a lot of that activity, one on one, with our regulator.  We don\u2019t comment on any of those discussions.  We have done obviously stress tests and capital plans.  And we\u2019ll work constructively with them on that.  And our current expectation is that the timing would be similar to the last year and if that changes, we\u2019ll let you know.  But that\u2019s our current expectation.","Jeff Immelt ","The B&I is lower, and the ratios are better. GE Capital is in a very strong position right now.","Steve Winoker - Sanford Bernstein ","And just a minor question, but [unintelligible] had talked about $200 million of additional spend in the LEAP X and [Silver Crest], so it\u2019s obviously across two engines there.  I\u2019m just trying to equate your responsibility on the LEAP X side.  Have we seen whatever tick up there might be already?  Because they said that was additional spending that we\u2019re going to be doing going forward.  Have we seen that with you guys already?","Keith Sherin ","Well, you saw the R&D and aviation is up.  We do expect and have that in the run rate.  The tradeoff that we have is the Gen X spending on the [pit] programs comes down.  But aviation has been spending a lot of money.  In total, for R&D we expect it to be flat as a percentage of revenue for the business.  Aviation will probably be a little higher than the other businesses, and it\u2019s in line with all the new programs that they have.  As you saw, the LEAP, the Passport, the finish of the [pit] programs on the Gen X.","Operator","And the next question is from the line of Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Just a question on restructuring.  I think you mentioned that there is an 18-month payback on restructuring?","Keith Sherin ","That\u2019s right.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","So can you just talk about what was the margin cushion before NBC, your divestiture, right when you upped the restructuring targets?","Keith Sherin ","It was more than 70 basis points.  The restructuring obviously has added to it.  I don\u2019t have that broken out specifically.  A couple hundred million bucks, something like that.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","But from that perspective, that would flow into 2014 as well, right?","Jeff Immelt ","Yeah.  Look, like I said, we\u2019re going to, by \u201914, SG&A as a percentage of revenue, is going to be 15%.  We\u2019re on that path, and we\u2019re going to stay on that path.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And just a little bit more granularity as to which businesses you\u2019re going to do restructuring in throughout the year, how that will flow business by business for the year?","Keith Sherin ","I don\u2019t have it split by business.  I think it would be pretty similar to the profile that I gave you.  I gave you the dollars by business for the first quarter\u2019s restructuring.  I don\u2019t see any reason why we wouldn\u2019t have a little higher proportion in the power and water, energy management, and healthcare.  Those would be the three priorities.","Trevor Schauenberg ","Great.  We\u2019ve hit all the questions.  So just to close out today, the replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website.  We\u2019ll be distributing our quarterly supplemental data for GE Capital soon.","I have a couple of announcements regarding some upcoming investor events and dates.  Next Wednesday, April 24, is our 2013 annual shareholders meeting in New Orleans.  We hope to see you there.  On May 22, Jeff will present at the 2013 Electrical Products Group, EPG, conference.  On June 19, David Joyce and Norma Lu will host an analyst meeting in conjunction with the Paris Air Show.  And then finally, our second quarter 2013 earnings webcast will be on Friday, July 19.","So thank you everyone.

[Operator Instructions].My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew Cribbins","Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to GE's First Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. Presenting first today is our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; followed by our CFO, Jeff Bornstein. ","Before we start, I would like to remind you that our earnings release, presentation and supplementals have been available since earlier today on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. Please note that some of the statements we are making today are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes. ","And with that, I will turn it over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Matt. GE had a good quarter and a slow growth in a volatile environment. While the resource sector is challenging, we had the strongest Oil & Gas orders in 10 quarters. We saw global growth accelerating, while the U.S. continues to improve. Since the beginning of 2017, I visited China, Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. All are stronger than last year. With orders growth of 10%, we've seen attractive environment for GE overall. ","EPS was $0.21 for the quarter. Excluding the impact of uncovered restructuring, industrial EPS was up 15% and verticals grew by 20%. Organic revenue was up 7%, our strongest quarter in more than 2 years. Segment operating profit grew by 15% organically, and total industrial profit was up 20%. Margins are expanding, and our cost-out programs are accelerating. Our cash performance was worse than we expected to start the year with CFOA of $400 million and negative industrial CFOA. We had several one-timers and grew working capital on the first quarter, which we expect to turn around in the second quarter and be on plan for the year. ","We executed on our portfolio goals. The water sale exceeded our expectations and should produce a $2 billion gain and $2 billion of cash. ","GE Capital has exited PRA supervision, completing its pivot. This is an incredible accomplishment for the team. Two years after we announced our GE Capital strategy, our actions are largely complete. And Baker Hughes is on track for a midyear close. ","We're off to a strong start and are reconfirming our framework for the year. We're exceeding our goals for organic growth in margins. We expect to hit our goal for $1 billion of structural cost-out. And our plan is to be on track for cash and capital allocation for the year. ","Orders were very strong in the quarter, up 10%, which was 7% organically. Backlog grew by $3 billion. Equipment had a great quarter with growth of 11%. Services were strong as well with growth of 8%. Pricing was about flat. Orders growth was broad-based. We saw expansion in 6 of 7 segments in 9 of 12 regions. ","Let me give you a few order highlights that were particularly significant. Power equipment was up 25%. Growth markets were up 27%. Aviation spares grew by 25%. Healthcare equipment was up 10%. Life Sciences grew by 15%. Renewable service doubled. LED orders grew by 42%. We were encouraged that Oil & Gas orders grew by 9%. Global orders grew by 20% behind some very specific initiatives. Orders grew by double digits in 6 of 7 businesses. Highlights include, a big Kazakhstan rail deal; Aviation LEAP quarters of $250 million; a Power Wind in India worth $370 million. Global onshore wind deals were $270 million. Healthcare in China grew by 28%, and mining grew by 16%. Digital orders grew by 7%, including 70% growth in ServiceMax, 60% in Power, 55% in renewables and 41% in Oil & Gas. We continue to reposition our legacy IT businesses for growth in the future. We signed global deals at NEC, Bridgestone, South32 and Deutsche Bank. We established an alliance with China Telecom to bring Predix to China. We expect strong orders to accelerate through the year. So this start reinforces our organic growth goal of 3% to 5% for 2017. ","Organic revenue growth of 7% was ahead of expectations. Revenue strength was broad-based with 6 of 7 segments having positive organic growth. The old power businesses, as what you see as power and renewables, was exceptionally strong with both growing 18%. And Aviation grew by 8%. ","Our growth initiatives are paying off. Globalization is a major driver with growth market revenue expanding by 10%, where India was up 27%, Middle East up 12% and Africa up 77%. Services growth was up 8%, and 6 of 7 businesses expanded in the quarter. This was led by Aviation, up 18%, and repowering drove 84% growth in renewables. ","New products also added to growth. We finished the quarter with 30H turbines in backlog and 12,200 LEAP engine orders and commitments. Healthcare imaging orders in U.S. grew by 13% behind excellent new products. ","Digital revenue grew by 16%, led by power, oil and gas and renewables. The additional growth outside verticals doubled in the quarter. GE Store continues to work GE Capital's supported $2.2 billion of industrial orders and GE2GE orders grew substantially. ","Margins were also a good story. Industrial operating profit margins grew by 130 basis points with gross margins expanding by 90 basis points. Segment margins grew by 110 basis points. Efficiency was driven by a value gap, productivity and Digital Thread. This more than offset headwinds in mix. Corporate cost are ahead of plan, and we saw margin growth in both equipment and services. ","We're on track to reduce structural cost by $1 billion for the year. In the quarter, costs were down $76 million and $200 million lower than our original $500 million cost-out plan. We expect this to accelerate during the year. We invested $1 billion restructuring in the quarter. And for the year, we expect gains in restructuring to offset. We remain committed for $1 billion of cost out in '17 and $1 billion of cost out into '18. ","On cash, we have CFOA of $400 million. This included a dividend from GE Capital of $2 billion. Industrial CFOA was a negative $1.6 billion. There's no change to our 2017 framework of total CFOA of $18 billion to $21 billion and industrial CFOA of $12 billion to $14 billion. ","We built working capital in the quarter to support growth, and we're adjusting to a different profile with Alstom. And we're impacted by several one-timers. Cash is lumpy, and we expect to have a strong second quarter. I've asked Jeff to give you a little bit more context on cash flow in the next page. ","We received an additional $2 billion dividend from GE Capital on April, bringing the year-to-date total to $4 billion against the plan of $6 billion to $7 billion for the year, so a good start. Cash ended the quarter at $7.9 billion. We paid $2.1 billion of dividends and had $2.3 billion of buyback for a total of $4.4 billion return to shareholders. ","And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff to give you more details on cash and operations.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Thanks, Jeff. As Jeff said, we had a strong quarter on orders, revenues and margins. However, our industrial CFOA was at $1.6 billion usage of cash, about $1 billion below our expectations. We expect to see most of this come back over the remainder of the year, and we see no change for our outlook for the year of $12 billion to $14 billion of industrial CFOA. ","Walking the left side of the page. Industrial net income plus depreciation in the quarter was $1.5 billion. Working capital was a use of $1.3 billion. This was about $700 million higher usage than our expectation. The miss was mainly driven by power and renewables, partially offset by better performance in our Healthcare business. Receivables was a benefit of $200 million, about $400 million less than our plan. Operationally, we've seen improvement in collections. However, we didn't collect on a number of accounts in the quarter that we expected to. In Aviation, which historically has not had issues with past dues, we missed by about $200 million on 5 customer accounts, which will clear in the second quarter with no issue. In Power, we didn't collect on several delinquent accounts in top regions around the world, but we expect to collect these throughout the rest of the year, including in the second quarter. ","Inventory was a use of $800 million, about $100 million worse than we expected. Most of the businesses were right on the plan. The miss was driven by softness in the U.S. Healthcare market, particularly around ultrasound and LCS. But we expect to work off this inventory over the remainder of the year. ","Payables were a use of $400 million, roughly as we expected. This was driven by payments of fourth quarter purchases that were significantly higher than the new volume added in the first quarter. And we see this dynamic mostly every year in the first quarter. Progress collections was a use of $300 million. This is primarily driven by 2 things. First, it was the impact of renewables from shipping equipment in the first quarter following the buildup of progress collections from safe harbor wind turbines in fourth quarter. Secondly, we had several large orders in the quarter that did not reach financial closure. This includes large orders in Energy Connections in Iraq, a power deal in Algeria and a big transportation transaction in Angola. We expect these deals to close in the second and third quarter. ","Contract assets were a use of $1.9 billion. This was $300 million worse than expected. Of the $1.9 billion, $500 million was from our long-term equipment contract, where the timing of our $1 billion revenue recognition milestones differ. This will catch up throughout the year as we execute against the contract. The remaining $1.4 billion is our long-term service agreements. There were 2 pieces to this. $600 million is related to service contracts where we've incurred cost and booked the revenue, but haven't yet billed the customer. We expect this to partly come back over the year as we see higher asset utilization in Power and Aviation. ","And we've seen these similar trends in the prior years. The other $800 million are contract adjustments driven by better cost performance in park light, primarily driven by Power And Aviation. Versus expectations, the $300 million of lower cash on contract assets is driven by $200 million of long-term equipment contracts that we expect to come back throughout the year, and the $100 million from services contract adjustments I just walked through, which will come back over the remaining life of those contracts as we build the utilization. In total, we're about $1 billion off our first quarter plan, but we'll recover the vast majority over the second to the fourth quarter. ","In the first half of 2016, we delivered $400 million of CFOA. For 2017, we expect significantly stronger cash performance in the second quarter with sequential improvement throughout the year. Our total year plan is $12 billion to $14 billion. That's driven by an increase in net income plus depreciation. And we expect to see a benefit from working capital similar to last year's benefit. Contract assets will be similar impact as 2016. And other cash flows will be lower cash usage this year, largely driven by the absence of onetime [indiscernible] payment in 2016. So with that, I'll move on to consolidated results. ","Revenues were $27.7 billion, down 1% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were flat at $25 billion. As you can see on the right side of the page, the industrial segments were up 1% on a reported basis. Organically, industrial segment revenue was up 7%, affected by the Appliance disposition. Industrial operating plus vertical EPS was $0.21, flat with prior year. Excluding gains in restructuring, which was a $0.03 headwind versus the first quarter of last year, industrial operating verticals EPS was up 12%. Operating EPS was $0.14 in the quarter, up from $0.06 in the first quarter of last year. This incorporates other continuing GE Capital activity, including excess debt headquarter runoff costs that I'll cover separately on the capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.10 includes the impact of nonoperating pension. And net EPS of $0.07 includes discontinued operations. The total disc ops impact was a negative $0.03 in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exits that we executed in the quarter. The GE tax rate was 15%, in line with our total year mid-teens guidance. The GE Capital tax rate was favorable, reflecting a tax benefit on a pretax continuing loss. ","On the right side of the segment results, as I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and up 7% organically. 6 of the 7 businesses were positive organically with Power and Renewables up double digits. Industrial segment op profit was up 9%. And Industrial up profit, which includes corporate operating cost, was up 11%. On the bottom of the page, as I mentioned earlier, industrial operating income plus vertical EPS was $0.21, up 12%, excluding gains in restructuring with industrial operating EPS up 15% on the same basis. Included in the $0.21 was $0.08 of uncovered restructuring that I'll go through on the next page. ","So next on Industrial and other items in the quarter. As I said, we had $0.08 of charges related to industrial restructuring and other items that we're taken at corporate. Charges were $1 billion on a pretax basis with more than $300 million of Alstom synergy investments primarily related to power in Europe. We also made significant investments in corporate, Oil & Gas, Energy Connections & Lighting and Healthcare on the quarter. Restructuring charges totaled about $800 million, and BD charges were approximately $200 million related to Baker Hughes, the water disposition, the Industrial Solutions disposition and the digital acquisition. There were no gains in the quarter. ","For the year, we expect about $0.25 of restructuring to offset by $0.25 of gains from water and Industrial Solutions dispositions. We are targeting a third quarter close for the water transaction and a fourth quarter close for the Industrial Solutions transaction. For the second quarter, we expect to do about $0.07 of restructuring with no offsetting gains. ","Next, I'll cover the segments. I'll start with the Power businesses. Power orders of $6.1 billion were up 8%, with equipment higher by 25% and services flat. Equipment growth of 25% was driven by Gas Power Systems up 12% and steam power systems up almost 100%. Gas Power Systems was driven by higher arrow, up 20 units, and 10 more HRSGs versus last year. Gas turbine orders were down 13 units, 12 versus 25. We had orders for 2H units, including our first H in China. We have 30H units in backlog and expect to ship 23 Hs in 2017. ","Steam power systems recorded orders totaling $591 million, up almost 100%, primarily driven by 2 projects for which the business will provide coal-fired turbine islands. These orders were taken by an existing JV within Alstom, which we took majority control of in the quarter. ","Service orders were flat. Total orders for upgrades were up 34%, but the AGPs were down 5 units, 20 versus 25 a year ago. Offsetting upgrade growth was lower transactional services in Europe and the Middle East and lower new unit installation volume. ","Revenues of $6.1 billion were higher by 17%, with equipment revenue growing 59% and services revenue flat. Equipment revenue growth was driven by higher deliveries of gas turbines, HRSG and arrow units. We shipped 20 gas turbines versus 13 a year ago. In addition, we shipped 24 HRSGs versus 1 and 11 arrow units versus 5 compared with last year. H shipments were essentially flat at 4 units. ","Service revenues were flat despite strong upgrade regrowth, up 26%, including lower AGPs of 21 versus 27. Upgrade growth was offset by lower boilers service volume in North America and a fewer major outages in the Middle East, Africa and Europe. ","Power earned just under $800 million operating profit, up 39%. Performance was principally driven by cost productivity and equipment volume, offset partly by mix of equipment versus service. Gas Power Systems and steam-powered systems drove most of the improvement in profitability. ","Power had a good quarter, driving both equipment orders and equipment profitability. The business is intensely focused on structural cost and delivering $500 million of cost out for the year. Power had a very strong organic growth in the quarter on higher arrow turbines and higher gas turbine shipments, driving organic growth up 18%. Our view for the year of mid-single-digit order book unit growth has not changed. Power is on track for 100 to 105 gas turbines in 2017 and expect to deliver the upgrade growth, including 155 to 165 AGPs. No change to the outlook that the business provided in the March Investor Meeting. ","On Renewables, the business had a solid quarter. Orders of $2.1 billion grew 8%, with onshore wind higher by 4% and hydro orders up 39%. Onshore wind orders were up on $167 million of repower commitments versus none last year. The strength in repower was partially offset by lower wind turbine orders, down 8%. We took orders for 589 units versus 716 units last year, down 18%, but the megawatts for the units order grew by 3%. The lower unit cost was driven by the U.S., which down 61% after a very strong fourth quarter, partially offset by a very strong international growth, up almost double. The wind market is very competitive with pressure on price, both in U.S. and globally. ","Hydro secured a few large equipment orders in Turkey and Nigeria for 8 Francis turbines. Backlog grew 8% year-over-year to $13.4 billion. Renewables revenue of $2 billion grew 22%, driven by onshore wind up 11% and hydro up 2x. Onshore wind growth was largely driven by repowering deliveries. Wind turbine shipments were down 15%, 567 turbines versus 668 a year ago. However, the megawatts that we shipped were essentially flat on the larger turbines. ","Operating profit grew 29% in the quarter, driven by cost-out actions on the 2-megawatt NPI, positive value gap and repowering for volume, partially offset by higher NPI spend on the new 3-megawatt turbine. Margins expanded 20 basis points in the quarter. The business made good progress on the 2.x megawatt NPI unit cost, but will require additional cost actions given the competitiveness in the market. We are early in the learning curve and on the cost-out processes on the 3-megawatt NPI. ","We closed the LM acquisition this week, and the vertical integration will enhance the business ability to drive cost performance and growth. ","In Aviation, before I discuss the first quarter results for the business, I want to make you aware of a change we've made to how we report our aviation spares rate. Historically, we provided an all-in spares rate that included external shipments of spares, spares using time and material shop visits and spares consumed in shop visits for our engines under long-term service agreements. Going forward, our spares rate will only include externally shipped spares and spares used in time and material shop visits. Over the past several years, the strong growth in our long-term services agreements and the associated shop visits has driven the percentage of spares used in LTSA to be a much greater proportion of the historical order and sales rate.","These spares are also part of the LTSA billing and are already accounted for in revenues. We believe the new spares rate provides investors with more visibility to transactional market dynamics. Consumption of spares in long-term service agreements can be impacted by customer fleet management, optimization shop visits over the life of the contract over various other reasons. Starting with the first quarter of '17, we will report only a ship rate for spares on this new basis as the orders and shipments are virtually the same. This change does not impact any reported financial operation. Historical information for spares rate on the new basis, as well as the old mapping, are included in the supplemental presentation material. ","Moving to Aviation's first quarter performance. The business continues to execute well on a strong market. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 7% year-to-date February, with strength in both domestic and international routes. Air freight volumes increased 7.2% until February. Orders in the quarter were $7.4 billion with equipment up 5%. Commercial engine orders were up 3% on higher LEAP and GEnx, partially offset by lower GE90 and CF6 orders. $1.7 billion of new commercial engine orders included $932 million for LEAP, $206 million for CF34, $138 million for GE90 and $166 million of GEnx orders. CFM orders were also up 13% to $186 million. ","Military equipment orders of $169 million were down 46%, driven by no repeat of a large Black Hawk T700 armory order from last year. Service orders grew 17%. Commercial service orders were higher by 18% with CSA growth of 20% and the spares ADOR of $21.7 million a day was up 25% on the new basis. Military service orders were up 40% at $610 million on increased spare parts. ","Backlog finished the quarter at $158 billion, up 3%. The equipment backlog of $33 billion, down 5%, and service backlog of $125 billion ended up 5%. ","Revenues grew 9% in the quarter to $6.8 billion. Equipment revenues were down 2%, driven by military down 47% on lower shipments, partially offset by commercial growth of 12%. Commercial engine deliveries were down 7%. However, revenue was up driven by increased mix to higher-value GEnx and LEAP engines. Service revenues were up 17%, driven by commercial spares rate of $21.7 million a day, up 25%. Again, the same as the [indiscernible] order rate. Op profit in the quarter totaled $1.7 billion, up 10%, primarily driven by favorable price, volume and cost productivity, partly offset by a negative impact of 81 LEAP shipments versus 0 last year. ","Margins expanded 50 basis points in the quarter. Demand for the LEAP engine continues to be strong with over $900 million of orders booked in the quarter. The reliability and performance of spec of the 41 aircraft line with LEAP today has been excellent. The business is generating strong productivity to offset the negative mix impact of LEAP and is on track to report 2017 margin rates about flat with last year on continuing cost on programs. We will continue to ramp production to an expected 450 to 500 LEAP shipments for the year. ","The Oil & Gas environment has been improving led by increased activity in the North American onshore market. Rig count was up 70% versus prior year and up 25% from the fourth quarter of last year and has increased sequentially each of the last 3 quarters. External forecast continues to be slightly more positive on 2017 upstream spending, particularly among independents. The timing of recovery will vary by segment, and a large degree of uncertainty remains. Crude inventory remained at a 5-year highs, and markets are closely watching OPEC output work compliance. Offshore activity remains weak. ","Before I get into the dynamics of the quarter, just one item regarding Oil & Gas subsegment reporting. We combined the turbomachinery and downstream technology businesses, so I'll talk to the performance of those businesses on a combined basis. Orders for Oil & Gas of $2.6 billion were higher by 7% with equipment orders growing 30%. Every segment saw higher equipment orders. Turbomachinery and downstream grew 33%, surface up 10% and subsea up 52%. The equipment orders performance is a positive sign that growth is off a very low base. ","Service orders were down 2%, but flat organically. Turbomachinery and downstream was down 2%, digital solutions was down 3%, surface down 8% and subsea down 18%. Backlog ended the quarter at $20.4 billion, down 10% versus last year. Equipment backlog was down 32%, but service backlog actually grew 4%. ","Revenues in the quarter of $3 billion were down 9%. Equipment revenues were down 20% driven by subsea, down 29%, turbomachinery and downstream down 19% and surface down 2%. Service revenues were flat with turbomachinery and downstream up 13% and digital solutions up 1%, offset by subsea down 36% and surface down 14%. ","Operating profit of $207 million was lower by 33%, primarily driven by lower price and volume, partially offset by cost-out. The first half of '17 remains very challenging for the business. Despite positive equipment orders performance this quarter, our longer cycle equipment businesses in turbomachinery, downstream and subsea will lag the recovery on onshore. The team is focused on capturing growth opportunities and rebuilding its backlog. We continue to expect increased activity in our surface, digital solutions and transactional service businesses as we move into the second half of the year. The Baker Hughes deal remains on track to close midyear. We filed the draft S-4 with the SEC and continue to work with global regulators. Both the GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes team -- integration teams are making great progress toward the closing. ","Next up is Healthcare. Our Healthcare business had a solid quarter. Orders grew 7% versus last year and were up 8% on an organic basis. Geographically, organic orders grew 2% in the U.S., 5% in Europe and 21% in emerging markets. Emerging market growth was led by China, up 28%; the Middle East up 16%; and Latin America up 14%. ","On a product line basis, Healthcare Systems orders grew 5%, 6% organically, driven by growth in ultrasound up 10%, and imaging products up 12% with broad-based growth in MR and CT as well as mammo on successful NPI launches. Growth in HCS and ultrasound was partially offset by Life Care Solutions, which was down 8%, primarily driven by the U.S. general market uncertainty around reform. Life Science grew orders 15%, led by bioprocess up 25% and core imaging up 8%. Bioprocess growth was driven by an order for our QBO product in the quarter. ","Revenues in the quarter grew 3%, both on a reported and organic basis. Healthcare Systems revenues were higher by 3% versus last year, and Life Sciences revenue grew by 5%. Operating profit of $643 million was up 2% reported, but higher by 6% organically, driven by volume and productivity, partially offset by negative price and program and investments. FX was a $32 million profit drag in the quarter. Margins contracted 10 basis points on a reported basis, but were up 50 basis points, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. ","The business continues to execute well on new product introductions and driving cost productivity. Healthcare is targeting further product cost-out in line with the 2016 performance they delivered. They are focused on driving more competitors and sourcing, increasing the number of building factories and over 300 cost-out engineers dedicated to product competitiveness. Despite some uncertainty in the shorter cycle, lower ticket segment of the U.S. market around reforms, we believe the broad healthcare market supports our view of low to mid-single-digit organic revenue growth for the year. ","Next is transportation. Domestic market dynamics were slightly more positive, building on the modest improvement we saw in the fourth quarter. North American carload volume was up 4.4% in the quarter, driven by 2.2% growth in the intermodal carload space and 6.6% growth in commodity carload. Commodity carload growth was primarily driven by coal, which was up 15%, and agriculture higher by 4%. Petroleum continued its weakness, down 6%. In addition, GE parked locos were down 24% from last year and down 11% from year-end. Although these signs of improvement are important, they're off a weak base and, as of yet, have not signaled a consistent trend. ","Transportation orders for the quarter totaled $1.1 billion, up 70%. Equipment orders of $526 million were higher by 500%. We received orders for 37 locos and over 100 international kits versus no orders in the first quarter of last year. The 37 loco orders included 24 locos for North America. This is the first North American Tier 4 Class 1 order we've taken since 2014. Mining equipment orders were also higher. We received orders for 115 mining wheels versus 84 last year. ","Service orders of $582 million were up 3%. Backlog finished at $20 billion, down 5% versus last year, driven by equipment down 27%, partly offset by services up 4%. ","Revenues in the quarter were higher by 6%, with equipment up 15% and services down 1%. Locomotive deliveries were about flat year-over-year at 157 with a higher mix in international locos. North American locomotives were down 33%, while international locomotive shipments grew 159% driven by deliveries in Pakistan and South Africa. Op profit of $156 million was down 5% on unfavorable mix and higher digital investment, partially offset by cost productivity. No change to the outlook we shared with you in December. 2017 will be a challenging year with locomotive shipments likely down close to 50%, operating profit down double digits and pressure on margin run rates. The business continues to drive structural cost out as well as building their international backlog. ","Next on Energy Connections & Lighting. Orders for the segment totaled $2.6 billion, which were down 2%. Energy Connection orders of $2.4 billion were down 12%, driven by Power Conversion down 36% and Grid down 8%, partially offset by Industrial Solutions, which grew 11% in the quarter. Power Conversion performance was driven by continued pressure in Oil & Gas and no repeat of a large inverter order in the first quarter of last year. Grid's first quarter performance was impacted by orders delays in the Middle East that will close in the second quarter, specifically a large order in Iraq. Industrial Solutions, which was up 11%, outperformed versus the NEMA market, which was up an estimated 3% in the quarter. Our current platform had orders in the quarters totaling $243 million. ","Revenues for Energy Connections grew 1% reported and 4% organically. Grid grew 19%, partly offset by Industrial Solutions down 2% and Power Conversion down 26% organically. Current and lighting revenues were down 11% with current growing 3% and legacy business increasing by 22% as we exit markets and experience lower demand for older technology. ","Operating profit in the quarter of $28 million was substantially higher versus last year, driven by structural cost actions. Energy Connections earned $20 million, and current and lighting earned $8 million. No change in the 2017 outlook. We expect better execution from these businesses with double-digit profit growth for the year. We expect divestiture of Industrial Solutions to happen late in the year. ","Finally, I'll cover GE Capital. The verticals earned $535 million in the quarter, up 8% from the prior year, driven principally by lower impairments, higher tax benefits, partially offset by lower gain. GE cash, energy finance and industrial finance all had strong quarters, and overall portfolio quality remains stable. ","In the first quarter, the verticals funded $1.8 billion of unbooked volume and enabled $2.2 billion of industrial orders. Other continuing operations generated a $582 million loss in the quarter, driven by excess interest expense, restructuring cost related to portfolio transformation and headquarters operating cost. As I've said in the past, these costs will continue to come down as excess debt matures and we rightsize the organization. Versus the first quarter last year, other continuing cost are down $800 million, driven by these lower excess debt cost, non-repeat of cost associated with both the first quarter of '16 hybrid tender offer and the preferred equity exchange. In addition, we expect incremental tax benefits associated with the completion of the GE Capital restructuring towards the second half of the year. ","Discontinued operations generated $242 million loss, driven by exit plan-related items and operating cost. Overall, GE capital reported a net loss of $290 million. We ended the quarter with $167 billion of assets, including $43 billion of liquidity. Assets were down $16 billion from year-end. GE Capital closed on $7 billion of transactions in the quarter, including the sale of our French consumer finance platform and our Hyundai JV. In total, $198 billion has been actioned since April of 2015, $263 billion, including the spinoff of Synchrony. All major sales activity related to GE Capital exit plan is now complete. $8 billion of assets remaining will largely be runoff over the next 12 to 18 months. As a result of this, as of March 30, GE Capital's non-U.S. activities are no longer subject to consolidated supervision by the U.K.'s PRA. ","GE Capital paid $2 billion of dividends during the quarter and an additional $2 billion this week. We remain on track for $6 billion to $7 billion of dividends for the total year. Overall, the GE Capital team delivered a strong performance from the verticals, while executing on all aspects of our exit plan. ","And with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Jeff. We are reconfirming our 2017 operating framework and we should meet all of our goals for operating EPS. We're off to a good start on organic growth and margins. The goals for industrial operating profit and structural cost-out are in sight. Despite a slow start, we plan to hit $12 billion to $14 billion of industrial CFOA for the year. We believe that capital dividend should be $6 billion to $7 billion for the year. Dispositions are on track. We're on track to return $19 billion to $21 billion to investors through dividend and buyback. ","So to recap, we had 10% orders growth, 7% organic growth, 130 basis points of margin expansion and 20% organic industrial operating profit growth, and a commitment to hit CFOA for the year. So this is a good start. ","Matt, now for some questions.","Matthew Cribbins","Thanks, Jeff. With that, let's open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. The first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis","I wanted to talk about the cadence of the cost out. I'd get to like a $230 million number in 1Q. I think that's what you said. I would assume, if you did that every quarter, you get to your $2 billion pretty -- on a kind of steady cadence. But the point is you commented that, that would ramp a little bit faster through the year. So how do you think about that $2 billion? Is that something that comes out steady over 2 years? Or is that something where you can front-end load a fair amount of it?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes, okay.","Scott Davis","And just on that, if you can give a little bit of color on how much of that cost-out is really from last year's restructuring versus new cost initiatives.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. So what we're talking about is structural cost or base cost, so fixed cost exclusive of variable cost. We talked about $2 billion of cost out, $1 billion each in '17 and '18. So the goal this year is to take $1 billion of that base cost out. If you go to the supplement, we do a walk-through in the first quarter. So in the first quarter, those costs year-over-year were down about $75 million. Now beneath that, we took out over $375 million of those costs. And that was partly offset by a couple hundred million more as we expected a higher digital spend year-over-year and just wage inflation of about $80 million. So good underlying performance there. It's going to accelerate over the year because we take an enormous number of actions here in the first quarter across all of the businesses and corporate.","We talked about the effort around horizontal IT, which, we think, is worth $250 million in the year, what we just announced around the tax -- corporate tax team and that transition to PWC. We've kind of taken a number of headcount actions, both at corporate and across the businesses here in the first quarter. So we expect that to grow over the course of the year. The other reference points I'd give you is when we talk to the outlook meeting, we talked about 500 -- a goal of $500 million with which we had $1.7 billion kind of pipeline against. Against that original plan, the first quarter were $200 million better than that original plan, so that gives us confidence that we're on track for the higher plan of $1 billion for the year.","So I think you'll continue to see a better performance here in the second quarter. And then I think you'll see a real acceleration in the second half of the year. To answer your question on restructuring from prior year, so within this bucket of cost, I said we took out $375 million before digital and the effect of EOP -- effect on wages. About $174 million of that $375 million was from prior-year restructuring actions.","Jeffrey Immelt","But I would say, Scott, having a good 130 basis point of margin with a lot of the structural cost totally kick in makes us feel good on the 100 basis point goal for the year on margins.","Scott Davis","Right. And I know you're focused on the base fixed cost. On the variable cost, how does that play into the next several quarters?","Jeffrey Bornstein","So as we talked about -- let's go back to what we said at outlook. At outlook, we talked about a goal of 100 basis points of margin improvement. And we said 50 of that was going to come from everything we're doing around restructuring, et cetera. Then the incremental cost plan was going to deliver the next 50 basis points. If you look at gross margins in the quarter, we were better by 90 basis points. So gross margins is all products and service cost. So that's a good down payment against delivering the total year margin.","Jeffrey Immelt","And I would say, again, on gross margin, Scott, we built in kind of a negative mix, vis-\u00e0-vis, the LEAP and things like that. And we still can more than offset that with other strong programs we've got in the company.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey Sprague","Could we just explore a little more what's going on in Alstom? There was a comment about you're taking a different profile there. It was unclear what you meant by that. And it also sounds like one of the JVs got consolidated in the quarter.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. Expand on your first -- I'm not sure I understood your first question, Jeff. Okay. So let me just talk about the JV, and then I'll let Jeff talk about the first part of your question. When we did the Alstom acquisition, as part of that, we acquired an interest in the JV in the steam space in India. And we were a minority shareholder. So we spent a little bit of -- an insignificant amount of money to actually gain control of ship -- or control of that JV in India. So in the steam space, it's around steam equipment. It largely services India.","Jeffrey Immelt","And then Jeff, the comment I made is the profile of Alstom was always very highly skewed towards their last quarter. It's going to take a while to get that normalized on the kind of the GE time frame just based on some of the EPC work and project work they do. So that was the comment that I made.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. I don't think that the profile is materially different than our own business. We have a lot of long-term contracts, 81 long contracts that's [indiscernible] we're really building against those here in the first quarter. Those will hit billing milestones over the course of the year. And like our own equipment businesses, the Alstom equipment businesses will improve on cash performance throughout the year.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","So obviously, order growth inflected pretty possibly in the quarter. And we know you have your management incentives in line toward delivering significant cash flow. So why isn't cash better? Why not maybe you're going to sacrifice some orders from difficult customers if you have to for better cash or maybe pressure suppliers even harder to generate more cash? I guess, the question I'm trying to figure out is whether your issues are transient and cyclical, which, we think, they are or sometimes, people think they're structural, especially in Power. How would you answer that question?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, when you look the first quarter performance, we talked about being $1 billion lower than our expectations, $700 million of that in working capital. And within that $700 million, $400 million really is related to receivables. Our receivables performance actually was pretty good in the quarter. Our collection, in fact, was better year-over-year. We did factor $1.3 billion last versus the first quarter of last year, but we expected to do that. It was really around the accounts I talked about. In Aviation, which we had a couple of hundred million of past dues that we don't normally experience in Aviation, those are already clearing here in the second quarter.","And then some big past dues in the Middle East in our power business that are on schedule. They -- we will collect the majority what we expect to collect in the first quarter. We'll do that in the second quarter. Then we had a small kind of $100 million kind of miss in inventory versus our own expectations. Interestingly, across most of the businesses hit their inventory expectation. And our inventory performance year-over-year was $700 million better than the first quarter of last year. That's important because when we think about our working capital, we talked about $3 billion-plus of working capital improvement in the year to get to $12 billion to $14 billion, a big part of that is driven by inventory. Last year, we're really helped by progress in AP. This year, it's about receivables and inventory. So getting off to a $700 million better outcome year-over-year on inventory is good. ","But it was $100 million less than we thought it would be and that was all about Healthcare in North America. And that will liquidate -- that's mostly timing around sales and orders. So we're not too concerned about that. And then progress, there's a couple hundred million light versus what we expected. It was a $300 million use in the quarter. A big part of what drove that was we took enormous amounts of progress in the fourth quarter of last year in Renewables around U.S. onshore wind and people getting ahead of the PTC. We -- now we're shipping against that progress. So we're liquidating the progress. We collected the cash fourth quarter. ","Now we're revenue recognition -- we're rev rec-ing and shipping those units. And the majority of that cash was collected last year. Having said that, we have some really big orders, particularly in the Middle East, that we thought we're going to get to financial close in the first quarter. It looks like that most those will get to financial close in the second quarter. I talked about earlier the big grid order in Iraq. I think we feel really good about that. i think next week, we're likely going to announce, which is -- was part of this progress news the biggest service deal in the history of our power services business in the Middle East. A really phenomenal transaction. We thought it was going to close a couple of weeks early. It's going to close next week, we believe. So we feel good about that. And then some progress we expect to collect out of West Africa, which will happen in the second quarter. ","So we were $1 billion off in those buckets versus what we expected. I think we feel good about how we move from where we are today to the $12 billion to $14 billion we talked about for the year. So if you just go back, I'm just trying to give you a framework on how to think about it. Listen, we committed to $17.2 billion of pretax operating profit. So using that as a baseline, from here, we see $12 billion-plus of net income plus depreciation between the second and fourth quarter. We expect to generate about $4.5 billion roughly of working capital improvements 2Q through 4Q. That's about on par with what we did in 2016. It's within $100 million to $200 million of what we actually did execute in 2016. Again, inventory, a big piece of that.","We expect contract assets to be a drag here and the next 3 quarters of about $2 billion. For the total year, that would put us at about $3.9 billion. That is equivalent to what contract assets did in 2016. So at the moment, we're not planning anything better or worse. And then in other operating cash, which we give you a lot more disclosure in the K, we see that as a positive for the year, largely because we had the long-term incentive plan payout last year. We won't have that this year. And that's how we get to a framework of $12 billion to $14 billion. We're also looking for some of that big base cost structure we're taking out to fall through the cash as well. So we're taking $1 billion of cash. That should be virtually all cash as well. It will show up in the net income plus depreciation line. So that's a little bit of a cash hedge here on execution for the year.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa","So when you look at the noncash earnings from contract assets, how is that reported in the margin bridge? And then on the restructuring, with the $800 million of restructuring and other, is there anything in there that's not pure payback kind of headcount restructuring? And if so, what's the volume of that? I think you had a disclosure in your 10-K around that -- around the breakout of restructuring.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Well, no, Steve, the $800 million of restructuring in the quarter is just that. It's restructuring. So it's projects with paybacks. So -- and they are very much structured. When I say structure, I mean headcount and site capacity-related. So I'll give you some detail around it. $800 million of restructuring. About $500 million of that is really related to workforce capacity, okay, $500 million of $800 million. ","We got about $300 million, roughly, that's associated with plant capacity, consolidating footprint, et cetera. And then on -- the balance to get to $1 billion charge in the quarter is $200 million of BD. And that's really all Baker Hughes, water, industrial systems and some of the digital acquisitions we closed in the quarter. So to answer your question, $800 million is all investment with payback. Ask your first part of your question again.","Jeffrey Immelt","Okay. It's on the contracts.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. So contracts in the quarter are -- so on the CSA contracts, which is, I think, what you're talking about, CSA contracts in the quarter were up $1.4 billion year-over-year. $800 million of that increase was associated with contract updates, okay? And that's versus $500 million a year ago. So it's higher by $266 million year-over-year. Of the about $300 million, it's up year-over-year, a little more than half of that is in power. And most of that is associated with updates of part cost when we change standards every year. So for the contracts that were under review in the first quarter, if we change the standard on the part cost and deliver against that contract for the future, we did that update. And then there's a small update for escalation that's mostly around our Aviation business. We update it once a year on escalation within the service contract.","That part of long-term contracts that are revenues versus billing, so outside of contract updates was $600 million in the first quarter. And that's really where we've incurred shop visits, outages. We've incurred cost against those service contracts ahead of actually billing the hours or the events associated with it. So that's mostly timing. And some of that will come back over the course of the year, as we actually bill against the utilization or bill against an outage or a shop visit. So I would say that's mostly timing. That's the $1.4 billion increase that you see in contracts year-over-year.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell","Just one other quick question on the -- back to the cash flow. So Jeff Bornstein, I think you'd called out that $400 million of industrial CFOA in the first half of last year. Was the implication that we should assume the first half of this year is around the same level? And then also, my follow-up would just be on the contract assets piece. You've had outflows last year of about $4 billion in cash. It's about $4 billion out this year. Before that, in 2014 and '15, it was more like $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year. So I just wondered, with GE today, as you look out beyond this year, what's the normalized contract assets cash outflows we should expect annually?","Jeffrey Bornstein","So let me take part 2 first. So yes, we expect the contract drag on cash flow for the year to be roughly the same, '16 versus '17, as you said, at about $3.9 billion. I think you got a number phenomena that's going on. We're investing like crazy in productivity and cost-out. Whether that's additive, value-engineering, driving these plant closures, restructuring, all of this finds its way into lower cost. When we get lower cost, the cost to execute against our contracts improves. And when they improve, the accounting has to account for that and where it changes our view on the ultimate profitability of these contracts. That's one method in where it's hugely focused on that.","And I think you want to focus on to that, that's all future cash, future economics, et cetera, on a go-forward basis. We're not pulling future profit for it. That is not what we're doing. We're just restating what -- where we are in the contract from inception to date. The second part is where the long-term service agreements that protect our install base, and our penetration continues to improve. When you look at the attach rate on the H turbine, on the LEAP engine, the population and our backlog around this contract is growing substantially and has over the last number of years. And so there's a volume factor associated with it as well. What was the first part?","Jeffrey Immelt","I think on the -- I think it's the half we expect CFOA to be roughly comparable...","Jeffrey Bornstein","So yes. What I would say on the half, we think CFOA is going to be sequentially much better in the second quarter than the first. And we would expect year-over-year CFOA to be better to the half, equal or better to the half.","Operator","And the next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan","So power equipment orders up 25% in the quarter when gas turbines were down about 50%. I mean, it seems to support this shift you've been talking about from gas turbine sales to power island sales and the expanded scope. You also have pretty easy comps in Alstom. So I'm just -- I just want a little color on the sustainability of that kind of equipment order strength in power despite kind of a weaker gas turbine outlook.","Jeffrey Immelt","Look, I think, Shannon, we look at the total gas turbine market probably being roughly flat year-over-year. We do think this increase content is kind of here to stay. So it's our expectation that, that continues through the year. And then I think, at the end of the day, we've got a decent competitive position in steam. We don't have any false expectations about that market, but we will pick up some orders there as well.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Just to give you a little bit of color. So -- and I talked about it earlier. We laid a 2 big steam turbine island orders in the quarter, which is usually positive. We were much stronger on arrow units in orders in the quarter. We were up 20 year-over-year on arrow derivatives. And we took 10 more HRSG orders out of Alstom in the quarter than we did a year ago. And as you mentioned, we're down 13 gas turbines. So a little broader strength in just about gas turbine.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin","Just a question in terms of progression of organic growth through the year, how much of first quarter growth was pulled from the fourth quarter '16 shortfall and whether any orders or revenues pull from the second quarter and the rest of the year?","Jeffrey Immelt","Again, certainly, there was going to be some spillover from Q4 into Q1. I still think 3% to 5% is the right way to peg the year. We're encouraged about how the first quarter started. And I would say, Andrew, business outside the U.S. is incrementally better than we had expected, I think, when we lined up the year. So I think there's some macro drivers that are also important in terms of our ability to capitalize on the year. And then I think 10% orders growth is a nice bellwether for investors to reinforce, I think, what our guidance is for 2017.","Jeffrey Bornstein","The only thing I'd add to that, Andrew, is at year-end, we talked about power, that we had some short ships as we expect at gas turbines, both arrows and units. We expect -- as we said on the call, we expect those to close here in 2017. We think those are good projects. Those did not close in the first quarter. So to answer your question, the orders performance you saw on the first quarter, particularly around power that we talked about from year-end, those units are not in the first quarter.","Operator","That was our final question. I'll turn it back to you, Matt, for any closing remarks.","Matthew Cribbins","Thank you. The replay of today's call will be available this afternoon on our Investor website. We remind you that next Wednesday, we'll be holding our Annual Shareholder Meeting in Nashville, North Carolina. And Jeff, you're going to speak at EPG Conference on May 20. With that, Jeff?","Jeffrey Immelt","Great, Matt. And I would just spike out, I think people were very encouraged by first quarter performance, 10% orders growth, 7% organic, 130 basis points of margin. I think a solid cash profile for the year. So I think, Matt, off to a great start. I think very encouraged by 2017.","Matthew Cribbins","Great. Thanks for joining today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Shaquana, and I will be your conference coordinator today. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Trevor Schauenberg, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed sir?","Trevor Schauenberg","Thank you, Shaquana. Good morning and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today's third quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release as well as the presentation slides at 6:30 this morning, which is something new for us. Slides are also available for download and printing on our website at www.ge.com\/investor.","As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light. For today's webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt and our Senior Vice Chairman and CFO, Jeff Bornstein.","Now, I would like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Great, Trevor. Thanks and good morning, everyone. You know what? GE had a good third quarter in an improving environment. Our orders grew 19% with great balance. Our growth markets were up 22%, the U.S. was up 18% and Europe up 17%.","Earnings per share was up 18% ex-unusual items, industrial earnings growth 11% with six or seven segments growing all by double digits. Capital continues to execute on our strategic objectives. Earnings were up 13%, while our financial position continued to strengthen and we had $0.04 of uncover charges in the quarter and no industrial gains.","Operations were very strong. Our margins grew by 120 basis points behind strong value gap performance in simplification. Our industrial cost out reached to $1 billion through the third quarter and we are significantly ahead of our plan and CFOA is up 5% operationally. This includes a $3.9 billion dividend from GE Capital year-to-date.","We have returned about $14 billion to investors year-to-date, well on our way to our $18 billion goal. At that the same time, we continue to invest in strategic acquisitions like, Avio and Lufkin, so overall this was a good quarter for GE team.","Our orders were highlight for the quarter. Overall growth was up 19% with strength in equipment and services. Every business grew and backlog reached $229 billion, equipment orders grew 32% with strength across the board and orders price was flat.","The orders profile is very encouraging. Services was up 5%, with real strength in power gen services and aviation commercial spares. Total orders in the U.S. and Europe were both robust and seven growth regions had double-digit orders growth.","These include Australia, Canada, Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, up 17%. Africa up 18%, Russia up 51%, China up 18% and ASEAN up 100%. Power & Water had a solid orders performance with growth 19%, and though this number did not include any orders from Algeria. Those will be booked into fourth quarter in 2014. Orders growth in backlog supports business expansion fourth quarter through 2014.","While we are making progress on our strategic growth initiatives, growth market revenues were up 13% with six of nine regions up double digits. This remains a key strength for the company due to our geographic diversity and strong share position. Services grew by 7% with margins up 60 basis points and aviation spares shipments grew by 25%.","Last week, we had our second Minds and Machines summit, where we announced 40 new service offerings in analytics and software. Our industrial Internet order should exceed $500 million for the year and we continue to drive our technical advantage. We announced 8-gigawatt, heavy duty, gas turbine wind in Algeria.","We will launched 50 healthcare NPIs for the year and we are gaining share. The LEAP engine is ahead of schedule and the GE9x recorded its first order and is well positioned for the Boeing 777 launch. We have the only locomotive to meet the Tier-4 standard and we continue to launch new appliance products with strong acceptance in retail and contract channels. With a strong backlog and good growth initiatives, I think we are well positioned for solid organic growth in the fourth quarter in 2014.","On margins, look, we are encouraged about our progress. GE's margins grew by 120 basis points in the quarter and were up 40 basis points year-to-date. Five of seven businesses grew margins in the quarter and all are flat or up for the year, excluding the impact of acquisitions.","Our results are [problematic] and sustainable. Our value gap is positive $660 million year-to-date and will continue to grow. We have achieved our $1 billion simplification goal in only three quarters and will drive substantial upside for the year and there will be no industrial gains in this quarter.","Our Power & Water had a solid quarter with improved mix, strong value gap and good simplification efforts and they should sustain this momentum into the fourth quarter. So on track to achieve our 70 basis points goal. Our results and service margins, value gap and simplification are accelerating and all businesses should have positive margin growth in fourth quarter and we still have a slight hedge in out plan.","On cash, we had a solid quarter. For cash, our industrial CFOA has grown by 5% year-to-date ex the NBCU deal related taxes which show in CFOA. We are still targeting to receive up to $6.5 billion of GE Capital dividends paid to the parent. We remain on track to achieve our $14 billion to $17 billion CFOA goal for the year. We have significantly higher revenues in fourth quarter than third quarter driving higher CFOA by year-end and our balance sheet remains extremely strong with $87 billion of consolidated cash.","Our capital allocation remains disciplined and balanced. Year-to-date, we have $13.9 billion to investors in dividends and buyback. We have invested $8.6 billion in acquisitions that will improve our long-term growth rate. We are on track to return $18 billion to investors in 2013.","Now over to Jeff to review operations.","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks, Jeff. I will start with third quarter total results. Revenue from containing operations of $35.7 billion was down 1% from last year. Industrial sales of $25.3 billion were up 2% driven principally by oil and gas and aviation, partly offset by Power & Water, as you can see on the right side of the page. GE Capital revenues were down 5% to $10.7 billion on much lower investment. Operating earnings of $3.7 billion were down 3% and operating earnings per share was flat at $0.36. That includes $0.02 for the Avio acquisition charges and $0.02 of restructuring in the quarter. We also no longer have earnings from the NBCU JV which was $0.02 in the third quarter 2012. I will cover these items on the next page.","Continuing EPS of $0.32 includes the impact of non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes discontinued operations which I will also cover on the next page. Adjusted CFOA, year-to-date, was $7.8 billion with solid industrial performance and $2 billion GE Capital dividends were paid in the quarter. The GE tax rate in the quarter was 20% and the GE Capital tax rate was zero. GE Capital continued the benefits associated with loss recapture in real-estate and tax efficient asset reductions.","In the second quarter, we said that we expect the GE capital tax rate to be in the mid single-digits for the year but that could be lower depending upon higher IRS solutions that could happen in the fourth quarter as well as expected dispositions in the fourth quarter which could impact tax rates.","On the right side of the page, segment results were positive. Industrial segment profit was up 11% with six of seven industrial segments improving. GE Capital also had a positive quarter growing earnings 13% versus 2012.","I will cover all the segments in more details on the following pages. So for one time items, in total we had $0.04 of charges in the quarter, $0.02 related to Avio as we discussed in September. Avio had a number of preexisting contractual arrangements with GE Aviation and U.S. GAAP requires us to record the fair value impact of effectively settling those preexisting contracts.","We also had an inventory fair value adjustment in the quarter. These resulted in $0.02 charge. Going forward, we will benefit from the efficiencies that Avio has achieved over time. We also had $0.02 of restructuring and other charges as we continue to take actions to reduce our cost structure. This was $0.01 higher than we had originally planned for the third quarter as we continued to identify track the projects that will lower structural cost and rationalize our footprint.","On the right side of the page, we included a walk from reported to adjusted operating results. In the third quarter of 2012, we earned $0.36 which included $0.02 of income related to NBC. In the third quarter of this year, we earned $0.36 that, as discussed that included $0.02 of the Avio related charges and $0.02 of restructuring. If you adjust for those items, operating EPS is $0.40 in third quarter of '13 versus $0.34 in third quarter of '12 up 18%.","For discontinued operations, we had an $82 million after tax impact in the quarter, driven by GE Money Japan. We booked $79 million of additional reserves to reflect ongoing claims related to gray zone. We ended the quarter with $527 million in total reserves. There were really no material change in WMC in the quarter, with a very slight reserve adjustment.","On the bottom of the page is a summary of our operating EPS and the industrial NBC gains and restructuring, with $0.02 of restructuring charges in the third quarter, that brings our year-to-date to a net zero impact between the first quarter gains and year-to-date restructuring.","With that I begin covering our business results and we will start with Power & Water. Orders of $5.9 billion were up 19%, European orders were up 9%, led by renewables and water. However PGS was down 18%.","Equipment orders were 37% higher at 3 billion. Thermal orders were 886 million, down 15%. The business had orders for 27 heavy duty gas turbines in the quarter versus 29 a year ago.","Renewable orders were strong, up over a 100% to $1.2 billion with continuing strength in the U.S. Distributed power was also strong with orders of $700 million, up 62% driven by aero demand.","Service orders were up 4% to $2.9 billion, up 7% excluding Europe. Despite continuing European softness, PGS orders were up 8% to $1.8 billion and we booked 15 advanced gas path upgrades versus four year ago.","Overall, orders pricing was down 80 basis points driven by equipment, down 2.9%, partially offset by services, up 1.4%. [Thermal] was down 1.4% and wind was down 1.2%. Revenue of $6.5 billion was down 10% driven by lower volume. Equipment revenue was down 13% on lower gas and wind volume.","We shipped 22 gas turbines versus 35 in the third quarter of 2012, and we shipped 407 fewer wind turbines, down 40%. This was partially offset by distributed power strength, up 44% with 76 unit deliveries versus 48 a year ago.","Service revenue of $2.8 billion was down 5% driven by PGS down 6%. Higher AGP volume was offset by lower new unit spares. Segment profit of a $1, 289 billion was up 9% in the quarter. The improvement was driven by positive value gap and distributed power strength and better cost performance.","SG&A was down 10% in the quarter and margins improved 330 basis points. Oil and gas orders were $4.4 billion, up 4%. Equipment orders were $2.3 billion, up 3%. We saw a strong turbomachinery orders growth of 17% led by a large midstream LNG order in Russia. The Lufkin orders of $243 million, partially offset by subsea down 41%. Subsea orders tend to be very lumpy and are up 17% over the last 12 months.","Service orders grew 6% in the quarter, drilling and surface was up, 21%, subsea up 27%, partially offset by measurement and control, down 8%. Total backlog was up 35% versus prior year and orders pricing was down 20 basis points with year-to-date remaining positive and up 70 basis points.","Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 18%, up 9% ex-acquisitions, equipment was up 19% driven by subsea, up 16%, the drilling and surface up 13% offset by measurement and control down 3% in the quarter.","Measurement and control was a disappointment in the quarter as we saw continued softness in the market. Service revenues grew 18% with strength in Global Services, up 13%, subsea up 43% and drilling and surface up 23%.","Segment profit of $519 million was up 11%. That's up 7% ex-acquisitions, primarily driven by higher volume and a strong value gap. Margins were down 90 basis points on a reported basis, down 30 basis points excluding the impact of the Lufkin in the quarter. This was lower than expected primarily driven by a software measurement and control market and there were some project delays.","With that we will talk about the aviation and healthcare. First aviation. Aviation had another really strong quarter orders of $7.8 billion were up 51% with equipment orders up 92%.","Commercial engine orders were $3.8 billion, up four times led by $1.6 billion of CFM orders, up nine times including $1.4 billion of LEAP orders. GE90 orders were $1.2 billion also up four times. Military orders continued their expected weakness, down 30%.","Service orders of $2.7 billion were up 9%, commercial service orders were up 15%. The average daily order rate for commercial spares was $24 million, up 9% in the quarter. Our fleet utilization year-to-date is up 3.1% and overhauls in the quarter were up 23%.","Military service orders fell 6% and flight hours continue to and de-stocking continues across the military. Orders pricing in the quarter was up 1.9% with improvements in both equipment and service. Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 12%, up 10% excluding Avio. Equipment revenue was 10% higher. We shipped 273 military engines, up 12%. We also shipped 559 commercial engines in the quarter, up 8% including 26 GenEx engines. Service revenues were 14% higher driven by strong spare part sales of $25.9 million a day which was up 25%. Military service revenue was down 17%.","Segment profit of $1.1 billion was up 18% driven by strong volume and value gap, with sales price up 3%. Margin rates improved a 100 basis points versus last year and we are up 70 basis points excluding Avio. Just as a note, Avio helped margins and Lufkin was a hurt on margins in the quarter. So overall acquisitions were about a 10 basis points drag in the quarter on segment margins.","Next is healthcare. Orders in healthcare of $4.7 billion were up 2%. Equipment orders were up 6% to $2.7 billion. Developed markets were up 1% driven by strong U.S. equipment orders up 8%. Europe was flat, Japan was down 24%, down 6% excluding the effect of FX. Emerging markets were up 14% driven by China, who are up 33%, Latin America up 28%, partially offset by Asia-Pacific down 16%.","Just a little bit on modality. HCS was up 5%, MR was up 13%, CT down 8% and ultrasound was very strong, up 14%. Life Sciences was up 10%, diagnostic guidance up 5%. So pretty good strength across the modalities.","Service orders of $1.9 billion were down 4%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was flat driven by growth markets up 5% led by China who are up 13%, offset by developed markets down 2%. Both the U.S. and Europe were up 2% offset by Japan. Segment profit of $665 million was higher by 7% as cost productivity from our restructuring efforts more than offset lower price. Margin rates expanded in the quarter 110 basis points.","Then moving onto transportation. Orders of $1.6 billion were up 34%. Equipment orders were up 65% driven by a large North American locomotive order for 275 units deliverable in 2014 and mining really continues to be soft. Services orders were 8% higher driven by solid growth in locomotive services probably offset by very week demand for mining parts. Revenues of $1.4 billion were flat, year-over-year and strong service growth of 17% was offset by equipment revenue down 14%.","Locomotive shipments were approximately flat, with the third quarter deliveries of 147 compared to 146 a year ago. Operating profit of $306 million was up 15% with margins better by 300 basis points. The improvement was principally driven by positive value gap in services growth.","Energy management. Orders of $2 billion were up 16% with strengthened power conversion up 19%, digital energy up 23% and intelligent platforms up 16%. Backlog of $4.6 billion is up 29% versus prior year. Despite the order strength, operations were disappointing in the third quarter, revenues were down 3% driven by digital energy down 27%, on weak media demand and some project execution. As a result, our profit was down 57% to $18 million. Positive value gap was more than offset by the negative volume leverage.","Home and business solutions had a very strong quarter driven by appliances. Housing starts were up 19% with single family better by 16%, multi-family up 27%. Revenues of $2.1 billion were higher by 7% led by an 11% increase in appliances partly offset with 1% decrease in lighting. Segment profit of $77 million was up 28%. Appliances, our profit up was up 73% driven by positive value gap and productivity, partly offset by lighting. Margins improved 60 basis points in the quarter.","Next I will cover GE Capital. GE Capital revenue was $10.7 billion, down 5% driven by lower assets. Assets were down 7% or $40 billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.9 billion was up 13% from prior year, primarily driven by lower losses, better portfolio performance and higher tax benefits, which more than offset assets and gains. We ended the quarter with $385 billion of ending net investments, down $39 billion from last year and down $7 billion, sequentially.","Our net interest margin increased 22 basis points versus third quarter of '12 to 5% and was flat in the second quarter. Volume was up 6% in the quarter with new business ROI over 2%, and our Tier 1 common on a Basel 1 basis improved to 11.3% driven by reduction in assets and that's after paying $2 billion of dividends in the quarter.","On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be strong with delinquency rates stable to improving across the portfolio. In addition, non-earning assets totaled $6.4 billion, down $1.9 billion versus third quarter of 2012.","We have substantially completed all of our debt issuance for 2013 at $32 billion and we have reduced our CP balance at $33 billion, ahead of the plans bring down","CP by $35 billion by year end. Liquidity was very strong ending the quarter at $76 billion, up $7 billion from the second quarter.","Now to walk through our segment performance, CLL, the Commercial Lending and Leasing business ended the third quarter with a $170 billion of assets, down 5% from last year driven by a reduction of non-core assets of $5 billion as well as $4 billion in our core book, primarily from asset sales, including the fleet Canada, our franchise real estate transactions we spoke about.","On book core volume in Americas was up, was 2% higher in the third quarter of 2012 and new business returns remain attractive at about 2% returns on investment, despite continued excess liquidity in the market. Earnings of $479 million were down 50% driven by lower assets and impairments in our corporate aircraft portfolio in the Americas business. Asset quality was stable.","Consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, flat with last year. Net income of $889 million, was up 19%, primarily driven by lower losses as a result of not repeating the reserve modeling changes that we implemented last year in this quarter and in the first quarter of this year.","Lower losses were partially offset by no repeat of the $80 million gain on the partial sale of our interest in Thai bank in the third quarter of 2012. The U.S. Retail business earned $665 million in the third quarter, up 50% from last year, again, largely driven by not repeating the reserving change and on strong asset growth of 11% in the quarter. Our core European business earned a $111 million in the quarter.","The real estate team had another very solid quarter. Assets ended the quarter at $40 billion, down 28% to down $2 billion, sequentially. The equity book is down 27% from a year ago to $60 billion.","Net income of $464 million was up more than two times versus 2012, and that was driven by lower losses and marks as well as impairments, as well as higher tax benefits.","The business saw 77 properties with the book value of $2.1 billion for about a $100 million of gains in the quarter. That's down slightly year-over-year. The business originated $1.8 billion of debt volume in the quarter with an average ROI of 2.3% and asset quality continues to improve with 30 day delinquencies at a 141 basis points, 68 basis points lower, sequentially.","The verticals GECAS earned $173 million. That's down 31% driven by higher impairments as part of our annual impairment review. Impairments were $55 million higher in 2013 at a $190 million. The impairments were principally driven by valuations on cargo aircrafts, specifically MD-11s.","Overall, the portfolio is in great shape with only 10 MD-11 freighters remaining in our fleet, with the value of about $150 million and we ended the quarter with zero delinquency and no aircraft on the ground. EFS earnings were up 14% or $150 million driven by higher operating income.","Overall GE Capital continues to perform well. It's results were in line with our strategy. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter in terms of run rate, I expect the business to earn around 2 billion plus or [minus] the third quarter and adjusting from impairments of GECAS which not repeat and some tax benefits. We are currently working on a number of transactions in the fourth quarter, most notably the sale of our remaining interest in Bay, the Thai bank and the IPO of our Swiss consumer business.","At this point, we expect that any benefits from these transactions will largely offset with continued portfolio repositioning, but they could impact the tax rate, quarter and the year.","With that, let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Jeff, thanks. We really have no material changes in the 2013 operating objective framework. Our industrial earnings will expand by double-digits in the second half and we are on track for solid growth in the year. We have no change for expectations in GE Capital. We continue to originate business at high returns while repositioning our capital portfolio and earnings growth remain solid in GE Capital. Our corporate cost reflects our Avio adjustment, as Jeff described earlier, and we continue to see good opportunity for restructuring and our positioning offers to continue. Our cash and revenues remain on track.","We should see earnings growth accelerated in the fourth quarter with more volume and lower costs and with a large backlog in improving margins we feel good about 2014. We have several of our communications sessions with investors in the fourth quarter. In November Keith and Jeff will update our portfolio and business strategy of GE Capital and give you a sense for our long-term goals and simplification across the company. And in December, I will give you a strategic update for GE and our outlook for 2014. So we look forward to those sessions.","So in summary, we are making progress on our investor objectives for the year. Our industrial earnings grew by double digits in third quarter and we expect a stronger fourth quarter. Strength is broad based and we expect Power & Water to be a key contributor going forward in the fourth quarter and into 2014. We grew margins by 120 basis points in the quarter and we expect to hit 70 basis points for the year. In the event we have any gains on the in the fourth quarter, we expect them to be applied to restructuring.","GE Capital continues to strengthen and we are on track for up to $6.5 billion of cash to be returned to the parent. We expect organic growth of at least 5% in the fourth quarter for the industrial segments and we have solid momentum in growth markets, services and NPI and we have more favorable comparisons in Power & Water. So we are on track and we are on track to return substantial cash for investors this year. So the team executed well in the quarter and with a strong backlog and expanding margins investors should be confidence in GE's future.","So Trevor, with that, let's turn it over to you and take some questions.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great. Thanks, Jeff. I know there is other earnings call coming up. So Shaquana, let's open the phone lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of John Inch representing Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning, guys. So the fact that we did $100 million more restructuring in this quarter, do you anticipate more restructuring in the fourth quarter? I realize, Jeff you just said if there were gains you would offset that but how does that pertain to your plan and how are you thinking about the restructuring opportunity?","Jeff Immelt","May be why don't I start and Jeff, I will turn it you, but we continue to have good opportunities for restructuring throughout the company and I would expect us to do some in the fourth quarter but, again, I think if we have gains, we expect those to be offset with restructuring.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay.","Jeff Bornstein","I don't have a lot to add to that. I think that's right. I think the more we get deeper into the simplification effort, we just see increasing numbers of opportunities to take cost out of the company and make the company faster and more customer centric. So I think we will do restructuring in the fourth quarter and as Jeff said more likely than not we will reflect the gains in the we expect as well.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And Jeff, one of thing you have been at this for a little of time now. As you said, are you finding more opportunity or is it still a little early in the process before you would care to comment? If there is a -","Jeff Bornstein","I think -","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Passed out. Sorry","Jeff Bornstein","Yes. So I would say around the simplification effort, I think everyday we identify more opportunities to do what we do smarter. More shared services, a smaller manufacturing footprint, rationalizing capacity, executing our functions in a more consolidated way. So I would say, the list is growing with time and we are in the early innings of the simplification effort in this company. So I am quite emboldened with what we can accomplish over the next few years.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","And just I want to go back to the fourth quarter. You guys had great results this quarter. It still is a pretty big V, though, in terms that, and I think, the delta is really, the expectation is around power shipments. Is that really still on track or it just looks like it's a very high contributive quarter versus even historical years, although you did put up the margins this quarter? Just is there anything you can say to us about the fourth quarter? I don't know progress to date or what's you are seeing or anything like that?","Jeff Immelt","Well, I think power was obviously a big contributor in the third quarter. We are ahead a little bit on derivatives and the fourth quarter ramp for Power & Water, I think we feel very good about. When we think about units for the fourth quarter, the large units gas turbines, et cetera, most of that is in backlog, but it is 95% of it, so I think we feel very good about how we feel power is moving into the fourth quarter. We de-risk the fourth quarter little bit with the out performance here in the third quarter.","Trevor Schauenberg","John, I think you started 40 and set at that 36, so you go from 40 in March from there. We typically get a lot more revenue in Q4 than Q3. It's typical for us to get 300 basis points on margin Q4 versus Q3, and Power & Water is very backend loaded as we have always said, so you have got a bunch of stuff that really - little bit better in GE Capital, I think you have got a lot of stuff that says we are kind of ready for a very strong fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Davis representing Barclays. Please proceed.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Hi, good morning everybody. I wanted to get a sense, when I look at the results one of the thing that really stands out to me was the Power & Water orders, particularly excluding Algeria. I mean, up 37% I really wasn't aware that anybody in the world was buying a gas turbine right now or distribute power for that matter, so can you give us a little granularity, help us understand, where geographically these orders are coming from and just a little help here.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. When you look at orders in the quarter, geographically, for we will start with gas turbines. In the resource-rich regions, we were 18 units in the quarter versus 22, so down four there. Middle East, we were down 10 units from 11 to 21. A little bit better in Asia, we were flat five units versus five units year-over-year.","Most of the order strength really for our Power & Water has been around our aeroderivatives units. It has been very strong and our wind units have been incredibly strong. In the third quarter, we had 477 orders in the developed markets on wind. That's up 390 units and that explains most of the strength around wind and the balance is really Aero.","Jeff Immelt","I would say, Scott, if you look at Q4, we expect Power & Water orders to be at the high end of the range of what we talked about. So my hunch is that the orders will be clean in the 100 and a lot of that's Middle East. So we will book some of the Algerian orders in Q4. We have got some big orders in Saudi, some nice orders in Russia, couple in Africa, couple in Brazil and on the aeroderivative market, we are seeing pretty good growth in places like Canada, Middle East. So you have just got to be - the GGO and the investments we have made in emerging markets, I think has really helped us collect the orders.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, that is very helpful. And lastly guys, Jeff, the big team in the year really for your communications have done simplification, you have put a couple of sentences on that in the annual report last year and you were able to sell the other half of NBCU, which I think helps a lot, but we haven't seen a lot of other portfolio actions. I mean what's holding you back? The Wall Street Journal reported there was chatter around spinning of the credit card business, but we haven't seen any announcements there. Is this stuff all just being embedded at present and we are likely to see some announcements in the next couple of months? Or is there - maybe you can just help us understand what's -","Jeff Immelt","You know, all these things always take a little bit of time but we are still planning staged exits of the value maximizing platforms of GE Capital. We have got a big meeting set November 15, with Keith and Jeff. I think there will be more clarity at that time on the capital side. And we continue and the rest the company continue to look at ways to make the company more streamlined and more effective. So you are going to see those in good time. I think we just want to be thorough in our planning and you will get a lot more detail soon.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Okay, very helpful. Thanks guys and congrats on the margin line.","Jeff Immelt","Great, thanks. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe representing Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes, thanks, good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Yes, hi. Just going back to Power & Water, I mean that was obviously the big driver, obviously, this quarter and congratulations on margins there, but $100 million of EBIT growth year-over-year with sales down $7 million, I understand price gap was a big benefit as was simplification. But just want to confirm that with surface down 5%, that's a negative mix and big volume deleverage on gas and wind, I just want to confirm that 3Q was a good run rate for 4Q and beyond?","Jeff Immelt","Well, Nigel, what I would say, the third quarter was slightly better than even what I had thought just by little bit, but a little bit better. We had better mix. So when you have more aeroderivatives and less wind, that's a mix adder. Then we have got the simplification efforts, which Jeff said with margins or with value gap and with SG&A down 10%, that really - it's a much leaner organization. Then when you look at Q4, you are going to get kind of ball wave of more wind business, aeroderivatives is still pretty strong, heavy duty gas services are still pretty strong. I think what you are going to see in Q4, is revenue growth, our profit growth and margin growth. So what you are going to see in Q4 in Power & Water, I think it's pretty typical of what you are going to see I think going forward in the business into '14.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, understood. Obviously, you broke the parts of your energy business into two and half segments, Power & Water, energy management and oil and gas. Are we seeing the benefit of that simplification through here or is it more restructuring actions that you are taking year-to-date?","Jeff Immelt","Okay. So I would say, Nigel, as we took out the layer, we got hundreds of million of dollars of benefits as we did that. So I think that was just a starting point and then inside each business, look, we are committed to getting SG&A as a percentage of revenue down to a world-class, best-in-class level and we are on our way. We made good progress but we are not where we want to be yet. So you have some of those benefits, for sure, show up in the businesses but we have got a ways to go yet.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and just finally going back to Jeff Bornstein's comments on BAY. If that creeps into 4Q, obviously the intention is to offset that with the restructuring. That could be a pretty meaningful gain. So I am just wondering do you have a pipeline of opportunities already set to absorb that kind of gain, and maybe any color in terms of the focused areas from here for that kind of restructuring action?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. We are constantly in flight on value maximizing and the [red book] and GE Capital non-core book that we have talked about, so the gain could be sizable. We expect it will be quite profitable for us and we are working on list of items to position the portfolio for how we want to take it forward, so I think the team has got a pipeline of stuff they are working.","Jeff Bornstein","Nigel, the point I have made earlier I think on both, I mean we still have to see how the Swiss IPO goes, but we could have gains in both of those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell representing Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. Just on the margin performance, again. I mean, the overall industrial margin was up as you say 120 bps, services was up 60, so that means equipment was up 160 bps, 170 bps of flat revenues.","When you think about the mix going forward, the mix in your recurring backlog today and what that means for revenue going forward. Do you think that kind of equipment margin growth is sustainable, because obviously you have a lot of mix hit coming into that equipment margin from wind and solar in the next sort of six months?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I think, what I would say right now is that we are running ahead of the game on value gap. We are two, three quarters of the year, we are almost $700 million value gap. We expect that to continue to accelerate into the fourth quarter. On simplification and restructuring, Jeff talked about the fact that we are at the $1 billion through the third quarter. We expect that to continue and accelerate into fourth quarter.","I think on the cost side of the equation, we have got enough leverage that we are working very dramatically to deal with the fact that we are going to have more equipment shipments as we move into the fourth quarter and I think those cost opportunities are going to accelerate into 2014.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Then within oil and gas, 18% revenue growth much more subdued profit growth and obviously the margins were down. I guess, what's behind the confidence that the margins in oil and gas year-on-year will be up in Q4, because you had a pretty good margin in Q4 last year and you are coming after off the Q3 where the margin was down year-over-year?","Jeff Bornstein","Again, I would say we did have some execution issues in the third quarter, getting the backlog out, getting it out into cost structure was supposed to go out. We expect that we are going to improve on that in the fourth quarter, we got a volume lift in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, we expect to with all the cost actions and the value gap we have created in the business over the first three quarters, we expect to get some leverage on that in the fourth quarter.","I think, we feel pretty good about the fact that we will grow margins rates in the fourth quarter in oil and gas. They will not grow to the levels we thought they would for the year and that's really mostly above the M&C business. We came into the year thinking the business is going to grow something like 16% or low single-digits and that's a real missed challenge for us, but we try to get it done with better execution in the shop, the better execution on the cost structure.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thanks. Lastly, very quickly just U.S. gas turbine aftermarket business gasified power gen consumption is down 9% or 10% year-to-date. What are you thinking about your U.S. gas services business sort of looking out from here?","Jeff Immelt","The orders were pretty good. We can probably get back to you with that, but I can tell you. Do you have it, Jeff?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes. Just give me one second.","Jeff Immelt","I would tell Jeff - in that coating activity in North America is actually higher now in gas turbines than we have seen in a while, so I think we are kind of optimistic at least on the unit side for '14.","Jeff Bornstein","I think, in the U.S. we have been pretty strong. I think, we are up 8% PGS in the U.S. in the third quarter. There is still some strength in U.S. As we said, Europe was top down 18% on services related to heavy duty gas turbine, but sequentially that's a bit of an improvement from where we were in the first and second quarter.","I think really what's driving us here in the third and fourth quarter in North America, our PGS growth is our advanced - have upgrades, we did 15 in the third quarter versus four a year ago. We expect to do more than that in the fourth quarter. And that's very good business for us at very high margin. So I think we see a way forward here around services.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie representing Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Joe.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","So I just wanted to tackle this margin question little differently. As you look at the 4Q, you have got to - in order to hit your 70 basis point target margins, you have to expand by about 170 basis points and the comp is a little bit tougher. You did about 17.3% last year. So can you help me understand across each of the different industrial segments, which segments do you think are going to be above or below that 170 number and is it going to be disproportionately skewed towards Power & Water getting much better?","Jeff Bornstein","Joe, I can start and then maybe Jeff kicks in, but I think we see pretty broad based expansion in Q4. Power & Water expands but it's not the biggest driver and we have got every business up a bit and a couple, maybe three or four businesses, up 100 basis points plus. I don't know if Jeff if you want to.","Jeff Immelt","Well, let me go back to the framework we have set for people. So we described the businesses in one of three ways. We said the businesses we thought would grow margins for the year better than 70 basis points, those that would grow 0 to 70 and those that we expect to be flat. I think if we relook that framework today, we would say oil and gas is clearly going to grow margins less than 70 basis points. We thought they would do better than that. And energy management, I would say, is on a trend today to grow margins between 0 and 70 basis points, not the greater than 70 basis points we thought.","A contrast of that, I think transportation is going to be much stronger than what we originally said. We originally thought they would be flat but we think they are going to grow margins pretty substantially for the year. Then we have the a shot here, we will see how appliance strength looks in the fourth quarter but the appliance business actually may push through the 0 to 70 category or better than 70. And aviation, healthcare, as well as Power & Water are going to be right about where we said they would be. So I think those are really the changes, which is better than this 0 to 70 improvement.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay. No, that's helpful color. And I guess a follow up to that is, I know that you booked a big Algeria order and there is some short cycle.","Jeff Bornstein","Joe, we didn't book the Algeria order in the quarter.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","It's going to book. It's going to come through orders in 4Q but it's also booking ship on the aeroderivatives. I think there were 26 aeroderivatives that you are going to book and ship in 4Q. My question is based on what you either already have an backlog today or what you know is going into backlog in 4Q, how much more do you have to do to get to the margin targets that you set out?","Jeff Immelt","I think the Power & Water is almost all in backlog.","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, so what I would say is, on the unit side, gas turbines, wind turbines, more than 95% of what we will do in the fourth quarter is in backlog today. Our services business runs 50% to 60% backlog and that's kind of where we sit today. I think we have, within that we have very good line of sight to what we are going to do on AGPs in the quarter. So I think we are largely in pretty good shape. We will probably do about 70 distributor power units in the quarter and one of the reasons we will shape on those, as they tend to be a little bit shorter cycle. So I think we have pretty good visibility.","Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question come from the line of Steven Winoker representing Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Thanks.","Jeff Bornstein","Hi, wind power.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, I have been called worse.","Jeff Bornstein","Is that you, wind power?","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","That will be me, right. As I said, I have been called worse, and not only by you guys.","Jeff Bornstein","Never better than us.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","So two things I would love to dig into. The first one is just pricing versus cost value gap. What was the shipping price index? The industrial price index for shipments overall in the quarter?","Jeff Immelt","Do you have that? Yes.","Jeff Bornstein","Give me one second, Steve.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Hey, while you are doing that? My question here is, this has been such a tremendous tailwind across the businesses and as we look out and we look at the sustainability based on the order pricing over time, when I start steering into next year. Relative to commodities, just question is, I know you guys say you feel good about it, but maybe give us a little more confidence about what drives your conviction that you can continue to create a positive value gap there as we look at longer term past the fourth quarter.","Jeff Immelt","Steve, we got to do detailed business plans for 2014, but we have running positive OPI on pricing on orders. I think, we expect across most of the businesses that's going to continue and the early reads I have gotten on direct material deflation for next year and material productivity, but direct material deflation for next year is still very favorable for us. Last year, we were $350 million, something like that on a value gap. This year, we are at $660 million.","Jeff Bornstein","Just under $700 million.","Jeff Immelt","Just under $700 million, but on the way to the higher number than that, I think, Steve, we are going to be positive again next year and that will be something I will give you more flavor for in the Outlook Meeting in December.","Jeff Bornstein","Okay. The selling price quarter was 70 basis points positive.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","Okay. Great. Then another question, so when you think about Avio and some of the capital deployment and I guess the pricing the $0.02 charge that you sort of fair market value, the pricing on GAAP. I mean, did that change your view of the financial metrics for the deal originally and how do you think about that?","Maybe also broader context on oil and gas and some of those M&A that you now got a lot more track record now behind you, how are you thinking about that, Jeff, in terms of performance relative to your original expectations?","Jeff Immelt","Well let me give Jeff the Avio question now.","Jeff Bornstein","Yes. What I would say, Steven, Avio is, I think what part of those fair value adjustments tell you is the business was actually more profitable than what we thought we were buying when we finally got in there to see a lot of the detail, because of antitrust constraints, we couldn't see a lot of detail around parts of our Aviation business.","The adjustments were larger than we expected initially, but they are larger for all the right reasons, meeting the margins on the parts, particularly GE90, they have got a ton of productivity over the last number of years, simply for GE90 program, so that will work well with us or for us going forward.","Jeff Immelt","The idea was kind of unique accounting convention given their supplier relationship with us. I think that's all goodness that's going to come back to us, so this is actually I think good, helpful. On the oil and gas stuff, we like the places that we are in and the deals we have done, so but I think they are different things. Go ahead, Steve, I am sorry.","Steven Winoker - Sanford Bernstein","I just was trying to get a sense of the financial metrics also as you look back on the track record for the oil and gas deals a couple of years ago?","Jeff Immelt","Look, I think when we do reviews with our board, if you look at the deals we have done starting in 2011, 2012 and 2013, versus deal case, we are still running ahead on those.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deane Dray representing Citi Research. Please proceed.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Can we go back to get some color on the order pricing on Power & Water equipment coming in negative in the quarter and also slightly negative in oil and gas?","Just put this in context. Is there any change in the competitive environment? Is this some FX impact, because it does break a streak of some of the positive pricing that you had?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I don't know. It relates to Power & Water. I don't think there is a huge trend change here. I think, thermal pricing on units was just under 7% down I think it's an extraordinarily competitive market globally. I don't think anything has really changed there. Those dynamics haven't changed.","On wind, it really is a bifurcated world. In the U.S., we have got really good price over the first six months of the year. We feel good about where we are going with our U.S. wind. Internationally, it's more competitive around pricing and wind in the quarter on OPI was down a 130 basis points.","PGS services was better. It was up 1.4% on thermal. Then oil and gas, we got two specific dynamics going on. We had a really profitable order that we took in the third quarter of 2012 in the U.S. around an LNG facility that we didn't repeat and we had the big Russian, the Yamal order here in this quarter that was not nearly as profitable as that as well. And that really drove oil and gas OPI down in the quarter. We expect oil and gas OPI in the fourth quarter to get back to a positive and we expect it to be positive for the year on a year-to-date basis.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great, I liked that last point you made. And then, just thinking about the fourth quarter, Jeff, you said that you are tracking well for solid organic revenue growth. The slides, as you are biased towards the low end of the range, but clearly you have got momentum here and I would liked your comment that you have got a slight hedge in the plans for more contingency. How does that contingency change, let's say, versus the first quarter? Because you certainly look like you have got a lot more buffer in hitting these margin targets today versus where we were in the first quarter.","Jeff Immelt","I think, Deane, it's about the same hedge we had at the end of the second quarter and then, for us on the revenue side, basically you have got the whole company, ex-Power & Water, which has operated pretty well all year and what you are going to see in fourth quarter is just a more normal run rate for Power & Water. So that's really, if you think about the range we had on the page and how I talk about the business going forward, really the only difference is Power & Water. And so you are going to see a more normal quarter for Power & Water from a revenue standpoint and that should carry forward into next year.","Deane Dray - Citi Research","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Immelt","Great.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Hi, good morning.","Jeff Immelt","Hey, Steve. How are you doing?","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Not too bad. So I think you said 5% industrial revenue growth, as you were exiting the slide deck before Q&A through fourth quarter?","Jeff Immelt","Yes.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","That's organic?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. That's the expectation around 5% for Q4.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay. So for the year, you guys are going to end up around flat for the year to up 1%, 0% to 1% type of thing?","Jeff Immelt","Well, we think we will be at the lower end of the range in there, Steve.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Okay, and then I am just curious as to, ultimately there were some moving parts here with the slide you gave in the first quarter on Power & Water, I think it was slide five where you guys laid out the first and the second half and you kind of underperformed a bit in the second quarter on pure profit $1.1 billion versus $1.3 billion. You had $2.9 billion for the second half. Maybe could you just tell us where you are going to be relatively to that $2.9 billion for profit for Power & Water ?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. Steve, I don't know. I don't think we are going to guide on that.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","I mean you are obviously going to be above it though, right, I would assume?","Jeff Immelt","Yes. I don't think I can give you any answer on that. I don't think - we don't provide guidance. I don't think I can give you that number. Here's what I would said about third quarter to fourth quarter is the way I would think about it, and power is a piece of this construct, is we will end the third quarter here on an adjusted basis at $0.40 a share. We typically get a big volume ramp from third quarter to fourth quarter. Last year that was $0.08. This year we have got a bigger ramp volume wise going from third quarter to fourth quarter.","We are going to do that with a much better cost structure than what we did last year third quarter to fourth quarter. More value gap. We are ahead of the curve on SG&A and cost savings. That's going to give us additional incrementals, additional volume leverage as we move from third to fourth quarter.","So Power & Water is a piece of that framework. They are a big piece of it because they have a very large volume ramp from third to fourth quarter and I think we feel very good about the construct that we have around that and all of that should help us achieve the 70 basis points for the year.","Jeff Bornstein","Steve, Power & Water is going to have positive revenue, positive gross profit and positive margins in Q4.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes, right. Thanks","Jeff Immelt","It is going to perform well.","Jeff Bornstein","Steve, the last thing I would add is, if you go back to last seven years, five in the last seven years we have grown margins from third to fourth quarter better than 250 basis points. In four of the last seven years we have grown to more than 310 basis points from third quarter to fourth quarter, so.","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","Yes, clearly. And then just on the distributed power stuff. I didn't quite, again going back to that slide where you had aero of 100 units. It sounds like you are dramatically kind of outperforming. Could you just maybe talk about where the distributed power stuff came from this quarter and is this a timing issue for this year, or is that pure upside this year relative to what you expected in the fourth quarter, because I know there was a big group of distributed power stuff coming in the fourth quarter seem to come a bit early?","Jeff Immelt","It's pretty global business. I would say there is more opportunities in the Middle East, and Asia and places like that. I would say there was some more in the third quarter than what we expected, but I still expect them to have a good solid growth in Q4 as well, but I would say, we probably at the end of the day, had a few more aeroderivatives in Q3 than we originally expected.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan, representing Nomura. Please proceed.","Shannon O'Callaghan Nomura","Good morning, guys. Just in terms of the restructuring and gains in the fourth quarter, it sounds like you might go ahead and do some restructuring. If you do, you will have some gains in industrial, but as it plays into the 70 basis points, right? The restructuring is incorporated, the gains are in segments. Is that all gravy on top of that? There is none of that sort of baked into getting to the 70?","Jeff Immelt","Shannon, the way that I talked about it today and the way we are planning is the 70 is without gains, so basically the intent is to use the gains we had to do additional restructuring.","Shannon O'Callaghan Nomura","Okay, but like I said restructuring (Inaudible) I know weren't any in the quarter, but it is not in the quarter.","Jeff Immelt","If we have, right?","Shannon O'Callaghan Nomura","Yes. Okay. Then just on the framework, the high single-digit to low double-digit operating earnings, back at EPG, you also used to show that that translated to double-digit EPS growth and now no one sort of there in terms of consensus. I mean, is this double-digit part of the equation sort of not on the table anymore?","I mean, I know it's still high single digits to double-digit operating earnings, which doesn't seem like we are getting there on, on the EPS basis. Is that kind off the table at this point?","Jeff Bornstein","Look, we don't give guidance any more. Okay? So, let's start with that. Again, I think you have got some stuff in Avio and stuff in corporate, but when you look at Industrial and Capital, I actually view those exactly the same way we have looked at them when I was at EPG.","Jeff Immelt","Shaquana, we are running up against another earnings call, so why don't we take one more question here?","Operator","Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn, representing Oppenheimer. Please proceed.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Last year late in the year, things got a little variable up there in the economy, customers taking delivery. If we look at your backlog, I was wondering what the key variables are in terms of how backlog execution could play out? Just for example I think, from healthcare orders it would seem would be seem positive growth there by now.","Jeff Immelt","Yes. Chris, I will give you a view. I actually think the backlog is pretty firm. I don't think there is commercial issues really, I think what Jeff talked about like in oil and gas is stuff that we could have executed better on, so we are not seeing really any kind of variability in the marketplace in terms of customers pushing back on deliveries.","Jeff Immelt","Great. Why don't we wrap up today. Thank you everyone for attending. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We will be distributing our quarterly supplementals data for GE Capital later this morning.","I have some announcement regarding the upcoming investor events.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. My name is Ellen, and I will be your conference coordinator today. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Good morning and thanks for joining our first quarter 2016 webcast. I'm here with our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our CFO, Jeff Bornstein; and our Vice President, Gas Power Systems, Joe Mestrangelo.","Earlier today, we posted a press release, presentation and supplemental on our Investor website at www.ge.com\/investor. As a reminder, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. As described in our SEC filings and on our website, those elements can change as the world changes.","Now with that, I'd like to turn it over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment. EPS of $0.21 was up 5%. This includes $0.02 of headwind due through foreign exchange.","Let me summarize some of the key achievements in the quarter. Industrial organic revenue was down slightly; and operating profit was about flat, despite a very challenging environment in Oil & Gas and tough comparisons in gas turbine shipments. This is in line with our expectations.","Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points, up 110 basis points ex FX. And CFOA was $7.9 billion, a good start in the year. We're on track to close Appliances in the second quarter, and this will facilitate incremental restructuring and capital allocation optionality.","We continue to execute our GE Capital strategy. We have $166 billion of capital deals signed. GE Capital sent a $7.5 billion dividend to the parent in the quarter. And GE Capital filed for SIFI de-designation in March. Alstom integration is on track for our $0.05 goal of 2016. We're more comfortable with the business and our ability to create value. We returned $8.3 billion to investors in dividend and buyback; and our capital allocation framework remains on track.","Importantly, we are reaffirming our 2016 framework goal of $1.45 to $1.55 EPS; 2% to 4% organic growth; CFOA of $29 billion to $32 billion; and $26 billion of cash to investors. Our performance in the quarter again validates the strength of the GE operating model.","Diversity is a key strength during this period of volatility. We're in the midst of a challenging Oil & Gas market. However, we are things sustained strength in Aviation and Power markets. Healthcare is rebounding. I was in China last week and saw improvements in our business. Most of the portfolios are strong and we're delivering. There's plenty of business out there to achieve our goals.","Orders were up slightly in the quarter, down organically; and pricing was flat. We ended the quarter with $316 billion of backlog, up 18% year-over-year. Our investments in technology are paying off. Power orders grew by 25%. Our backlog of HA turbines is now totaled 35. Renewable organic orders grew by 88%, behind the launch of new 2 megawatt and 3 megawatt turbines. Healthcare equipment orders grew by 6%, with double-digit orders in the U.S.","We continue to win in the Aviation market as the LEAP remains the engine of choice and on track for a successful launch. Globally, orders were up 9% in developed markets with broad-based growth; and down 9% in emerging markets, in line with the volatility we see in resource-rich countries.","Service continues to be quite robust. Power Services grew by 17%, ex-Alstom; and Aviation grew by 13%. Digital orders grew by 29%. We launched Predix and attracted 7,500 developers in just 30 days. Meanwhile, we continue to attract new customers to our digital offerings. Oil & Gas markets remain tough. Activity slowed again in the quarter and was reflected on our orders rate decline.","However, we continue to make progress with our customers, signing the industry's first performance-based contract with Diamond Offshore. We're confident that GE will outperform in this cycle. Overall, our backlog and momentum support our 2% to 4% organic growth target for the year.","Revenue was up 6% in the first quarter, down 1% organically; in line with our plan. The main driver of the revenue profile in the first quarter is Power. In the first quarter 2015, Power organic revenue grew by 21%, as we delivered several large orders. Without this impact, organic revenue would have grown by 3% in the first quarter.","Some highlights in the quarter include: Services up 13%; Aviation up 10%; and China grew by 10% with 15% growth in Healthcare. Healthcare had the best organic growth in 20 quarters; and Renewables grew by 34%.","We still believe that organic growth will be up 2% to 4% for the year. Healthcare, Power, Aviation, and Renewables are expected to have strong growth, substantially better than 2015; and this will more than offset headwinds in Oil & Gas and Transportation. Our second half of 2016 is lining up to be about 5% organic growth, based on equipment backlog profiles.","Core Industrial margins grew by 30 basis points. Margins would have grown 110 basis points without FX headwind. We continue to make solid progress in sourcing and simplification. Service margins expanded by 190 basis points, as we continue to see benefits from our efforts in analytics. Our integration efforts with Alstom are just beginning, but we see great potential.","GE is executing well in a challenging environment. Cash was in line with expectations. As I said earlier, we received a $7.5 billion dividend from Capital. Industrial was impacted by Alstom with a typical first quarter profile. We expect to hit $29 billion to $32 billion of CFOA in 2016. Our balance sheet remains very strong, and we ended the quarter with $106 billion of liquidity at GE Capital and $9 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","Meanwhile, we returned $8.3 billion of cash to investors in buyback and dividend. We expect to receive $18 billion from GE Capital for the year, and Appliances is expected to close in the second quarter.","As I said earlier, we applied for SIFI de-designation in March. Our application is quite strong. We've addressed all of the FSOC concerns which led to the original systemic designation, and we'll give you more updates as we learn more.","Now I'd like to give a sense for our dynamics in 2016. Most of the company is quite strong. Specifically, we feel great about what we're seeing in Aviation, Healthcare, Power and Renewables. Their results should be better than what we showed in December. In addition, we're investing in the gains from the Appliances business sale into incremental restructuring to achieve lower cost.","At the same time, we see pressure in the Oil & Gas business. The team had a decent first quarter, particularly when you take into account foreign exchange. However, we want to take a more conservative position on the year, posting revenue down 15% to 20% and operating profit down 30%. We will continue to outperform our competitors and capitalize on volatility. We've always said the value of GE is the strength of our portfolio, and we are reaffirming our $1.45 to $1.55 EPS framework for 2016.","I also wanted to spike out our performance at Alstom, where we're expecting $0.05 EPS in 2016. We had solid performance in the first quarter, $3 billion of orders with renewed momentum. And I really like our opportunities for gas turbine balance of plan, HVDC, and steam turbines. In addition, taking a dedicated look at Renewables is making us smarter and faster.","We have massive potential to utilize the combined supply chain. Synergies were $100 million in the first quarter, on the path to $1.1 billion in the year. Segment operating profit is ahead of plan. Jeff will go through the segments, but big picture this is working.","Now I would like to introduce Joe Mastrangelo. Joe leads our Gas Power Systems business. He can bring the Alstom benefits to life and tell you how we're winning in the marketplace.","Joseph R. Mastrangelo - President & CEO, Gas Power Systems, GE Power, General Electric Co.","Thanks, Jeff. I'll start with a quick market overview.","Overall demand for Gas Power Systems is steady, and we forecast the market to be between 55 to 60 gigawatts for both heavy duty and aero gas turbines. Globally, we continue to see strong demand in North America and Asia, with good growth in China. There are also pockets of country-specific growth in the Middle East and Africa, both for utility-scale and fast power applications. In addition, commercial activity is increasing in both Argentina and Mexico, driven by recent government reforms.","2016 is the production launch for the HA turbine platform, and our team is ready to meet the challenge of shipping about 24 HA gas turbines this year. The industry continues to shift to the H, or high-efficiency technology. Last year this accounted for 40% of the total industry orders, and we expect that to rise to more than half of all gigawatts sold by 2020.","Fast power demand can be lumpy from quarter to quarter, and customers want megawatts online in months. Using aeroderivative gas turbines combined with Alstom expanded scope capability plus local execution and financing from the GE Store, we have the ability to quickly go from customer need to power on the grid anywhere in the world.","Moving to Alstom, this is a great marriage of two technology portfolios, high-performing gas turbines from GE and the highest efficiency steam-tail technology from Alstom. We have industry-leading, fully integrated power island solution capability. Around 10% of our orders came from Alstom technology in the first quarter, and we are now quoting Alstom steam tails on every combined cycle opportunity, a big shift from pre-Alstom where we sold steam tails less than 30% of the time. This is our single biggest growth opportunity in the near term, and we expect strong 2016 orders that will convert into 2017 revenue.","In the first quarter, we shipped 13 heavy-duty gas turbines, and our forecast is to ship 40 in the first half and 75 in the second half, for 115 total year shipments. Right now, 101 of those turbines are in backlog, and we see opportunities to potentially be better than our current forecast.","The next page covers the HA platform launch. We are very pleased with progress on this program, both commercially, where we continue to win in the marketplace, and also on equipment performance, which is exceeding expectations.","The H backlog continues to grow, and we will deliver about $2 billion of revenue this year with positive total year margin. Our integrated approach to the market translates into more equipment being sold per megawatt shipped. Alstom improves our steam turbines, generators, and heat recovery steam generator [HRSG] performance, and it shows in our orders. In the first 200 days since the acquisition, we have already closed more than double the HRSG orders then Alstom did in the last three years combined.","Our launch plant for EDF in France has set a world record output for both simple cycle and combined cycle configurations. We're also on track to set another world record for combined cycle efficiency when this plant goes online in the middle of June. We continue to develop and introduce new models at record speed. And during the first quarter we did a flawless validation of the 7HA.02 gas turbine. This turbine performed better than our initial engineering models, and our first units were shipped during the first quarter.","Exelon is another powerful example of the Alstom and GE combination. These two projects in Texas have 100% GE Power Island technology. It wasn't sold that way because Alstom wasn't yet part of GE at the time. But bringing these teams together gives us the ability to derisk project execution and deliver stronger operating performance. The HA platform is one of the biggest product line launches in GE's history. The team is performing well, and this technology is a key driver to both growth and profitability.","Here are three great examples of projects that are improving both business profitability and delivering the lowest cost of electricity for our customers. The first example combines new technology with a vertical integration on three-dimensional compressor airfoils that improve the output and efficiency for the HA turbine. We deliver $12 million annual cost savings, raise our supply chain capability, and reduce production cycle time.","The middle of the page highlights the power of the GE Store. We brought together engineers from GE Power, Alstom, and the GRC, who developed new high temperature material for our F-Class fleet. It's less expensive and also improves gas turbine performance, where higher temperatures equal better efficiency. Once again, new equipment cost of electricity goes down while creating a new service upgrade opportunity.","Generators are an example of taking existing Alstom technology and putting it into our product catalog instead of buying it from a third party. We not only lowered our cost position, but also improved performance and reliability.","The next page looks at our 2016 op margin profile. The HA will become profitable in 2Q at about the time we ship our 12th unit. We've taken over 30% of cost out of the turbine in our first year of production.","Now let's put that into historical perspective. The 10th HA turbine shipment is equal to the 1,000th F-Class turbine shipped on a dollar per kilowatt basis. We are delivering higher performance for value with the combination of improved gas turbine output and Alstom steam technology.","Here are two projects in the U.S. The first one is TVA, which we closed in 2014; and our scope was just the gas turbine and the generator, which translated into a value of $178 per kilowatt for GE. Now fast-forward to the first quarter of this year, where we closed an HA deal with PSEG. We sold the gas turbine and the generator and added in the Alstom steam tail, highlighted in light blue.","We more than double our dollars sold for the same amount of kilowatts delivered. Our customers get better value; in this case, an incremental $5 million because the Power Island operates at improved efficiency.","This is very exciting, and now let me share with you one more thing; how our digital capability is improving our Industrial performance. Take the two first circles, we are opening new design spaces and allowing our factory to produce smaller features and tighter tolerances, with world-class quality.","We build the digital twin when we design the machine and direct link that model to advanced manufacturing technologies like 3D printing and additive manufacturing. This allows rapid prototyping and the ability to ramp up production faster.","Then, we test our equipment harder than it will ever operate in the field at our state-of-the-art full load test facility. This is one-of-a-kind capability in our industry. During testing, we have more than 7,000 data streams that capture more than 500 terabytes of data. That data goes back to our technology team to both validate designs and improve performance.","The blue circle is an example of this. It shows the first two stages of turbine blading that have thousands of small holes to allow the metal to safely operate above its melting point. We color the blades with thermal paint to validate the design performance on the test end. And now with our new Metem acquisition, we can rapidly prototype and bring into production new cooling hole configuration that optimize performance and efficiency. What once took years could now be accomplished in a matter of weeks.","The far right circle shows how combining digital and Industrial expertise delivers value. The blue represents a compressor test and campaign compared to the orange, which is one year of operating performance for a 537 7F gas turbine fleet. These results create an expanded operating space for our customers, where moving up and to the right can deliver up to $10 million in incremental value.","The data then becomes the basis for a Predix enabled application that allows our customers to maximize performance while operating the equipment safely. This page shows why the HA program launch is proceeding so smoothly; faster than we've ever done before, while continuously innovating our technology platform.","Thanks for listening, and now I'll turn it over to Jeff Bornstein.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Joe. I will start with the first quarter summary.","Revenues were $27.8 billion, up 6% in the quarter. Industrial revenues were up 7% to $25 billion. You can see on the right side that Industrial segments were up 6% reported and down 1% organic. Alstom revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion. Industrial operating plus verticals EPS was $0.21, up 5%. That includes $0.05 of net restructuring this year versus $0.03 a year ago.","If you look at the box at the bottom of the page, we provided the V% and adjusted for Industrial gains in restructuring. Excluding those impacts in both years, Industrial EPS was up 5% and Industrial plus vertical EPS was up 14%.","The operating EPS number of $0.06 includes other continuing GE Capital activity, including headquarter runoff and other exit-related items that I will cover on the GE Capital page. Continuing EPS of $0.02 includes the impact of non-operating pension; and net EPS of $0.01 loss includes discontinued operations. The total disc-ops impact was a charge of $300 million in the quarter, driven by GE Capital exit costs.","As Jeff said, we generated $7.9 billion of CFOA in the quarter, up from $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2015, driven by increased dividend from GE Capital. Industrial CFOA was $400 million, down 60%. There were two big drivers of the year-over-year decline. First, Alstom used about $400 million of cash in the quarter, and this is primarily timing. Consistent with what we've said previously, we expect Alstom to be breakeven to slightly positive on CFOA for the year.","Second, as you're aware, we have a very second-half loaded volume profile, driven by Power. And as a result, we began level-loading the factories, which has resulted in higher inventory in the quarter.","The GE tax rate was 17% and the GE Capital tax rate was 36%, which for GE Capital reflects a tax benefit on a pre-tax continuing loss.","On the right side are the segment results. As I mentioned, Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and down 1% organically. Foreign exchange translation of $544 million was a two-point headwind, as was lost revenue from dispositions of $542 million. Those impacts were more than offset by $2.8 billion of revenue from Alstom.","As Jeff mentioned, foreign exchange had a significant impact on segment op profit this quarter. In total, we had $255 million headwind driven by $33 million of FX translation and $223 million of foreign exchange transactional impacts from remeasurement and mark-to-market on open hedges.","Traditionally, remeasurement of mark-to-market have been de minimis. For example, in all of 2015 it was about $30 million; and for 2014 it was less than $5 million for the year. It's unusual for us to have this big of an impact, which is why we're calling it out here this quarter.","This outsized impact in the quarter was driven by significant movements in certain currencies versus prior quarter. For example, the weakening of the pound sterling, the strengthening of the Japanese yen, and the strengthening of the Brazilian reis. These impacts were principally felt in Power and Oil & Gas, given the global nature of those businesses; and Alstom was a driver as well, given their broad global footprint.","It's important to note that we are economically hedged and that the remeasurement and mark-to-market impacts are just timing. The underlying transactions for which these hedges were put in place will occur in sales and costs over the coming quarters. And the net impact of the hedge and the underlying transaction will be roughly zero over the life of the contract. So again, the $223 million of FX movement will flow back to earnings over time.","On the right side of the page, you'll see the Industrial segment op profit was down 7% reported and down 4% organically. The organic number of 4% excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions and FX translation only. Excluding the impacts of transactional FX, as I just discussed, organic segment profit was up 2% in the quarter.","Next on Industrial other items for the quarter, we had $0.05 of charges related to Industrial restructuring and other items that were taken at corporate. Charges were $686 million on a pre-tax basis, with $164 million of those charges related to Alstom synergy investments, deal costs and accounting items. We also had a gain of $59 million pre-tax related to the sale of our space at 30 Rock, which netted to less than $0.01 impact.","At the bottom of the page, you can see the profile for the year. We expect gains in restructuring to largely offset, but with quarterly variability and timing. As you know, we signed the Appliances transaction, which we expect to contribute about $0.20 of gain in the second quarter. In the second half, we have asset management disposition and some smaller transactions that will contribute an additional $0.05, bringing total year gains to approximately $0.25. This allows us to significantly restructure our cost bases and will make us more competitive in 2017 and beyond.","Next, I will go through the segments, starting with power. The Power business had a very strong orders quarter. Total orders of $5.6 billion were up 66%, including $1.5 billion of Alstom orders. Excluding Alstom, orders were up 23% to $4.2 billion, with equipment orders higher by 57% and services higher by 11%.","Equipment orders strength was driven by Gas Power Systems where we took orders for 25 gas turbines, versus 21 a year ago, including an additional six H turbines. We also had orders for seven steam turbines for combined cycle versus zero a year ago.","The U.S. was strong accounting for 73% of orders value; and international was also strong, up 21%. Our H unit backlog stands at 35 after receiving orders for six new units and shipping our first four units. Alstom steam orders totaled $300 million in the quarter. We took an order for one steam turbine and a turbo generator for coal applications. In conjunction with GE gas turbine, Alstom also took orders for five additional HRSGs.","Core GE services grew orders 11% on strength in Power Services up 17%. Total upgrades were 52 versus 49 last year, including orders for 25 AGPs higher by nine from last year. In addition to AGPs, we're seeing higher demand for other upgrades like Dry Low NOx and flange-to-flange upgrades. Alstom services booked 1 billion of orders, including 22 steam turbine retrofits.","In total, backlog ended at $78 billion. Excluding Alstom, backlog ended at $63 billion, with $9 billion of equipment up 51% and services of $54 billion up 7%.","Revenue of $5.2 billion was up 13%, with equipment down 24% and services up 40%. Excluding Alstom, revenues were down 18% driven by equipment revenue down 48% on 26 fewer gas turbine shipments and 35 fewer generators, as we expected. Services, excluding Alstom, grew revenues 5% driven by Power Services up 7%. Upgrades were 54 this year versus 55 a year ago, including 27 AGPs which was six higher.","Op profit, excluding Alstom, was $547 million in the quarter, down 28% on the lower gas turbine volume, negative cost leverage and negative currency. This was partly offset by services growth. In the quarter, we had $48 million of currency drag, mostly from transactional foreign exchange, principally on the euro and the yen. We expect these transnational hedges to reverse over time.","Alstom contributed op profit of $26 million in the quarter, including the effects of purchase accounting and currency. Transactional FX for Alstom was a $33 million headwind.","First quarter results were as expected and, as Joe mentioned, reflect the timing of our gas turbine volume for 2016, which is heavily second half loaded. We continue to win with the H turbine, including pulling through Alstom steam generators and HRSGs. We expect to deliver 115-plus gas turbines this year, with 101 in backlog, and we will continue to drive H margins throughout the year. We're on plan for Alstom synergies for the year of about $800 million.","Next is Renewables. Orders in the quarter were $2 billion, up 110% in the quarter. Orders were higher by 86%, excluding Alstom. Our core wind business took orders for 711 wind turbines versus 376 a year ago. U.S. orders were very strong, up 144%, including an order for 96 units that slipped from the fourth quarter. Orders for the new 2.X and 3.X products accounted for almost 70% of our unit orders.","Alstom renewable orders were $225 million driven by Hydro with orders in China, Laos and the U.S. Total backlog at $12.4 billion, includes $5 billion contributed by Alstom. Core backlog of $7.4 billion grew 43%.","Revenue in the quarter of $1.7 billion was higher by 62%, with the core business up 34%. The core business shipped 616 turbines versus 472 last year. About half of the shipped units were the new 2.X product. Alstom revenues of $295 million were principally attributable to Hydro.","Operating profit in the quarter totaled $83 million, inclusive of $91 million from the core business and an $8 million loss from Alstom. Core profitability was driven by higher volume and a termination payment that was more than offset by 2.X launch costs and negative foreign exchange.","The quarter was a good start for the year, with strong order growth and execution in both the Legacy and Alstom segments. We continue to expect the business to ship about 3,050 wind turbines in 2016, with about 100 coming from Alstom versus the 250 we originally guided and 150 more from GE. The business is on track to deliver over $100 million of Alstom synergies for the year.","Next is Aviation. Aviation continues to perform well, as does the market. Global passenger air travel for February year to date grew 8%, its strongest performance since 2008. Both domestic and international routes saw robust growth. Airfreight volumes contracted about 1.6% through February.","Aviation orders in the quarter were $6.6 billion, down 12%. Equipment orders were down 35% to $2.6 billion, as we expected. We booked $1.7 billion of commercial equipment orders, including $800 million of LEAP CFM, $400 million of GE90, and about $100 million of GEnx orders. Military equipment was higher by 91% on large naval orders.","Service orders grew 13% to $4 billion, on spares up 2%, repairs up 10%, and CFAs up 34%. Services backlog grew 11% versus the first quarter of last year.","Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 10%, with equipment higher by 2%. The business shipped 53 GEnx units versus 51 last year. Service revenue grew 17%, with spares up 6% and strength in commercial services and military. Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 16% on services volume and cost productivity, and operating profit margins expanded 110 basis points.","Aviation had another solid quarter. The LEAP launch remains on track, and we expect to ship 15 to 20 units in the second quarter and about 110 engines for the year. We've now accumulated more than 19,000 cycles on the LEAP engine, and all the engines were performing well and all were meeting their fuel specifications.","Next is Oil & Gas. We're operating in an incredibly difficult environment. In the first quarter, U.S. onshore rig counts were down another 27% from year end and down 72% from the 2014 peak. U.S. well counts are down 64% versus the first quarter 2015, and CapEx and investment decisions continue to be pushed out in virtually every segment.","We continue to be focused on the things we can control, principally on cost and competitiveness. Orders in the quarter were down 44%, with equipment orders down 70%. Every segment saw significantly lower equipment orders. Subsea was down 83%. TMS was down 92%. Surface was down 43%, and downstream was down 14%.","Service orders were down 19% in total, with all segments also declining. TMS was down 4%, Surface 28%, Subsea 57%, downstream 23%, and digital solutions were down 5%. Not included in orders but included in backlog, we signed a CSA contract with Diamond Offshore. The deal covers four BOP sets and was done in conjunction with our energy financing business.","Backlog ended the quarter at $22.6 billion, down 1% from the fourth quarter. Equipment backlog totaled $8.8 billion, down 7% from last year; and Service backlog totaled $13.8 billion, up 3% from last year.","Revenue in the quarter was down 18%, down 14% organically. Equipment revenues were down 23%, 18% organically, driven by Surface down 45%, TMS down 23%, Subsea down 26%, and downstream grew revenue 14%. Service revenues were down 13%, down 9% organic, with all segments lower with the exception of TMS, which grew revenue 6% organically in the quarter.","Operating profit of $308 million was down 37% and down 31% organically. The business delivered approximately $140 million of cost actions, which was more than offset by lower volume, price, and foreign exchange. Foreign exchange in the quarter was a $95 million headwind, driven by FX associated translation of $25 million and transactional FX of $70 million.","In an extremely tough market, the team will continue to drive cost and market share. We are on track to deliver against the $800 million cost target. Our restructuring investment will likely increase from $350 million to about $500 million to achieve the benefits, as lower volume will offset some of the realization. The increased restructuring is within the restructuring framework we've been sharing with you.","As Jeff mentioned, given the difficult market and how orders have started the year, we are now planning Oil & Gas operating profit down approximately 30% in 2016. We expect strength elsewhere in the portfolio and aggressive corporate cost management to maintain our plan. No change in guidance of the $1.45 to $1.55.","Next up is Healthcare, which had a very strong quarter. Orders in the quarter of $4.2 billion were up 5% organic and 1% reported. Geographically, orders grew 3% in the United States, 14% in China, 4% in Europe, and 2% in Asia-Pacific, partially offset by weakness in Latin America, which was down 12%, principally driven by Brazil.","In terms of business lines, Healthcare systems grew orders 5% organically and 2% reported, with strength in the U.S. driven by strong CT growth of 26% on increased traction on the new Evolution CT launch and 16% growth in the ultrasound business. Organically, China was up 12% and Europe grew 6%, with broad growth across the region. Our life science business was up 7% organically with strength in both bioprocess, up 7%, and core imaging higher by 10%.","Healthcare revenues of $4.2 billion were up 3% reported and up 6% organically. Healthcare systems grew revenue 4% organic and 1% reported, and life sciences grew 13% organically and 6% reported.","Operating profit was up 7% reported, up 10% organically. Strong productivity and volume growth offset price and NPI digital spending, and margins improved in the quarter 70 basis points. The business is beginning to deliver on the growth from NPI investments we've made and it's restructuring to deliver lower products and service costs. The business is on track to meet or exceed the framework we shared with you and investors in March.","Next, Transportation continues to face a very tough domestic market. Commodity carloads in the first quarter were down 12%, driven by coal down 31% and petroleum products were down 17%. Intermodal grew modestly, up 1%.","Orders for the quarter of $653 million were down 56%, as we expected. Equipment orders were weak, down 89%. Service orders were down 3% organically and down 18% reported, principally driven by lower local parts.","Backlog ended at $21 billion. That's down 2% from the end of the year. Revenues in the quarter were down 25%, driven by lower equipment revenues. The business shipped 156 locos in the first quarter versus 215 last year. Service revenues were flat, excluding the sale of Signaling.","Operating profit of $164 million was down 27%, down 22% organically, driven by lower volume and variable cost productivity, partially offset by strong deflation and structural cost take out. Base costs were lower by 13%. Op profit margins contracted 50 basis points in the quarter.","The team continues to aggressively drive product and service costs, as well as structural cost out, given the volume challenges they faced this year. We still expect to ship approximately 800 locos in 2016; and our outlook for the year remains unchanged.","Energy connection to orders totaled $2.7 billion in the quarter, up 27%. Organically orders were down 13%, driven by Power Conversion down 20% on weakness in Oil & Gas, partially offset by strength in Renewables.","Industrial Solutions was down 7% organically on weakness in the North American market. Grid orders were $1.25 billion in the quarter. And backlog finished the quarter at $11.9 billion, of which Grid Solutions contributed $8.4 million.","Revenues in the quarter of $2.3 billion were up 34% reported. Organic revenues were down 6%. Grid Solutions revenues totaled $1.1 billion.","Operating profit was a loss of $85 million. The core business of Industrial Solutions and Power Conversion recorded a loss of $47 million, driven by lower Oil & Gas volume, higher digital investment and lost earnings from the sale of our Embedded business in 2015. SG&A was down 8% in the quarter.","Grid Solutions recorded a loss of $38 million, driven by $20 million of operational earnings, offset by $40 million of purchase accounting charges and $23 million of transactional foreign exchange.","Alstom synergies in the quarter were ahead of plan, and their business is on track for the year to deliver over $200 million of synergies. We feel good about the progress we're making in integrating Digital Energy and Alstom Grid.","Overall, Energy Connections had a challenging quarter, but we expect their results to improve over the year beginning in the second quarter. We're investing to make this segment more competitive and to improve profitability. We like these businesses for the long-term.","Next, Appliances and Lighting. We remain on track for a 2Q closing for our sale of Appliances to Haier. Haier shareholders approved the transaction on March 31. In the quarter, segment revenue grew 3%, with Appliances revenue growth of 8% on strong industry volume, which is up 7%, including strength in both retail up 6% and contract up 9%.","Lighting revenue was lower by 6% organically, driven by continued strength in LED, offset by a contraction in the legacy Lighting business.","Segment profit of $115 million was higher by 13%, driven by the strength in Appliances on strong productivity and commodity deflation.","The last segment I'll cover is GE Capital. Our Verticals businesses are in $496 million this quarter. That's up 43% from prior year, driven by higher gains, better operations, partially offset by lower tax benefits and impairment. Portfolio quality continues to remain stable.","Other continuing operations generated a $1.4 billion loss in the quarter, principally driven by excess interest expense, the expense associated with the first quarter of 2016 $4 billion hybrid tender, headquarter operating costs restructuring and other charges related to GE Capital transformation, including the costs associated with preferred equity exchange, which we also executed earlier in the quarter.","To date, we've incurred $22.6 billion of costs related to the GE Capital exit plan, and we remain on track versus our $23 billion estimate. Discontinued operations incurred a loss of $300 million in the quarter, largely driven by marks on held-for-sale assets. Overall, GE Capital reported a $1.2 billion loss in the quarter.","We ended the quarter with $127 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity, with Verticals at $78 billion of ENI. Liquidity at the end of the first quarter was $106 billion.","Our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 14.5%, which is flat from year-end after paying dividends of $7.5 billion during the quarter. The timing of dividends for the rest of the year is dependent on the timing a deal closures, but we expect to pay roughly half of the $18 billion we've targeted in the first half of the year and the remainder in the second half.","Asset sales remain ahead of plan; and during the quarter, we closed $42 billion of transactions, including $28 billion related to Wells Fargo sale, bringing the total closed transactions through the end of the quarter to $146 billion to-date. In addition, we signed agreements for an additional $9 billion in the first quarter, bringing total signings to $166 billion to-date.","Our price to tangible book on deals signed to-date is 1.3 times tangible book and we're on track for the 1.1 times price to tangible book that we estimated a year ago. What is left to sign is primarily outside the U.S. with our country platforms in France and Italy and the execution of our IPO of the Czech bank. We expect to have a small balance of assets left through year-end.","Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team have executed ahead of schedule and on all aspects of plan we shared with you one year ago. We expect to be largely completed with the asset sales by 2016.","On March 31, we filed the request to the FSOC for the rescission of GE Capital's de-designation as a SIFI. The filing demonstrates that GE Capital substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to the financial system and therefore does not pose any threat to the U.S. financial system. We hope to complete the de-designation process as soon as possible.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff. Our operating framework remains on track. We expect the operating EPS to be $1.45 to $1.55. We're remixing the Industrial content; and all other dynamics remain on track.","Cash performance has improved slightly based on the Appliances' disposition that we expect to complete in the second quarter. Overall, free cash flow and dispositions will equal $29 billion to $32 billion; and we expect to return $26 billion to investors in buyback and dividends. The GE model is producing for investors in this volatile economy. The strength of our portfolio will deliver strong EPS and cash growth. We're executing well with Alstom.","Before we end, I wanted to give you a sense for how we've aligned the team's compensation with investors. For 2016, our AEIP goals, in essence our internal plan, is above this framework. And for 2016 to 2018, our LTIP ties to the three-year EPS and capital allocation walk we showed you at the outlook meeting. I feel great about our strategy, execution and the strength of our business model.","Matt, now over to you for questions.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Thanks, Jeff. And I'll ask the operator to open the lines up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I know this might be tough to answer, and this if for Jeff Bornstein, but give us a sense at least of what is the feedback in the process on the SIFI de-designation? I mean do you just apply and then wait for a ruling or is there some sort of conversation through the process where you can get a sense of where you stand?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, Scott. So we're the first through the process, okay. So I wouldn't say there's a ton of definition around how the process should work, per se. We are in discussions with the FSOC. They've got our paper. We will walk them through the tenets of our paper. We're in the process of doing that over the next couple of weeks. And then we expect to get a response from the FSOC around the request, and we hope that happens sooner rather than later.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would only add to that, Scott, two things. One is, if you look at the reason for the designation. Our proposal aligns with that in terms of why we don't think we're systemic today; and the other one is just miming what's been said in public. I think people want to see the process work. In other words, I think they want to see that people can come out of SIFI designation just like they can come in, and that's really parroting what people on the FSOC have said.","Operator","The next question is from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey. Just a question on the segment's sort of margin bridge that you laid out. If you look last year as a whole, you take the cost productivity and gross margin, plus the SG&A simplification, that was about a 60 bps tailwind to margins all-in. This quarter it was a negative of 20 bps. So I wondered if there was just some timing on specific productivity measures or if there's something sort of largely going on that explains why the productivity contribution was so muted in Q1?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the page that Jeff walked through which showed cost productivity and gross margins as a 40 basis point drag, I think what you've got to \u2013 I talked about the effect of remeasurement and marks in foreign exchange when I went through results. A lot of that finds itself in gross margins. If you adjust for that, cost productivity was actually up 40 basis points; and that's how you get the 80 basis points of gross margins, excluding the effects of that foreign exchange.","And I didn't say it earlier, but when we look at how those marks and remeasurements peel off over the year against the contracts that they're hedging, about two-thirds of that, of those contracts, settle up in the form of cash in the year. So we would expect two-thirds of what we took as a charge here in the first quarter to come back within the year. So that's why the cost productivity line was a negative 40 basis points. Without foreign exchange, it would have been a plus 40 basis points.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So service was up 4% year-over-year, which is a modest improvement from last quarter's 3%. It looks like your momentum in Power Services and Aviation's increasing. Is there any way to parse out how much of the relatively strong growth is coming from your digital initiative? Jeff, you said in the past that you're expecting to get an additional couple points from digital on service over time. Can you talk about the sustainability of the services momentum, especially as you just rolled out Predix?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, I still expect, in backlog, that you're going to start seeing this flow through. AGPs will be up year-over-year. And we had some good wins in both the Rail business and the Transportation business for the year. I think when you look at orders growing by 29%, we think some of that is going to start echoing through into the run rate of the service business in the second half of this year, into 2017 and 2018. So I still fully expect, along with the service leaders in the business, to have organic services growth at 5% or greater as we look at 2016 and beyond.","Operator","The next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Joe.","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So maybe my one question on Oil & Gas. Clearly, the environment is not great. I felt Lorenzo [Simonelli] did a great job last year of maintaining margins in a very difficult environment, but you seemed to step down in decrementals in the first quarter. I guess maybe can you parse some of that out? How much of it is FX oriented? How much is it the pieces of your business like turbo and the offshore business not doing well enough? Can you parse out what really is driving the decrementals?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So a couple thoughts here. Let's start with the results in the quarter. They reported $308 million of operating margin in the quarter. That included roughly about $90 million of negative FX. And again, as I said earlier, a big part of that FX we do expect to come back during the year.","When you think about the step-down 30%, we're seeing it tougher across all our segments, but it tends to be very concentrated in our Surface business in North America. We got a big step-down there versus our original expectation, and a bit in our Subsea business. The rest of the business, whether it's turbo machinery, downstream, or the old M&C business, we call digital today, those businesses are not that far off the framework we've built when we guided you to 10% to 15%. It's really around Subsea and Surface.","Operator","The next question is from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks and good morning all.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey.","Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Since we have a special guest today as well, it would be helpful to get a better sense on the Alstom backlog. When we also look to the additional risk in the 10-K on engineering and construction risk and all of that, to what extent is that backlog now something \u2013 you've gone over every single project in excruciating detail, have very high levels of conviction on the risk front. How should we think about that playing out going forward?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Steve, I'll start and then Joe can weigh in on the piece of the backlog that he knows. So we have been going through those contracts in extraordinarily amount of detail. We're deeply through it. We're not completely done. I told the team we want to be completely wrapped here in the second quarter so we can lock down purchase accounting. As you would expect, there are some challenges in those contracts around the timing of cash flows and how we forecast revenue to go, how we forecast costs to go, and you've seen some of that in the purchase accounting.","But I would say generally speaking, we are very close to done. And I think in the Power business that Joe can talk to, I think we're in very good shape and we have a deep and good understanding of where we are. Joe?","Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Jeff. The only thing I would add more on the operational side is the team in Power, they've done a really good job at how they've managed the projects, and we see this as an opportunity to grow for the future. With the capability that we've gained around the world on complex expanded-scope projects I think is one of the catalysts for us to keep growing. And we're through our backlog in Gas Power Systems and see that the team does a great job executing projects.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, I would say we've underwritten Alstom with no gross synergies at all. We're clearly going to blow that away, okay? I just think, as Joe went through, HSRGs, Grid, things like that. But I would also say even in \u2013 I just got back from a week or so in Asia. Even in steam power, there are going to be opportunities for GE as we look at the future. So I think that's the way I'd think about it. It's locking down the cost, what Jeff and Joe have talked about. We didn't underwrite any revenue synergies at all, and I think that's going to be the icing on the cake as we go forward.","Operator","The next question is from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you, good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Deane.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","I do want to follow up on the Oil & Gas question because there's certainly been some speculation regarding your potential interest in adding more Oil & Gas assets at this point.","And then a quick one for Jeff Bornstein to update on the cadence of buybacks at $18 billion, how does that sequence out for the balance of the year?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Deane. I'll take the first part of that one. Look, we like for the long-term the Oil & Gas segment. We're going to look at adding to it if it makes sense. We think there's a bunch of different segments in the Oil & Gas business that are attractive as we look at it today, but it's got to make sense in the context of the world we see today and not the rosiest of projections as it pertains to the future. So we're going to be a disciplined buyer when we look at the assets in the Oil & Gas segment. Jeff, how about the second part of the question?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So the way we planned it out, as you saw in the cash flow walk that Jeff took you through, we bought $6.1 billion worth of stock back through the first quarter. Our plan is to buy back roughly 50% in the first half, 50% in the second half, and that's how we're still planning for the dividends to flow from GE Capital, no change versus what we suggested we would do.","Operator","The next question is from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey. I just wanted to make sure I have my arms around the all-in Industrial OP. I assume the $19 billion-plus for the year is still a decent number given that the overall framework hasn't changed? So I guess if you could, address that. But given all the moving parts, anything we should be aware of here in Q2? I'm just making sure we've got this dialed correctly, the H launch, LEAP is coming up. I know you don't want to get into precise Q2 guidance, but a little bit of help there would be good, I think.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, I think, Jeff, I would consider the remixing in the Industrial segments to more or less washout as you go through the puts and takes. on 2Q, Jeff, I don't know, do you want to speak to anything in particular?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","We have a few things. We expect to close Appliances in June, so you'll see the gain associated with Appliances, let's say, roughly $0.20 a share. We expect to do about $0.11 of restructuring in the second quarter as we stand here today. And I think the margin rate in the second quarter, based on LEAP, both launch and initial shipments and H, will get better sequentially every quarter on H cost.","I think the margin rate will be a little bit of a challenge in the second quarter, no change on how we think about it for the year. We talked about 50 basis points of improvement in the core business or the ex-Alstom business, I should say, no change in view on that. But the second quarter could be a little bit challenged with what we've got going on with the LEAP, the H and the wind launch on 2.X and 3.X.","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. As we think about your organic guidance for the year of 2% to 4%, what would it take to get to 2% versus 4%? And is 4% achievable in this environment? Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the hypotheticals are always stuff to stay away from. I think the reason why we had Joe here today is in many ways this is the answer to your question. I mean, I think you got the right product at the right time, well executed, tough comps in the first half, strong comps in the second. And I think if we run the play in gas turbines, it's going to lead us to an organic revenue for the company that's 5%, let's say, in the second half and a range that's 2% to 4% for the year. So I think that was the reason really why we had \u2013 Andrew, why we had Joe here today is that this really is the plus and the minus, if you will, on the year; and I feel good about how we're executing in the Power business.","Operator","The next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Can we maybe try to quantify a little bit more what the total margin impact is this year from these development programs, I mean from the \u2013 or the launch programs, call them I guess the H, the 2.X, 3.X and the LEAP. What's the total kind of margin impact in 2016 and how should we think about that in 2017? At least some kind of ballpark idea of that?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't think we've gone through that. Here's what we've said, Shannon, is notwithstanding the challenge that those present to us from a margin perspective, where despite that through all the investment we've made around restructuring, SG&A costs, the focus on supply chain that we're going to overcome those costs and grow margins roughly 50 basis points in the year ex-Alstom. As we move through to 2017, we expect to be in a very different place on H costs. We think H will be really accretive in 2017 versus 2016.","We expect to get deeper down the curve on the LEAP engine, as volume ramps in 2017 versus 2016. And we expect to be in a better spot certainly around wind, both the 2.X \u2013 2.X is the most important product in 2017 versus 2016. So we haven't detailed out by product exactly what that is. But everything else we're doing around trying to change the cost footprint of this company and around product and service costs within gross margins and running a better supply chain is going to provide us enough headwind to grow margins notwithstanding those incremental costs on those products.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Shannon, we have a product cost counsel that's led by Jeff and Vic Abate and Philippe Cochet. We're tracking all our products as they go through the system. There's a lot because, for instance, as LEAP comes in, GEnx keeps going down the learning curve. So we have a flow of products that are going on inside the company, and I think we just have the line of sight to how, in totality, we're going to generate improvement year-over-year.","Operator","The next question is from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So my initial question was whether the mix of the guidance for the full year is unchanged. And it sounds like that's not the case, it sounds like it's very much in line despite the Oil & Gas down. Maybe, if you could, just confirm that. But I did want to ask Joe a question on the H as well. Clearly, similar efficiency for the H compared to Siemens and (59:03) is one to two points better, which is huge. How do you maintain that advantage going forward? What is the development path for the H from here and how do you think about the price, the market share dynamic here? Are you planning to monetize this at price, or at this point do you want to drive market share?","Joseph R. Mastrangelo - President & CEO, Gas Power Systems, GE Power, General Electric Co.","So, Nigel, where I'd start off is that in two years we've gone from single-digit to 40% share of the space. So the technology we have today plays well in the marketplace because the customers get the incremental valuable from the output and the efficiency side. As I talked about on my last page, the key for us and everything that we're doing around digital, industrial, fast works, we now can develop technology on these gas turbines on a continuous basis.","Where this was discrete in the past and you would do a move every five years or 10 years, we're doing this continuously. We've already done four models on the gas turbine today and there's a roadmap to continue to push the thermal efficiency above 62%; and our plan is to get it to 65%, and we see that both from what we can do on the gas turbine and what we bring in from Alstom on the combined cycle basis. And that's the roadmap we have to stay ahead of the competition.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say, Nigel, I would echo with what Joe said. The Alstom pieces I think give us a window that's greater than what we had anticipated even before we completed the deal, which I think is quite a positive. And then, Jeff, I think the first question was there's no change on really the mix on gross margin.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think just to nail that one, I think, Nigel, even with Oil & Gas, I don't think we see...","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I didn't understand that that was the question. But yes, (1:00:42) launch for the year \u2013 with the launches, but that's all wrapped up in our 50 basis point margin improvement.","Operator","And our final question comes from Robert McCarthy with Stifel.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for fitting me in.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Rob.","Robert McCarthy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey. It looks like overnight you did about $100 million deal for Daintree Networks in Australia and basically in the network lighting space. And part of the rationale, at least from Daintree's standpoint, they're very excited about the Predix opportunity for lighting controls. Maybe you could talk a little bit about is this the change in the margin in terms of how you're thinking about investing in that business?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the way I would look at this, Rob, is this was a system deal that allows us in kind of the LED space to do a better job with controls. So I would view this as kind of a one-off from the standpoint of this was just a very unique technology that had a very good fit with doing these systems. Now kind of what Jeff said in the past, so what Beth and the rest of the team has said, we're going to get this year some very big LED orders from commercial real estate people and things like that. So we're going to be at a run rate that's substantially over $1 billion. But the Daintree control fit has really allowed us to build a system, and this was a classic make-versus-buy call that just allows us to accelerate...","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It was absolutely a critical component to making these things work, no question.","Matthew G.

Please proceed.","Trevor Schauenberg","Thank you, Shanelle. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s second quarter 2012 earnings webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release earlier this morning, and the presentation slides are available via the webcast.

Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light. For today\u2019s webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and our Vice Chairman and CFO, Keith Sherin.","Now, I'd like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks Trevor and good morning everyone. The GE team had another good quarter and let me start by giving you few of the main points. First, we are confident in our earnings outlook for 2012, we remain on track for double-digit, industrial and financial earnings growth for the year. And we restarted the GE Capital dividend returning $3 billion for the parent in the second quarter.","The environment continues to be challenging, the U.S. is stable, the appliance market grew by 1%, but housing starts up more than 30% that bodes well for future. Railroad links were up 1.2% and our retail volume and our private label credit card business is up 9%. We saw solid growth in the emerging markets with revenue up 17% and Europe remains very tough but within our expectations. ","Our revenue was strong with organic growth of 10%, orders up 1% and up 3% ex-win. And through the first half orders are up 8%. Orders pricing was up 1.2% and foreign exchange impacted revenue by $900 million for the quarter.","Earnings grew by 12% better than planned. Capital, energy, oil & gas, transportation, appliances were strong, disc ops continues to be a headwind. And we have a very strong cash from liquidity position. We bought back $900 million of stock in the second quarter and plan to do an additional 3.5 to $4.5 billion by year-end. Margins are improving and we are on track for margin growth starting in the third quarter for 2012 and 2013. ","Overall, the team continues to make progress. Orders are up 8% year-to-date and consistent with our plans for the year. For the quarter, orders were about flat, it's important to explain the impact of two unusual items, foreign exchange and strong win orders of 2011. This kind of the impact of these factors orders were up about 3% in the second quarter and in energy equipment orders were up about 9%.","Orders pricing was a highlight with four or five businesses and we continue to build backlog. Europe remains weak particularly in service. Our orders position today supports our growth plans for the future. ","Our investment growth continues to pay off. Our growth market revenue is about 17% with 7 of 9 regions experiencing double-digit gain. For instant China was up 24% and Latin America was up 50%, services grew by 2% and backlog grew by $4 billion. And our NPI continues to work. ","We won big in Farnborough with $17 billion of new aviation commitment. Our Mission 5 refrigerator sold out and we have two more plant product launching in third quarter. We are expanding our battery plant, our platform in Russia is resulting in new gas turbine orders and high market share. We have a very strong product line in healthcare. ","Orders growth in the second quarter for MI was up 10% and CT was 12% and writing value in our acquisition. So in these volatile markets we were winning commercially. We made progress in our margin commitment, we expect margins to grow starting in the third quarter, and to be up 30 to 50 basis points in 2012 and 100 basis points over \u201812 and \u201813.","At EPG, I described our products to margins and the second quarter value GAAP was positive $100 million. Service margins grew by 10 basis points. And our acquisitions were ahead of plan, although still a drag overall. ","I often said that we reduce structural cost by $2 billion between \u201812 and \u201814 by simplifying GE, and you saw some of that today with the elimination of the top energy structure. There are some benefits to move for investors. But all of the acquisitions our energy business have become very big and complex, power and water will remain GE\u2019s largest industrial business. We are benefiting from a positive gas turbine cycle. Oil and gas is about 15 billion in revenue and we are positioned throughout the growth. And energy management at $7 billion have several solid growth platforms. ","These moves will allow us to become faster and more focus to win in these markets. At the same time we get transparency around three large and important segments that all have different opportunity for growth and are led by strong management teams. And we expect to eliminate 2 to $300 million of cost. Actions like this always done carefully at GE, John and I have been working on this for some time, and both feel it is right for the company.","As you can see by our second quarter results, our energy business is doing very well. We expect the second half in energy to be very strong and we are well positioned for 2013 and beyond. John and I will work on a smooth transition in the third quarter with three leaders reporting directly to me in the fourth quarter. John leads the energy business in great shape. ","It captures a great story with capital dividend worth $6.8 billion in the first half of 55%, this is ahead of our expectation. Working capital is impacted as we prepare for high shipment in the second half. We end the quarter with $74 billion of consolidated cash. And there is another piece of good news, due to changes in pension funding requirements, our pension cash needs will be reduced by $2.5 billion in \u201812 and \u201813. ","Now let me turn it over to Keith. ","Keith Sherin","Jeff thanks. I\u2019m going to start with the second quarter summary. As you can see we had continuing operations revenues of $36.5 billion, that\u2019s reported up 2% but we were impacted by the stronger dollar [after-tax] revenue were up 5%. ","Industrial sales of 25.1 billion were up 9%, decapital revenues of 11.5 billion were down 8% consistent with our plant shrinkage. Operating earnings of 4 billion were up 7%, operating earnings per share of $0.38 were up 12%. ","Continuing earnings per share includes the impact of the non-operating pension and net earnings per share includes the impact of discontinued operations reflecting the $0.05 of charges this quarter, which I will cover on the next page. ","As Jeff covered, year-to-date cash of 6.8 million was up 55% including the 3 billion of cash from GE Capital. For taxes the GE rate of 20% consistent with a low 20s rate, we forecast at the end of the first quarter, and the year-to-date rate for GE is 22%. The 5% GE Capital rate thus lower than the approximately 10% rate we previously forecast, the lower rate largely due to the business property disposition tax benefit that I\u2019m going to cover on the next page. ","With the impact on the year from the business property disposition, the tax benefits we get with that, that\u2019s going to allow us to shrink real estate a lot more quickly. We now expect a mid single-digit GE Capital rate for the year.","On the right side, you can see the segment results, industrial revenues were up 9%, industrial segment profit was up 7%, that\u2019s driven by the double-digits growth in energy, oil & gas, transportation, and GE Capital earnings were up 31%. So, I\u2019m going to cover each of the segments in more detail on the page or two, but let\u2019s start with the other items in the quarter.","As you know GE real estate announced the sale of its business properties business. We had $0.02 of tax benefit in the second quarter from the high tax basis we have in the shares of the entity that we are selling. This transaction is expected to close hopefully by the fourth quarter, and will result in $5 billion of lower real estate ending that investment. The BP tax benefit here is recorded in the GE Capital headquarters results in the second quarter, so you won\u2019t see that in real estate you will see that in corporate and capital. ","We also had a $0.02 after-tax and restructuring and other charges in the quarter, the charges primarily related to continued cost structure improvement at GE Capital, energy, healthcare, corporate and we also had one-time cost related to the acquisitions. ","And on the bottom of the page we had $0.05 charge related to our WMC and Grey Zone reserved this quarter. I will start with Grey Zone. ","We did see daily claims reductions in the range of what we are expecting in our models in December and January, but since then we have seen an uptick in the claims number over the last few months and the increases are above what we modeled. The claims severity, the amount per claim is running within our modeled expectations, but because of the higher claims we booked 310 million of additional reserves, and that reflects a slower overall claims reduction rate than we previously modeled. And we ended the quarter with $695 million of reserve.","For WMC, at the end of the second quarter there were 2.7 billion of pending claims up from 562 million last quarter. You saw that in the first quarter 10-Q that the claims were increasing. This acceleration in the quarter, we think is driven by statute of limitation considerations, but we saw an uptick above what we expected. And the reserve that we booked is based on historical WMC experience, plus it includes an estimate for future claims. ","The WMC ended the quarter with 491 million of reserves up from 140 million in the first quarter. And we are going to continue to monitor both of these items but we believe the exposure is manageable. So, let me go on to the businesses. The first business is energy infrastructure. And I will begin with the energy segment. ","Energy had a strong quarter in Q2, orders of 7.8 billion were down 6% driven by the non-repeat of last year\u2019s wind orders. Equipment orders of 4.4 billion were down 5%, our thermal orders of 1.4 billion were up 10%. We had orders for 30 gas turbines in Q2 versus 41 last year, however, we also had orders five steam turbines this year versus one last year. And we had higher thermal order pricing.","Wind orders of 900 million were down 37%, equipment orders ex-wind were up 9%, and we had orders for 428 units versus 668 last year. Total equipment order pricing for the energy business is up 2.7% and thermal is up 5%, and renewable pricing is also up 5%. So a nice turn there.","Equipment orders even including wind are up 9% year-to-date. So, a little bit of this is wind and a little bit is just the timing of orders and we feel pretty good about where we are. Service orders of 3.4 billion were down 8%, that\u2019s driven by lower upgrades and outage services, we did see customers continue to run their gas turbine equipment as a result of low natural gas prices in the quarter. ","The aero services were down as a result of tough comparison for last year we booked 10 on a rental units were Japan. And revenues of 8.6 billion were up 19% driven by all the strong volume. ","Renewable revenues led the way 1.8 billion that was up 160%. We shipped 726 wind turbines versus 269 last year. And thermal revenue of 1.6 billion was down 20%. We shipped 31 gas turbine versus 32 last year with mixed differences. ","Both gas engines and aero derivatives had strong volume growth and service revenue of 3.7 billion was up 4%. Segment profit of 1.3 billion was up 15% and that\u2019s driven by the strong volume that we saw in the product lines. ","On the second business in energy, oil & gas, we had another strong quarter. Orders of 4.1 billion were up 1%. They were up 6% ex the impact of the strong dollar. Equipment orders of 2 billion were down 8% driven by tough comparison in the last year, however, again if you look at year-to-date equipment orders for oil & gas they were up 21%, and service orders of 2.1 billion were up 11%. The orders price index for the business was up 1.8%. ","Geographically, we continue to see strong growth in Asia-Pacific up 60%, North America was up 27%, Middle East was up 19% that was partially offset by Western Europe which was down 17%, and Australia was where we headed the large one-time orders last year. So, that gives us some tough comparison. ","Revenue of 3.7 billion was up 5%, equipment revenue 1.7 billion was flat and up 6% FFX. And service revenues of 2 billion were up 10%. Segment profit 535 million was up 11% as the strong volume and positive price more than offset the negative impact of foreign exchange on the business. So, overall a really nice strong quarter in energy and we have a very good outlook as we look to the second half.","Next is aviation, orders of 5.6 billion up 5%, commercial engine orders of 1.3 billion were down 19%, TFM 56% orders were up 12% and orders for GE 90 and TF 34 were down in the quarter. ","Military equipment orders of 1.2 billion were up 200% driven by (inaudible) foreign military orders, and the equipment order book-to-bill in the business was 1.22. Service orders of 2.6 billion were down 3% driven by commercial services, our second quarter average daily order rate of 20.6 million per day which was down 14% partially offset by our long-term service agreement orders which were up 5%. ","The total orders price index was positive at 2.2%. And if you look from a market perspective in aviation, the year-to-date passenger traffic is up 6.5% through May. Cycle flown had been about flat over the last 12 months. However, we continue to see the impact of customer\u2019s working capital actions. For example in Western Europe, our spares orders were down 34%, and right now our expectation for the second half this is going to recover somewhat. We don\u2019t expect to get back to last year\u2019s levels, but we do expect it to prove over what we saw in the second quarter.","Revenue of 4.9 billion was up 3% driven by strong equipment volume partially offset by the lower spare sales. We shipped 566 commercial engines in the quarter versus 473 last year, and we shipped 27 GEnx engines up from 4 last year. Segment profit of 922 million was down 4% as the benefit of positive price and lower based cost were more than offset by the lower spares. ","On the right side transportation. They delivered another great quarter, orders of 1.4 billion were up 2% and for the first half orders were up 29%. Equipment orders of 808 million were down 3%, lower mining orders more than offset higher locomotive orders. Service orders of 590 million were up 10%, and the orders pricing was up 1.1%. ","Revenue of 1.6 billion was up 27% driven by the strong volume. We shipped 243 locomotives versus 163 last year. We also shipped 195 locomotive [kits] versus 94 last year, and mining equipment was up over 30%.","For the first half we shipped 402 locomotives and our estimate for the total year is around 650 units. Segment profit of 282 million was up 58% driven by the strong volume, positive pricing and positive results.","Next is healthcare. Orders of 4.7 billion were up 1%. This business was also impacted by a strong dollar, up 4% ex-FX. Equipment orders of 2.7 billion were up 4% driven by strong growth in emerging markets partially offset by Europe. If you just go around the regions on equipment orders. The U.S. was flat, China was up 26, Latin America was up 9%, Middle East was up 13%, India was down 8% but up 9% ex-FX, Europe was the soft point down 13% driven by Southern Europe. And just a few numbers by modality. Global ECG was up 12%, MR was up 10%, Life Sciences were up 6% and the pet business was down 14%.","Service orders of 2 billion were down 2% also driven by Europe down 10%, and revenues of 4.5 billion were flat or up 3% FX adjusted. Emerging markets were up 11% offsetting the developed markets which were down 2%.","Segment profit of 694 million was down 2% as the benefits of the volume and productivity were more than offset by negative price and we had execution challenges of about 30 million in Latin America. Excluding those we would have had healthcare up about 2% in the quarter.","On the business solutions it had another tough quarter but we did see some positive signs in appliances, revenues of 2.2 billion were up 2% as appliances revenues were up 10% partially offset by lighting revenue which was down 8%. ","If you look at appliances, retail sales were up 11%, contract sales were up 22% we saw strong pickup in housing starts. Appliances saw 5 points of price increase in the quarter and at the same time we increased share again reflecting the benefit of the investments we have been making in new products over the last 18 months.","As you know we introduced a new bottom freezer refrigerator this quarter, it was sold out, we are doubling the production rate and the offset is in lighting. We saw volume pressure in the U.S. and Europe driven by lower condensed sales. Segment profit of 91 million was driven by appliances and the benefits of higher pricing were more than offset by inflation and lower lighting volume. ","Next is GE Capital. Mike Neal and the team delivered another very positive quarter, revenue of 11.5 billion was down 8% in line with the assets which were down 7%. Net income of 2.1 billion was up 31% as driven by lower impairments principally in real estate, plus we have the one-time tax benefits that are covered on the other item stage and that was partially offset by some of the dispositions we have been making up with shrink GE Capital.","I\u2019ll cover all of those items by business in a minute. We ended the quarter with 433 billion of ending investment already below our original 440 billion target for the year, and we are on our way to about 425 billion for the end of the year. Our net interest margin was 4.9% up 47 basis points and then more details on GE Capital and margins and capital levels and their supplemental facts that we posted this morning. ","On the right side you can see the asset quality metrics continue to be good as delinquencies fell and CLL real estate and the U.S. retail they were up slightly in mortgage and that\u2019s a seasonal effect that we see. A big highlight is the continued improvement in commercial real estate. We also saw strong volume, good margins we continue to shrink our non-core assets. And even after paying the 3 billion dividend, our tier 1 common ended the quarter at 10.1% up 4 point over last year. ","So, if you look at some of the business results, the commercial lending and leasing business, if you look assets were down 7% year-over-year driven by non-core run off. Commercial volumes in the Americas was 7.7 billion up 2% and returns on new volume remained at 2% return on investment.","Earnings at 626 million were down 11% that was mostly impacted by 60 million of year-over-year price in Italy from credit cost. Even with that our European business earned over 50 million in the quarter and the Americas earned 527 million which was down 3%. ","Our consumer results were better than the reported variant shows assets were down 7% it had somewhat driven by foreign exchange and non-core run off and that partially offset by 5 billion of growth in the U.S. retail business. Earnings of 907 million were down 13% again driven by last year\u2019s exit of Colpatria and other non-core assets. The U.S. retail business had a great quarter, they earned 641 million up 9% on higher assets and higher margins.","Europe, core business earned 154 million up 13% on lower credit cost and UK home lending had another good quarter earning $45 million in the quarter and the portfolio of quality remains stable.","Real estate was the driver in the earnings growth in the quarter, net income of 221 million that\u2019s up 555 million over last year is up 160 million from first quarter. The earnings were driven by lower marks and impairments, one-time tax benefits and lower credit cost.","In the quarter we had 5 million of after-tax credit cost, 19 million of after-tax marks and impairments it's the lowest level we had in years. We sold 55 properties for $700 million resulting in 53 million of gains. And so the improvements that we have seen in liquidity and valuations continued in the second quarter and as of now we expect the real estate business to remain profitable as we look into Q3 and Q4. ","GECAS had another good quarter, assets were up 2% driven by string volume at over 3% ROI. Earnings of 308 million were down 4% driven by too small credit losses and the portfolio of quality here continues to be strong. We have 56 million of non-earnings in the whole portfolio and only three aircraft on the ground of over 1500 aircraft.","Energy, financial services earnings are 122 million were down 12%, we had 850 million of volume in the quarter at approximately 5% return. So, another great quarter for GE Capital. If you look at the Q2 earnings of 2.1 billion from a run rate perspective going forward, I take a few items into consideration. First the BP tax benefits that I covered I don\u2019t repeat at the Q2 amount as you go into the second half. ","Second, the third quarter includes our annual GECAS impairment review which you are all familiar with. Last year the impact of that was 107 million after-tax, I don\u2019t know whether it will be this year, I just gave you last year\u2019s numbers for context.","And third, we are expecting that retail reserves will be higher as they are usually are in the third quarter. Seasonally, last year retail credit cost increased to 188 million after-tax from Q2 to Q3. ","So, with that let me turn it back to Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Thanks Keith. And now to the operating framework, we want to confirm our operating framework for the year. We expect industrial earnings to grow double-digits. Energy is going to have a very strong second half, and margins will be positive in the third quarter and for the year. Capital earnings will grow double-digits, commercial real estate has improved dramatically and Europe is manageable. ","Our corporate is on track and we will offset any gains with restructuring. Cash expectations are being revised upward because of the capital dividend and pension change. We now expect 17 to $19 billion of CFOA for the year. Organic industrial revenue growth should continue to expand 5 to 10% and we will continue to shrink GE Capital. So, we have a very solid outlook for 2012 and good momentum as we (inaudible) for 2013.","Finally, I think there is a lot of positive news reports for investors, we have a solid industrial outlook, we have a big backlog and margin performance, is on track, for the expansion we communicated at EPG, we are getting cash from GE Capital and we will continue to position to be a smaller more valuable franchise. We have a lot of cash, we plan to use the $4.5 billion capital special dividend to buyback additional stock, and those efforts will accelerate in the third quarter. Meanwhile, we will continue to grow the GE dividend line with earnings. ","So, in a volatile environment, GE is positioned for double-digit earnings growth and valuable capital allocation. And this is a powerful combination for investors. ","So, Trevor let me turn it back over to you and let\u2019s take some questions.","Trevor Schauenberg","Great Jeff. Shanelle, we are ready to go the questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","So, just on the aviation front, you are up down pretty dramatically but the margin were still okay, and in spite you said it's going to improve a little bit in the back half, how we think about aviation margin as we kind of turn the corner in the back half and then third quarter.","Jeff Immelt","Well, I think if you look at the quarter, we were 19% margins down from 20 last year. Really the good news in aviation, the good news bad news, our margins as we are getting tremendous equipment growth and then we have a negative on equipment service mix. I\u2019d expect that you are going to continue to see that, we have a tremendous backlog on a commercial equipment but you have seen a couple other points on aviation. The R&D as a percent of revenue was leveled off. They are controlling their cost and the improvements that they have made on everything they are doing with launch of the GEnx continue to help us as we look at the pressure that the GEnx engine delivers. So, for me, I think if you look the orders for aviation were down, spare orders were down in the quarter. We went down from in quarter, last year first quarter was 23 a day, second quarter was 20.6, last year it was 27 in the third quarter. We do not anticipate that we are going to get back to that level, but I do anticipate that and the business is forecasting that we will be up in the mid single-digit over the second quarter levels that we saw. So, I think aviation is one that we are confident about the outlook for the year, being positive in terms of our profit. ","In the third quarter there is one item, last year we had a gain if you remember it's about $70 million I won\u2019t repeat. In the third quarter I\u2019m not anticipating a really big margin number for these guys but we do anticipate an improvement (inaudible) second quarter. And we do anticipate that they will positive on our profit for the year. ","Steve Tusa - JPMorgan","And then, just one last question on the energy business. Thermal pricing up 5%, orders were down obviously a pretty tough comp. How booked are you guys from the thermal perspective. How booked are you guys for next year, my guess is your visibility is obviously getting better as you get closer there. Do we expect more orders here in the second half of the year given that, I think your book-to-bill is still below one in thermal but the pricing is obviously picking up, very nicely shown in the markets timing which is a positive. But I guess, can you give us a sense as to how (inaudible) assume a flat growth here in turbine.","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have the exact turbine number but I\u2019d say right now our business is about flat with what we normally would see in terms of booked orders and we are about normal like commitments that our things as a team is working as you look to a flat year in gas turbines for next year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Davis - Barclays","Can you give us a little bit of color on how the timing and why John Krenicki is leaving (inaudible).","Keith Sherin","John and I have been working on this for 6 or 9 months. With all of the acquisitions and everything we had $50 billion company within a company. And I think from our standpoint really is an operating company. I think the idea to get a little bit faster and more focused on those three businesses seem to be a logical position. And I think John saw the same way. We discussed him taking other roles inside the company, and I think his sense it's a good time to think about other things that you can do. John and I work for 25 years, I think this is just one of those natural evolutions in GE that we do as time goes on to better match up with the markets. ","Scott Davis - Barclays","One of the questions we get quite a lot is kind of where you guys want to be in mining for long-term. And (inaudible) to talk about what\u2019s your strategy in mining is and (inaudible).","Keith Sherin","What I\u2019d say is you got positioning around, we already have a big business in propulsion, we already got a pretty big business in power conversion and kind of around the mine. It\u2019s our footprint from a standpoint of product, service, global footprint, energy, water. So, we have a nice package of products for it. I kind of look at it at the same way I looked at oil & gas 10 years ago. I don\u2019t see doing big acquisition. I think we can grow sequentially. So, I\u2019d look at it as a good additional segment where we are about $2 billion in revenue a year. We can grow probably 10% in an orderly way. Relatively high margins and do it overtime. It's a nice way to leverage our footprint. But I don\u2019t think you are going to see anything big or sudden from us as it pertains to mining. ","Operator","The next question comes from Terry Darling with Goldman Sachs.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","I wonder if you talk little more about your margin confidence both for the second half and for \u201813, I guess in the second half aviation is pretty locked in loaded. But maybe come back to the execution challenge on the ramp up in wind volumes and how you feel like supply chain as looking in that context to start. And then Jeff on 2013, talking about 100 basis points of expansion there, maybe you can talk a little bit about what you see is the drivers there and how contingent that is on the global macro growth rates you implied.","Jeff Immelt","I think if you go back to EPG we said 30 to 50 basis point this year and 100 basis point in total over \u201812 and \u201813, right. And I think that\u2019s kind of the still the way we look at it. SO, if you take a look we go positive in Q3. Energy drives the big chunk of that I think we are kind of hitting our sweet spot a little bit in the energy and we see that to be very strong. We also see good expansion in our transportation business. We have some easy comps in home and business solutions that will make margins enhancement there actually relatively easy. Keith talked about the aviation margin outlook. In healthcare we have some execution issues that shouldn\u2019t repeat going in the third quarter. So, I see healthcare going positive in Q3 as well. So, we will have basically four or five segments positive in Q3 with energy actually very strong in that context.","And if you think about the big levers we have got, we have got value gap, I think value gap is positive and we remain positive going in the \u201913. You have got service margins, service margins continue to be positive both this year and next. We got simplification, you have seen what our goals are. And then we have got product cost, and I have got a ton of projects going around the company, we get our product cost down. So, I think on the macro side, kind of we prepared ourselves for pretty tough year this year, and certainly a volatile year. We haven\u2019t been disappointed. We have seen that volatility play through particularly in Europe. And we are going to be equally prepared when you think about \u201913. So, I\u2019d see margin expansion this year between 30 and 50 basis points. And then next year I think that will make up for the total of 100. So, between let\u2019s say 50 to 70 basis points next year. And then you are going to have between let\u2019s say 13 and 11. You are going to have at least 100 basis points of expansion over that time period. And I actually see that turning the corner and I think third quarter is going to be pretty good. ","Keith Sherin","The close in the second quarter and if you look at the margin, performance and energy and the margin performance across the portfolio, down 20 basis points versus the first quarter down more than that down 50. I feel really good about the progress we are making and return to value gap positive as Jeff said, R&D as a percent of revenue is going into a positive, total cost productivity is positive and the only issue we are wrestling with is service equivalent mix here in the second quarter, that\u2019s a good news. ","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","So, I mean confidence in the margins despite the softer macro out there, company determined factors and the mix here I guess, and obviously that\u2019s quite positive. In terms of the macro impact on your thinking on orders over the balance of the year. Is that softened up a little bit presumably or is there more company determined self directed share gains and so forth there. I think at one point you have been thinking double-digits, where 8% through the first half. How are you thinking about that.","Jeff Immelt","I think our orders, we basically have said that our organic revenue target is up 5 to 10%. Our orders growth basically supports that. I\u2019d expect our orders to continue to grow for the year, I think FX adjusted in high single-digits in that range as the year goes on. We build an incredible backlog over the last period of times. So, we have got a big equipment and service backlog and so, we have drawn kind of positive book-to-bill ratios for long time. So, I think some of that has to be factored in as well, in terms of when you look at new orders.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","And then just lastly to clean up on WMC, I guess two parts. One, the statute of limitations comment Keith you are thinking end of this year is statute of limitations on what the \u201806 advantages and so that\u2019s why this doesn\u2019t look like it has a long tail. And did I hear the reserve really didn\u2019t change a whole lot even though the claims went up dramatically. And maybe I missed something there, but can you explain that. ","Keith Sherin","The statute of limitations is, I\u2019m not giving any legal advice but the limit that we are seeing that people are reacting to is six years. And so you are right in terms of the timing by the end of this year that gets down to very small numbers of mortgages that are out there, past that period. And that, it seems to be what drove the spike in claims that happened in the quarter. Our reserve did increase dramatically. It went from $140 million at the end of first quarter to $491 million at the end of second quarter, Terry.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","","But the 491 relative to, what were the claims in the quarter?","Keith Sherin","","Well, we have that claims balance was 562 at the end of first quarter, went to 2.7. I think the thing that you can't see in that, that there our reserve balances anticipate future claims. Incurred but not reported, it\u2019s called. So at the end of the first quarter, the balance of reserve relative to 562 had some future claims, estimates in there. At the second quarter we have increased that estimate of future claims, it\u2019s not quite -- it\u2019s less than 100% of the known claims balance but it\u2019s a significant number.","Terry Darling - Goldman Sachs","So just on disc-ops, you know EPS from disc-ops or loss from disc-ops was down for the year. Presumably that number goes a little higher as we move into the back part of the year.","Keith Sherin","Well, we think we have reserved appropriately. You know I think the problem is that you just have to watch these long tail liabilities. We anticipate a significant additional amount of claims in WMC, we will have to see how we do against that. And in Grey Zone, we need to see those claims decline as we go through the second half of the year. Right now we believe we are appropriately reserved.","Operator","Out next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So Keith, maybe could you walk through the big components of the $555 million year-over-year increase in real estate?","Keith Sherin","Sure. If you look at the variance on earnings -- let me get the right numbers for you. Lower marks and impairments, so we had 7 million of credit costs and on a variance item versus last year that\u2019s s couple of hundred million dollars of benefit. $256 million on marks and impairments. And we also had, the last year we had real estate losses that were not tax effected, so that was something that increased probably the one time benefits in there, a little over $100 million in the quarter for real estate. And the base income is better from the core of business on earnings on both the debt and the equity portfolio. I mean at the end of the day when you look at what really has happened is when you go do global valuations, we did not have declines and valuations on either the debt or the equity book and that just changes the profile of earnings and real estate. And then you earned a little bit by selling some properties and having some gains.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","So I mean relative to this, you said the tax rate didn\u2019t run through that, I mean the tax...","Keith Sherin","No, the sale of BP is not in here but last year we had losses that were not tax affected, and as a result this year by having none of that you have an improvement year-over-year in taxes.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. But sequentially moving forward it doesn\u2019t sound like there is anything that unusual in this 220 number.","Keith Sherin","I think you know you are plus or minus $50 million-$70 million on a run rate from taxes. Other than that I think if we don\u2019t have any valuation changes than you continue to see the market where we are. We feel pretty good about the outlook for the business.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","Okay. And then just on the pricing in energy, gas and wind turbine is down on units but the pricing is up, I mean last year the pricing was down a bunch in those segments, particularly in 2Q. I mean was some of this easy comp or was it mix or does that all feel real to you?","Keith Sherin","Help me out with what you are on, are you on orders or sales?","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","I am no orders. So I think you said up 5 last year, there some significant order pricing declines on orders.","Keith Sherin","Absolutely.","Jeff Immelt","You know, Shannon, I think there is always mix, kind of falling through this and I am not sure that it\u2019s going to be up five forever. But I do think we have seen it firming in commitments, we have seen that starting to flow through and I think we expect a decent pricing environment going forward.","Keith Sherin","I mean you can see it swinging right. You know as you said last year, Q1, Q2, Q3, down six, down ten, down seven on thermal. Q4 down 12, Q1 was down one, Q2 was up five. Our estimate for the year right now is this should be somewhere around flat but it\u2019s definitely changed the dynamics of supply and demand here on pricing front.","","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","And just last clarification from me. You offset the lower tax rate in the quarter with restructuring GE Capital. Now it can be lower for the whole year. Are you going to ramp your structuring to offset the incremental benefit or how is that going to work?","Keith Sherin","Well, it is in the detail for the run rate. Now you are somewhere in the mid-single digits. So the disconnect in the quarter was the capital benefits of tax were in GE Capital and the restructuring was mostly in corporate. But right now it will be in the capital run rate at somewhere in the mid-single digits.","Shannon O'Callaghan - Nomura Securities","But for the second half we now have a lower capital tax rate then we assumed before. Are you going to offset that 5% difference with some more restructuring or is it just going to flow through.","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have it planned that way. We are looking at restructuring associated with the cost out and we are evaluating what we can do to continue to accelerate the actions to simplify the company and improve our margins. So there are activities we are working on but we don\u2019t have it planned that way Shannon.","Operator","The next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi.","Deane Dray - Citi","For GE Capital and specifically commercial lending, can you comment on net interest margin on new business being written versus business that\u2019s rolling off?","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have that number Deane. I will have to have probably get back to you with it.","Jeff Immelt","But I think the net interest margin is very positive. Like most of the metrics being around margins are improving but I think we can get you....","Keith Sherin","For (inaudible)...","Jeff Immelt","We can give you what the flow through is.","Deane Dray - Citi","Do you have it broadly for capital? Because that had been a data point in the recovery that we saw, significantly better net interest margin...?","Keith Sherin","It was up 50 basis points year-over-year.","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think NIM captures some of that, I think Deane.","Deane Dray - Citi","Okay. And then on the tier one comment, just to make sure I have the math right. With the resumption of the dividend that does put some pressure on tier one. It may be by 20 basis points or so, but can you calibrate the impact there?","Keith Sherin","Well, the earnings more than offset it in the capital ratios. If you look in the supplemental charts that we have sent out, there is a breakdown of the impact on the tier one ratios from earnings growth, foreign exchange and dividends.","Deane Dray - Citi","And then lastly, Keith, can you comment on how the tax benefits should help provide some ability to take down GE Capital assets faster. Will that be towards the red assets? And is that still about $80 billion in expectations for the balance of the year?","Keith Sherin","I think the example we are using here is business properties. We had an opportunity, we have a negotiated transaction to sell $5 billion of real estate assets. The fact that there is a tax benefit associated with the structuring enables us to remove $5 billion of assets that were earning around $50 million. So it\u2019s a onetime transaction and it\u2019s an example. (inaudible). For us shrinking $5 billion of real estate is a good move strategically for the GE capital business.","Jeff Immelt","You know, Deane, if you think back over the last few years, we beat every commitment on the side of GE Capital. And one of the things I said at EPT is that I think we are all aligned behind as to continue to make GE Capital smaller and more focused. And we are going to continue to do that and I think BP is a good transaction for us.","Keith Sherin","Yeah. The red ending investments of about $75 billion, it\u2019s around 17% year-over-year. And the BP transaction is a good example of the team continuing to do a good job of running these assets. Now if you look at the supplemental you can see the dividend was 60 basis points on the tier one. And the earnings added 30 basis points and that\u2019s pretty much why we went from 10.1 to 10.4 from Q1 to Q2. And even with that though, if you look year-over-year, we are at 10.1, a whole point up even with the dividend, on tier one common. And in addition when you look at total capital, the preferred stock that we issued enabled us to build our non-common tier one capital and still enabled us to pay a dividend of $3 billion to the parent, keep the capital ratios above what we think we need to have.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","So first question on the order growth rate. How much -- to what extent did acquisitions contributed at all to that number. What would it have been organically?","Keith Sherin","The total was about -- yeah, most of the acquisitions now as you get through the second quarter are all in the run rates.","Jeff Immelt","And FX was what, about...","Keith Sherin","2 points.","Jeff Immelt","Two. So about two. Yeah. So it was kind of flattish.","Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. And then on the GE Capital reserving front. I think that was page nine in the supplemental. You know you talked about the environment continuing to improving, continuing to improve, reserves coming down to 1.86% now from, I guess 2.26 in the second quarter of \u201911. Just give us a sense maybe on the environmental side, I mean obviously a lot of this is driven by the U.S. and by your activity that you are seeing, but at the same time we are seeing so much uncertainty and volatility globally. And with what's going on in Europe and you guys have a fair bit of assets over there. So how do you think about this? Being able to take reserves down relative to...?","Keith Sherin","","You know the reserves aren\u2019t being taken down, the write-offs are in excess of the reserves. We had about $100 million of impact of the balances of reserves from FX. But if you look at the numbers by business, the delinquencies are down in every single set of our operations except for the mortgage which is up seasonally. Non-earnings are down in every single one of our businesses. Our write-offs are down in every single one of our businesses, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for all three of those metrics. So we continue to have a portfolio that shows improvements in its performance. And I think you are getting to run rate levels of new provisions on new business. And the only thing that will change that will be the mix between retail which obviously is higher reserve levels and the commercial which has lower reserve levels.","Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","But are you seeing that the -- question is in terms of the progression to the quarter maybe or any kind of risk as you look out where you feel like that provision rate is in any way at risk as we head into what is potentially a more difficult macro environment?","Jeff Immelt","Well, we have been in that environment for quite some time in Europe. I think the team has had to take a lot of operating actions, right. We have been very prudent from a risk perspective on increasing our underwriting standards. We have lowered our open lines on credits that were less creditworthy, in Europe. I mean it\u2019s a full core press from the risk team about reducing our exposures in places where we don\u2019t want to have them. We had to add reserves and take some provisions in Italy. I think that\u2019s a tough place. You know previous quarter we had some in Hungary, but that stabilized. That was really a legislative change on mortgages. You know we are watching the Spain consumer business, that\u2019s obviously a tough place. But things like the UK continue to perform, non-earnings are down, delinquencies are down. Delinquencies were up a little bit seasonally but they are less then what normally we would have. And the main drivers as we shrink that book, the non-earning assets and the delinquencies are a higher percent, it\u2019s not that they are going up in terms of dollars.","So I think that the risk team has done a really good job in cooperation with the operating team. But right we are at run rate levels if we have specific things that happen we will reserve for them. The biggest change you are seeing across this portfolio is obviously the improvement of real estate values globally. Both the debt and the equity book in the quarter, from a valuation perspective on the work that we did on the assets that were covered, had increases in the valuations. That\u2019s the first time in years you know versus the pressure we have had in the equity and the debt book for almost four years here, Steve.","Steve Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just maybe last comment on China. What are you guys seeing a little more broadly in terms of demand over there and that trend, given the....","Jeff Immelt","You know, Steve, we are in a little bit of a different sequence because we are more long cycle oriented stuff. So I think the revenue is up 20% plus in the quarter. Orders slightly below that but still pretty strong and healthcare is very strong. There is a conversion between coal and gas in the power sector. There is, aviation remains pretty strong. So we are not on the short cycle side we are more long cycle driven in China. And we still see a decent environment for us.","Keith Sherin","Just to give you some numbers. The revenue was [14], up 24 as Jeff said. If you look at energy, it\u2019s up 34, aviation was up 26 in the quarter, healthcare was up 24%. The orders are a little slower, they are up 6, but there are also some of the backlog is what we have there. So this is a pretty good performance. We expect a very strong performance across the year for China.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Firstly on energy, you know it\u2019s a slightly odd disconnect where your service orders are down and the prices on the equipment are up. I mean is there some risk, I guess do you have sort of a big catch up on service, spares and that\u2019s now sort of run out of steam? Because I guess you know the improving fundamentals behind equipment orders and therefore pricing you think should reflect in service as well?","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t think there is any risk of that. I think what we saw in the business in the quarter from an orders perspective were that the customers are running their gas turbine as a result of low natural gas pricing. If you look at the revenue in energy and services, it was pretty solid in the quarter. So our team has positive outlook as a result of the current operating environment. And for us it\u2019s a question of when does it come through.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thanks. And then on healthcare. I guess that was the business that had pricing down. You know how worried are you about the ability to drive earnings up year-over-year in the second half. I understand that the Latin American mis-execution normalizes but pricing is running at, what minus 1.5.....","Jeff Immelt","You know, Julian, pricing is about -- that\u2019s just kind of the nature of the business. Because it\u2019s a little bit on -- you know you are a little bit on the confusing learning curve. So that\u2019s been kind of nature. The CM rates are still pretty strong and I think that in some ways it\u2019s a little bit of apples and oranges. So I think we see a U.S. healthcare market that\u2019s kind of flat, maybe up a couple of points. As Keith said, Europe is very tough. But the emerging markets in healthcare are pretty dynamic. And I think at EPG we said healthcare is the one plus to two plus, so up single to double. We still think healthcare is going to have a good solid second half of the year.","Keith Sherin","You know the orders, if you look at the book to bill in the quarter, they were 1.11, at the half it\u2019s 1.08. They\u2019ve built a little bit of backlog. They need to execute. That\u2019s what we are looking for in the second half here, Julian.","Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. And then finally the industrial CFOA was down year-over-year in Q2. Was that just around sort of working capital relating to wind orders or....?","Keith Sherin","It\u2019s really two things. We had about $200 million of pensions funding, we haven\u2019t had that before. We expect that to be about $400 for the year. But as you know in the K we put out, it was going to be $1 billion for the year. So 600 better for the year than we said. And then we just built inventory. We have built a billion plus of inventory in the energy business and as you said it\u2019s mostly related to the wind. In the second half here we are going to deliver close to 1800 to 2000 wind units. Almost of the full amount of volume we had for all last year. So we got a good outlook here in the second half in energy and wind is going to be a big part of that.","Jeff Immelt","Let me just go back to what Keith said on pensions just to make sure you guys understand it. So originally I think our funding for this year was going to be a billion....","Keith Sherin","1 billion, yes.","Jeff Immelt","Now it\u2019s $400 million. So its $600 million better. And I think we have put in the K...","Keith Sherin","2.1.","Jeff Immelt","We put 2.1. So now we think that\u2019s going to be....","Keith Sherin","100 million...","Jeff Immelt","Extremely small, may be less than a 100 million. So that\u2019s a big benefit in cash over the next few years that investors should understand.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Feldman with UBS.","Jason Feldman - UBS","So regarding the discontinued operations charges, WMC and GE Money Japan. Are there divested finance assets where there is still recourse or retained liability that have the risk of popping up like this. Are these really the two big ones that are out there?","Keith Sherin","These are the two.","Jason Feldman - UBS","And on wind, obviously it\u2019s challenging today, it\u2019s a cyclical market and the products tax credits are expiring. So how do you feel about that business longer term? Given changing economics of low gas prices and a fairly crowded competitive environment in wind.","Jeff Immelt","You know we said that in the next year we anticipated $0.03 down versus this year in wind. So we are kind of getting ready for that. You know the industry is reforming kind of outside the United States right now. So we have got some big orders in places like Brazil and Canada and Australia, Turkey, places like that. You know we have navigated the cycle as well as anybody. I think we probably make as much money as the rest of the industry combined or something like that. And we have a pretty good window on the future. So we haven\u2019t....","Keith Sherin","Return on capital is almost infinite here.","Jeff Immelt","We haven\u2019t over-invested. We have got a very flexible supply chain. So I think we are just going to kind of ride the wave. But we do think that its $0.03 headwind next year and we are already taking action to kind of be able to offset that.","Jason Feldman - UBS","Okay. And then lastly, you mentioned the potential $5 million of real estate divestiture. There was the EverBank deal a couple of weeks ago. Has the environment for potential asset sales improved materially recently or is this just at the right time and you have had kind of unique opportunity that should be taken advantage of what's out there.","Keith Sherin","Sure, it\u2019s a steady improvement. You have seen us talk about the valuation changes in real estate, quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter. And this is another sign that the market is getting better. I mean we are able to move $5 billion of real estate assets at a gain to the company in total. And the team is going to continue to work on that. So I think, yes, valuations have continued to improve. Liquidity is coming in the marketplace. If you got a good property with a decent lease, you can extract a good price in this low interest rate environment. Stabilization of valuations in Europe, the valuation in Europe was better than we anticipated as we closed the first quarter. And we expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Had a question on the different margins factors in the back half of the year, year-over-year versus with the one half. We are looking at volume leverage, better price flowing through and the anniversary of the acquisitions. Can you kind of gauge what are the relative imports there?","Keith Sherin","Sure. I think, Jeff said that value gap is going to be positive. That\u2019s the difference between the pricing we are getting in the raw material inflation that we experience, or deflation. That is positive 100 in the second quarter. We expect that to continue. R&D as a percent of revenue, we have talked about that a lot, we have peaked as a percent of revenue. We are still at a very high level in terms of revenue but it\u2019s peaked in terms of the impact on margin. Our total cost productivity which is our ability to continue to deliver new volume and take advantage of leverage, it was positive four tenths of a point in the second quarter. We expect that to continue. And the one dynamic that we are working our way through is the equipment and service margin mix. But as Jeff said, we expect margins to go positive in the third quarter. And they will be positive in the fourth quarter and to get to the 30 basis points we need an average of about 80 basis points in the second half. And that\u2019s what our teams are working on right now.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Okay. And then on the turbine Flex launch in the second half. How are you viewing that now? And is that impacting current demand and how do you view the lag to regaining some share and competitive parity?","Jeff Immelt","You know, Chris, I think the Flex launch is going well. We have had some great wins in Japan in the second quarter that were fantastic. And I still think our gas turbine share is going to be somewhere between 40% and 45%. So we want to retain kind of historical averages for that and we will continue to invest in new NPI in the gas turbine product line as well. So again, I think this is really important for us and Flex has gone well. And I think you will continue to see strong NPI efforts from GE.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeffery Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research","I guess I really don\u2019t understand your pensions strategy. I mean I understand the obligation has gone down under this law change. But your annual benefits payable like $3 billion a year. Other companies have kind of remarked, yeah, there is a lot of change but we don\u2019t want to let ourselves get further behind. Just kind of surprised with the posture you are taking there and how do you see pensions playing out as you look further beyond 2013?","Keith Sherin","Well, we have taken a lot of actions here. I think the most important action that we took was we closed the plant to new employees, Jeff. Now you may not be aware of that but as a result of that action the change in the future liability has dramatically -- the curve has dramatically changed. And it\u2019s a huge amount of pressure we have taken of that pension plan in terms of the earnings rate that has to be realized over time. I think the benefit payments are less than what you talked about. I don\u2019t have the exact number but it\u2019s not the size what you said. And our team is working on a risk reduction strategy. You know we are not going to full risk-reduction in terms of going 100% to risk off in bonds. But we are reducing our risk seeking exposures as we become additionally more funded from a [risk] gap perspective.","So the team has got a good asset allocation plan. They have got a good track record on the turns. We have cut the future tail of this liability by closing the plant to new employees. And we were going to fund a billion this year, we are going to fund 2 billion next year. We know, our anticipation is we will be fully funded in a couple of years. This change in ERISA funding doesn\u2019t really change our outlook much on what we think we are going to do in terms of how we get to fully funded in that pension plan. And we are not seeking additional risk to do it.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research","","And I was just looking at the Annual Report that shows $3 billion in 2012, and actually shows it\u2019s going up in the next four or five years, not down.","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t think that\u2019s $3 billion. That includes all the healthcare costs, that includes the retiree and employee healthcare costs. It\u2019s about a billion dollars on pension, Jeff.","Jeffery Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. It says principal plan. Just on GECAS, obviously kind of all the NEOs and everything was so new last year that there was no impact. Obviously, you are going to roll up your sleeves in Q3, I mean you obviously gave us a heads up to be on alert through this. Is there some early thoughts on what we should expect.","Keith Sherin","I don\u2019t have any signals from the team of anything unusual. We continue to reduce our exposure to older assets as you know and we have taken some impairments quarter-by-quarter-by-quarter on some of the older assets that are less fuel efficient. You know our fleet is in pretty good shape in terms of the percent of older assets. And I don\u2019t anticipate anything abnormal here in the third quarter, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from (inaudible) with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Just wanted to turn your attention to energy margins in 2013. I think everyone knows that wind will take a step down in 2013. How confident are you that you can margin or you can even grow margin with let's say $2 billion less volume.","Keith Sherin","Well, just on a wind basis alone if you move to right business at the margin, you are going to have a margin increase.","Jeff Immelt","That\u2019s cheating. That\u2019s....","Keith Sherin","Well, that\u2019s reality. I mean we\u2019re getting penalized for this year Jeff.","Jeff Immelt","Well, let's step through it. Let's (inaudible). Value gap positive, so you are going to have pricing ahead of deflation. We see pretty good headwind on that. I think we are going to have a good services mix next year. I think we like the way services could line up for next year. Structural cost down. You know again you are talking about, you know guys I would reiterate, we have said we are going to take $2 billion of cost out of \u201912, 13, and \u201914. And we are on our way to doing that. And that\u2019s going to take G&A as a percentage of revenue, it\u2019s going to go down a couple of 100 basis points around this place. So you are going to get some structural cost out. So you are going to have good value gap, you are going to have positive mix, you are going to have pretty good service and you are going to have structural cost down. You know I think that is a pretty good line up.","Unidentified Analyst","Right. But looking at wind in itself. I know it\u2019s a highly variable cost business. If we get on from say seven to say five, what happens to wind margins next year?","Jeff Immelt","I would bet that wind, just intra-wind, right. [Niger] that\u2019s what you are asking?","Unidentified Analyst","Exactly.","Jeff Immelt","Yeah. Wind margins will probably go down a little bit. But it\u2019s really de-verticalized business, and so I think it\u2019s not going to be kind of what you think. But just because of the volume we have this year, my hunch is that the margin rate, just intra-wind, will probably go down slightly.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then moving to the broader energy business, the move to the positive pricing orders is great news. Can you just remind us what is the lead time on pricing in the order book. When do we see that coming through the P&L?","Jeff Immelt","12 to 18 months.","Keith Sherin","12 to 18 months, yeah. By product line.","Unidentified Analyst","And then stripping out energy management, that\u2019s $6 billion BU. I think it will be a small segment by far. Is the intention to grow that, if we are thinking about this sort of acquisition funding going forward? You know should we view energy management as up there, top one or top two?","Jeff Immelt","You know I think there is segments within energy management [Nigel] that we like, that we might do some of the smaller acquisitions in. I think the key thing is again to give investors kind of pure play on the power generation side, a pure play on the oil and gas side and a pure play on the energy management side. And I think that\u2019s what many people have been asking for and that\u2019s what you are going to get in the structure.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then finally, I don\u2019t want to get too deep into the weeds of corporate expenses. But it\u2019s a tough line to model and it seems to be running above the $3 billion expansion guidance for fiscal \u201912. Are we still running towards that, Keith, or should we expect that to come down in the second half of the year.","Keith Sherin","Say that again?","Jeff Immelt","The $3 billion in corporate. While we are still running through the...","Keith Sherin","Yeah $3 billion corporate for the year, yes. We are about $1.5 at the half and there is some ups and downs on the one timers. But that\u2019s the estimate for the year. Yeah.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks.","Keith Sherin","I just want to -- the pension out of the (inaudible) is about $3 billion. I am sorry, Jeff is right. Sorry about that.","Operator","Our final question comes from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","I just had a follow up. So on the energy services decline in orders, what you are saying is they are running their plants so you are not seeing kind of the normal kind of pace of orders. I guess that would suggest that I mean at some time they have got to service these things and if they are running in for a longer hour. So is that actually a push out business?","Jeff Immelt","Yeah, I think, Steve, like the flow orders that would tend to happen and shut downs and stuff like that are slower because the guys are running the plant. So I think...","Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan","But that\u2019s got to come at some point all right?","Jeff Immelt","You know again, with cheap gas prices everything we thought about this is true. Guys are running the plants hard. And they are pushing out service and stuff like that and I think that will come back at some point.","Operator","No further questions. At this, Mr. Schauenberg, do you have any additional remarks?","Trevor Schauenberg","Yes, thank you everyone. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We are distributing our quarterly supplemental data schedule for GE Capital as we always do today. Just a couple of few announcements here regarding investor events.

[Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the program over to your host for today\u2019s conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew Cribbins","Great, thank you. Good morning, and welcome everyone. We are pleased to host today\u2019s fourth quarter webcast. Regarding the materials for this webcast, we issued the press release, presentation and GE Supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward-looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change as the world changes. Please interpret them in that light.","For today\u2019s webcast, we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; our Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff Bornstein.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeff Immelt","Hey thanks, Matt. Good morning everybody. Look, we still see the global environment as generally positive with a lot of volatility. ","GE had a strong fourth quarter with some elements better than we indicated in December. Operating EPS was $0.56, up 6%, led by industrial EPS which grew by 23%. Orders grew by 3%, which was 5% organically and our backlog expanded to a new record. ","Industrial organic growth was up 9% and margins expanded by 50 basis points. Our initiatives continued to deliver results. Industrial CFOA was $7.2 billion, up 64% reported in the quarter or 30% ex the 2013 NBCU taxes. ","Capital\u2019s quarter was consistent with our expectations. The US continued to strengthen as in Asia. Some businesses are seeing more momentum like aviation, healthcare. Our oil and gas team executed well despite volatility. Their underlying performance was revenue flat and earnings up 6%. And we believe that our diverse and integrated model worked for investors in the quarter as it will in 2015. ","We delivered on our key commitments for the year. Industrial segment profits grew by 10%, driven by 7% organic growth and 50 basis points of margin expansion. GE Capital reduced ENI by $17 billion in the hit to earnings plan. CFOA was in the middle of the range at $15.2 billion. Free cash flow was $11.2 billion, up 6% for the year. ","Our capital allocation choices were in line with expectations. On the M&A front, Alstom should be a financial and strategic driver. Appliances were well priced and done a good point of cycle, and the Synchrony spin will result in a substantial reduction in GE shares. ","We are executing a valuable pivot at GE, one that improves our business mix while delivering EPS growth and expanding returns. ","Now for orders, total orders grew by 3%, which is pretty good in the environment. As I said, organically this is 5% in total with 3% in equipment and 8% growth in services. Orders grew by 7% for the year. We had strengthened services which was up 6% in the quarter and 10% for the year, and we grew backlog by $17 billion year-over-year. ","Power and water had a solid quarter but comps were impacted by the huge Algerian deal in 2013. Without that, orders were up 13% in the quarter and we now have 15 H orders with another 30 technical selections. Oil and gas orders were down 4% organically, consistent with our expectations. Turbo machinery actually saw orders grow by 16% in the quarter. Aviation orders grew by 15% and they end the year with a record backlog. Aviation commercial spares grew by 37% in the quarter. ","Importantly, the US healthcare equipment orders grew by 17%, demonstrating renewed strength in our biggest market. Our success with the tier 4 locomotive continues. We took 1355 orders in 2014 and are positioned for record shipments in 2015. ","The US was strong with orders growing by 18% in the fourth quarter, following a 25% growth in the third quarter. And growth markets were mixed. For instance, Middle East, North Africa was negative in the quarter due to the Algerian order I talked about earlier but was up 20% for the year. And Asian growth market orders grew by 21%. ","We closed 2014 with a backlog of $261 billion and in December we called out a 2015 organic growth range of 2% to 5% and we still feel good about this range. For execution, our team really executed well in the quarter with organic growth up 9% and margins up 50 basis points. ","For the year, industrial segment profit was up 10% with 7% organic revenue growth and 50 basis points of margin enhancement. Our initiatives are driving growth ahead of our peers. Our product lineup is quite strong. The H turbine is winning in the market. Our aviation wins are huge with 79% LEAP share to date. The tier 4 continues to win. Our healthcare products are gaining share in CT, MR and ultrasound. ","Aviation commercial spare shipments grew by 24% and power gen services grew revenue by 14%. As I said earlier, growth market revenues expanded by 7% in \u201814 with five of nine regions growing. ","Also to update on a few of our adjacencies. Life sciences grew earnings by 15% for the year. Water hit a 10% operating profit rate in the quarter with 26% earnings growth for the year. And we won the Boeing 777X on-board computing system. This is a huge win and positions GE as a tier 1 avionics supplier. ","Margins continue to be good story, up 50 basis points for the year. Simplification and services again are the big drivers. We hit 14% of structural cost as a percentage of sales for the year with another $1.2 billion of costs out. And corporate costs ex gains\/restructuring and NBCU declined by more than $900 million. ","We\u2019re seeing the impact of analytics on service productivity. Service margins grew by 270 basis points in the quarter and we have momentum in every business, and with an intensifying focus on gross margins and product costs, we are on track for another year of margin growth in 2015. ","Now on the cash for the quarter. our industrial cash grew by 64% to $7.2 billion. This is consistent with our expectations for the quarter and the year. We finished the year by shipping a tremendous amount of volume and our teams did a great job on working capital which reduced by $2 billion in the fourth quarter. ","Free cash flow for the year was $11.2 billion, up 6%, and the GE Capital dividend was $3 billion, below the $6 billion they delivered in 2013. We ended the year with substantial liquidity and financial strength. GE Capital ended the year with tier 1 common ratio of 12.7%, substantially above the regulatory guidelines. ","We returned about $11 billion to investors in dividends and buyback and we remain on track for $12 billion to $15 billion of free cash flow and dispositions in 2015. We will allocate our capital in line with the discussion we had in December. Our priority is to execute on Alstom, fund organic growth and continue to grow the dividend. ","Remember that Synchrony at the current pricing should return $18 billion to $20 billion to investors in the share exchange. In any environment where we have an uncertain macroeconomy, it's important to talk about execution. ","In 2014, in our performance, you can see the tangible results of how we are running GE. Our underlying business has significant operational momentum, supported by the changes to how we are running GE day-to-day, with more transparency and more accountability. ","This was an excellent execution quarter for the team and now Jeff will give you the business details. ","Jeff Bornstein","Thanks Jeff. I will start with the fourth quarter summary. We had revenues of $42 billion, up 4% a quarter. Industrial sales of $31 billion were up 8%. And GE Capital revenues of $11.5 billion were up 4%. Operating earnings of $5.6 billion were higher by 4%. ","Operating earnings-per-share of $0.56 were up 6% with industrial EPS up 23% and GE Capital EPS down 17%. Continuing EPS of $0.52 includes the impact of non-operating pension. The net EPS includes the impact of discontinued operations. We had $0.01 impact in discontinued operations this quarter associated with WMC. This was driven by reserve increase of $142 million to reflect WMC\u2019s current assessment of its loan-loss exposure based on recent settlement activity and negotiation. ","WMC ended the quarter with $809 million of reserves, flat with fourth quarter of \u201913. As Jeff said, CFOA for the year was $15.2 billion. We had industrial CFOA of $12.2 billion and received $3 billion of dividends from GE Capital. ","In the quarter, industrial generated $7.2 billion of CFOA, up 64% on a reported basis and up 30%, excluding the impact of NBCU taxes from last year. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 13%, bringing the year-to-date rate to 17%. In the quarter we benefited from the passage of the extenders bill and deductions from higher restructuring and impairments. The GE Capital tax rate was 5% for the quarter and 2% for the year, consistent with the low single digits estimate that we previously communicated. ","On the right side, you can see the segment results. Industrial segment revenues were up 6% reported and up 9% organically, reflecting about two points of headwind from foreign exchange and one point from acquisitions and dispositions. Foreign exchange was approximately $600 million drag on industrial segment revenue and about a $180 million impact on op profit for the quarter. ","Despite this headwind, industrial segment operating profit was up 9%. GE Capital earnings were down 19%, primarily driven by lower gains and tax benefits associated with the Swiss and BAY transactions in the fourth quarter of last year. I will cover the dynamics of each of the business segments in a couple of pages. ","First, I will start with the other items page for the quarter. We have $0.04 of restructuring and other charges at corporate, over $0.02 of that related to ongoing industrial restructuring and other items as we continue to take actions to improve the industrial cost structure. At $353 million pretax, this was approximately $75 million higher than the planned and reflects the acceleration of some restructuring opportunities from 2015. ","We also had a $217 million pretax charge for an impairment related to strategic investment in the energy space. This investment has underperformed in the market but we continue to expect that to be long-term value in the asset. ","In November of 2013, I reviewed with investors our plan to invest $1 billion to $1.5 billion in restructuring to accelerate the repositioning of our industrial cost footprint and position us to grow earnings through the pivot in 2015 and \u201916. ","On the bottom of the page is the profile of those restructuring and other charges that we took in 2014 by quarter and the $0.01 gain associated with the Wayne disposition. For the total year, net charges were $0.11 per share or $1.7 billion pretax. ","I\u2019ll give you an update on industrial cost dynamics. On SG&A, we've made a lot of progress. We ended the year with 14% SG&A to sales which is down almost 2 points from 2013. This was driven by a combination of cost-out efforts in the industrial segments and corporate. For the year we took out $1.2 billion of structural costs, in line with the $1 billion plus we\u2019ve been communicating with you. ","On the bottom left, you can see industrial segment gross margins, excluding corporate. For the year, segment gross margins were down 80 basis points, which is driven entirely by negative mix as we grew equipment revenues faster than services, particularly in wind, GEnx and thermal. ","As we discussed at the December outlook meeting, Dan Heintzelman, Jamie Miller and I are driving a focused initiative to improve industrial gross margins to an intense focus on product cost. Similar to our programmatic approach around SG&A, we are targeting to improve gross margins by 50 basis points in 2015. ","On the right side, you can see the corporate operating costs. The bar graph excludes gains, restructuring and NBCU operations from 2013, so you can see our true operating expenses. We\u2019ve taken significant actions on corporate costs with about $950 million reduction for the year. This includes functional headquarter cost improvements, lower global and growth spend, operating pension and retiree health cost improvements and non-repeating charges in 2013, principally the EBX charge we took in the second quarter of 2013. ","The focus on reducing corporate costs will continue into 2015 and we expect corporate costs to be about $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion for the year. We will continue to reduce corporate costs but this will be partly offset by higher pension expenses as Jeff outlined during the outlook meeting in December. ","Now going to the segments and start with power and water. Orders in the fourth quarter totaled $9.5 billion, down 8%. Orders were higher by 13%, excluding the Algerian mega deal in the fourth quarter of last year. Equipment orders were down 12%, driven by thermal down 62% as a result of a difficult comparison to last year's 270% increase, including Algeria. ","We had orders for 41 gas turbines in the quarter, flat with last year excluding the Algerian deal. In the fourth quarter, we received an order for 2 H turbines bringing units and backlog to 15 Hs and we\u2019ve been selected for another 30 units on projects and are bidding in additional 61 units as we speak. ","Total gas turbine order count for the year finished at 105 units, representing 18 GW of power. Partially offsetting thermal\u2019s orders decline was [indiscernible] which was higher by 66% and renewables was up 47% in the quarter. Distributed power equipment growth was driven by turbines, up over a 100%, partly offset by a decline in engines. The turbine strength was attributed to a large win in Egypt consisting of 20 trailer-mounted units, 14 LM6000s and some balance of plant. The 20TMs and six of the 14 LMs converted to sales in the quarter. ","For the year, DP recorded orders for 167 turbines versus 174 in 2013. Renewables equipment orders were up 47%, reflecting orders for 1251 turbines. The US was up 16%, including a 138 safe harbor units associated with the PTC extension. And we saw a significant growth in Latin America, the Middle East and in regions we took no orders in the fourth quarter of \u201913, including China and India. ","Service orders were down 2%, also driven by no repeat of the Algerian deal. Excluding Algeria, service orders grew 9% on strong transactional upgrades and outages. AGPs in the quarter were 26 versus 25 last year, bringing the total year AGP count to 80. ","Power and water revenues of $9.4 billion in the quarter were up 22% with very strong equipment revenues up 37% and service revenues up 7%. Equipment revenue was driven by strength in thermal, up 64% with sales of 44 gas turbines versus 28 last year and renewables up 20% on 206 more wind turbines and DP up 33% in the quarter. ","Operating profit in the quarter totaled $2.1 billion, up 13% versus fourth quarter of \u201913 and earnings were driven by higher volume and cost productivity, partially offset by negative value gap, principally price and unfavorable mix of higher equipment sales versus services. SG&A in the quarter was down 12% year-over-year and margins in the quarter were down 190 basis points. ","As you look into 2015, we expect to continue to grow services, including upgrades and we anticipate a flat gas turbine market but expect to gain share. We are planning for wind to deliver 3000 to 3200 units and distributed power will continue to be pressured as we look into \u201915.","Next, oil and gas. Oil and gas orders at $4.9 billion were down 10% in the fourth quarter. Excluding the effects of FX and the Wayne disposition, orders were down 4%. Notwithstanding the volatility of oil prices in the fourth quarter, we believe the relative impact was modest with more impact expected in 2015. ","Equipment orders of $2.5 billion were down 15% reported, down 9% organically. The subsea orders were down 38% with no repeat of large fourth quarter of last year orders with Petrobras and ENI. Downstream technology orders were down 46% driven by a large Shell order in the fourth quarter of last year in our distributed gas solutions business, partially offset by strong growth of 7% in the downstream products platform. ","Measurement and control equipment orders were up 6% organically as we continue to see improvement in end flow and process markets. Drilling and surface orders were down 2% with drilling down 72% as expected, partly offset by 7% growth in our surface business. ","Turbo machinery was up 60% on natural gas orders in North America, the Middle East and in Russia. Service orders were down 4% but up 1% organically. The TMS orders were down 10% on lower installations in the quarter, partly offset by 6% organic growth in M&C, downstream technology growth of 16% and drilling and surface higher by 11%. ","For the year, total orders were flat with backlog up 1%. Oil and gas revenues in the quarter of $5 billion were down 6% reported and flat organically, driven by three points of FX and three points of disposition impact. Equipment revenues were down 5%, with subsea down 10% but flat excluding exchange. M&C was higher by 3% organically and downstream technology and drilling and surface were up 10% and 11% respectively. Service revenues were down 6% primarily driven by TMS, down 11% and M&C down 5% but M&C was up 12% organically. ","Operating profit in the quarter was higher by 1% versus the fourth quarter of last year and up 6% organically driven by strong value gap and cost productivity offset by the effects of foreign exchange. Margins expanded 110 basis points in the quarter and 100 basis points for the year. ","As we outlined in December outlook meeting, 2015 will be a challenging year for our oil and gas business. [indiscernible] and the team are focused on executing on the cost-out actions to offset volatility and deliver on their commitments. ","Next up is aviation. Aviation demand continues be strong with revenue passenger kilometers November year-to-date up 6.1% on international routes and up 5.3% on domestic routes. Freight growth was 4.4% November year-to-date. Orders for aviation were strong, up 15% in the quarter. Equipment orders of $4.4 billion were higher by 8% and service orders grew 25%. ","Equipment orders were principally driven by commercial engines. GEnx orders of $1.2 billion were up 23% on large orders from American and Air France. GE90 orders were up 2.5 times to $900 million in the quarter and LEAP and CFM recorded $1.2 billion of orders. ","Our total win rate for the LEAP since launch is now at 79% on narrow-body aircraft. Military equipment orders were down 59% driven by the slow military environment. Service orders up 25% were driven by strong commercial space orders, at $35.6 million a day, up 37% and stronger military spares. ","Orders for total year 2014 grew 8% and backlog grew 7% for the year to $134 billion. Revenues in the fourth quarter were higher by 4% to $6.4 billion driven by commercial equipment revenues up 8%, services up 3% and military equipment down 3%. ","Commercial spares were strong up 24%. We shipped 77 GEnx units in the quarter and 287 for the year. Leverage and operating profit were strong with 12% growth in volume and positive value gap, partly offset by mix and higher R&D. Op margins improve 140 basis points in the quarter. Overall the aviation team had a strong quarter and a year and we expect strong performance to continue into 2015. ","Next is healthcare. Healthcare had a better quarter than the headline results would suggest. Orders were up 1% in the quarter but up 4% excluding foreign exchange. And the US was quite strong, up 9%. Latin America and China were both up 2%, offset by Europe down 1% but up 5% organically. Japan was down 23% driven by the consumption tax and reimbursement reform and the Middle East was down 26%, mostly driven by Saudi. ","Healthcare system orders were down 3% but up 2% organically, driven by US imaging and ultrasound equipment orders which were up 12% in the quarter. We saw growth across most modalities with particular strength in CT, up 22% from our new revolution CT introduction and ultrasound up 15% from a new [indiscernible] on product in the women\u2019s health diagnostic space. This was offset by softer orders in Japan, Russia and the Middle East. ","China orders were up 2% reflecting delays in government tenders we've seen over the last several quarters. Life science orders up 13%, driven by a bioprocess of 60% on very strong demand in the US and Europe, offset partially by core imaging, down 7%. ","Revenues of $5.1 billion were flat but higher by 3% ex foreign exchange and HCS revenues were down 3% but up 2% organically and life science revenues were up 9% and up 6% organically. Operating profit was down 4% but was up 1% organically. The strong cost execution, including 5% lower SG&A, was more than offset by price and foreign exchange. Looking forward we expect the US market to continue to improve. Although final industry figures have yet to be published we believe we are winning share in key modalities. And China should grow modestly as we look into 2015. The business will continue to drive structural product costs out as we move forward. ","Next, transportation which had a strong orders quarter up 62% with equipment orders up 107% and services higher by 19%. In 2014 transportation had its strongest orders year ever at $9.6 billion, up 89%. Locomotive orders in the quarter were 284 units versus 70 last year driven by North America where we took orders for 235 additional tier 4 compliant units. ","For the total year 2014 we received orders for 1355 tier 4 compliant locomotives. Backlog for the year grew 43% to $21 billion with equipment higher by 148% and services higher by 22%. Carloads grew strongly in North America, up 4.4% in 2014 led by intermodal up 5.4%. Commodities, including agriculture, were up 3.7% and petroleum was up 12.5% for the year. ","In the fourth quarter, petroleum volumes continued to grow, up 16% year-over-year. Revenues in the quarter were up 8%, driven by locomotives up 8%, services up 14% partly offset by mining, down by 31%. For the total year, revenue was down 4% largely driven by mining. ","Operating profit in the quarter was up 13% on higher locomotive volume, material deflation and cost productivity, partly offset by lower mining volume. The transportation team has executed well and has positioned the business to capitalize on the new tier 4 requirements in 2015. ","Next, energy management which earned more in the fourth quarter than they earned in the entirety of 2013. Orders in the quarter were down 2% largely driven by softer marine orders and power conversion which was down about 16%, partially offset by digital energy up strongly at 17% and industrial solutions up 5%. Backlog grew 9% to $5 billion. ","Revenues were down 2% but up 2% organically. Power conversion revenues grew 6%, digital energy grew 1%. Industrial solutions was down 6%. Operating profit of $113 million was higher by 2.5 times on strong value gap and cost execution. For the year we earned $246 million of operating profit, up 124%. ","Execution continues to improve and we expect substantial improvements again in 2015. In appliances and lighting, revenue in the quarter was up 5%. Appliance revenues were up 8% driven by strong volume. And industry core units were up 8% with both retail and the contract markets up 8% as well. ","Lighting revenues were down 1% on lower traditional product demand which was down 15% and more than offset the strong LED lighting growth of 72% in the quarter. LED now makes up 27% of lighting revenues up from 16% in the fourth quarter of last year. Operating profit of $180 million was up 32% in the quarter and margins expanded by 160 basis points. ","Next, I will cover our GE Capital. GE Capital\u2019s revenue of $1.5 billion was up 4% primarily from lower marks and impairments. Net income of $1.9 billion was down 19% principally driven by lower gains and tax benefits, including those related to last year\u2019s portfolio exits including the Swiss and BAY Bank transactions, partially offset by lower credit cost, marks and impairments. ","ENI excluding liquidity of $353 billion was down $17 million, 5% from last year and down $2 billion sequentially Nonstrategic ENI was down 12 billion to 132 billion or 8% versus last year. Net interest margin in the quarter at 5% was essentially flat. GE Capital\u2019s tier 1 common ratio on a BASEL 1 basis remains in a strong position and ended the year with 12.7%. This is up approximately 60 basis points from the third quarter and 150 basis points year-over-year. ","Our liquidity levels are strong ending the quarter at $76 billion. This includes $13 billion attributable to Synchrony. Our commercial paper program remains stable at $25 billion and we had $10 billion of long-term debt issuance for the year. ","Excluding the activity related to Synchrony, in 2015 we have already used for 7 billion of long-term debt as part of our total year plan of around 20 billion. Right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable with significant improvements in our mortgage portfolio driven primarily by the \u2013 half a billion dollar non-performing loan portfolio in our UK home lending business. ","We generated a small gain during the quarter and the move of our Hungarian bank to held for sale. We expect to complete the exit of the Hungarian during the first half of 2015. ","In terms of segment performance, commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with a $172 billion of assets, down 1% to last year, largely driven by foreign exchange. Global on-book volume was $12 billion, down 10%. However we continue to see strengthening in the US largely in equipment financing with volume up 4%. ","New business returns in both lending and equipment were largely in line with the first three quarters of the year. Earnings of $549 million were up 109% driven by lower marks and impairments. In 2014, the CLL business earned $2.3 billion, up 16%. ","The consumer segment ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 3% from last year with earnings of $1.1 billion down 45%. Our share of Synchrony earnings was $451 million, down 3% driven by minority interest and partially offset by core growth. Consistent with last quarter as a now publicly traded company, CEO Margaret Keane and the team will host their own investor call later this morning. ","Separation efforts remain on track. Excluding Synchrony, assets were down 17% as we continue to reduce our presence in nonstrategic portfolios. Earnings excluding, Synchrony, were $686 million, down 57% driven by the non-repeat of gains in and benefits recorded last year for the Swiss and Bay transactions, partially offset by $594 million gain associated with the sale of the Nordics consumer platform. ","Just as a reminder, as a result of the accounting guidelines, roughly half that gain was recognized in prior quarters as tax benefits and GE Capital corporate, these benefits were reversed in the fourth quarter and again was taken in the consumer segment resulting in a net gain in GE Capital of $300 million in the fourth quarter. ","In 2014 the consumer segment earned $3 billion, down 30%. In real estate assets of $34 billion were down 11% versus prior year. The equity book is down 35% from a year ago to $9 billion. Net income of $299 million was up 134% driven by higher gains and portfolio earnings partially offset by higher impairments. In the current quarter, we sold 350 properties from our real estate equity book with a book value of about $2.1 billion for a $328 million gain. In 2014, the real estate business earned $1 billion, down 42% on lower gains. ","In the verticals, GECAS earned $218 million, up 207% driven by lower impairments partially offset by lower gains and lower assets. Overall the portfolio is in great shape and we finished the quarter with zero delinquencies and three aircraft on the ground. ","New volume remained strong at $2 billion, up 50% with attractive returns in line with the first three quarters of the year. For the year, GECAS earned $1 billion, was up 17% from prior year. The Milestone acquisition continues to progress and we expect to close during the first quarter of 2015 pending regulatory approvals. ","Energy finance earned $111 million, down 5% in the quarter in line with lower assets. EFS\u2019 volume was up 31% year-over-year at a very attractive return. In 2014 EFS business earned $401 million, down 2%. Overall Keith and the team continued to execute the portfolio strategy and delivered solid operating results. As we look forward to 2015 we expect GE Capital would generate about $0.60 on an EPS basis as Jeff discussed last month during the annual outlook meeting. We expect GE Capital to earn approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter of the year. ","Lastly, I wanted to spend a minute and talk about the framework for 2015 and cover four points. On the left you have our segment outlook as Jeff shared in December. Overall there is no change to that framework. ","On the right side, first positively we're seeing strength in the US healthcare market. Orders were strong, up 9% and equipment orders were up 17% with particular strength in imaging and ultrasound. Orders have been on a positive trend in the US since the first quarter of 2014 and after the final fourth quarter results we're more encouraged that this trend will continue into 2015. ","Second is aviation which we feel is stronger. Spares orders grew 25% in 2014 and we are targeting high single-digit growth in 2015. Revenue passenger kilometers and freight miles continue to be strong and low Jet A should be a meaningful positive for our customers in this space. ","When you think about currency, we plan 2015 assuming a stronger dollar but we\u2019ve seen some continued strengthening since the December meeting. Assuming the euro at today's rates for the entire year, foreign exchange would have a modest impact, about a penny a share, so very manageable in the context of the total company. ","In December, we also outlined our expectations for oil and gas with the backdrop of oil at $60 to 65 a barrel. Since then prices have fallen further. When we planned the year we relied on multiple scenarios, including a further fall in oil prices. Lorenzo and the team are laser focused on executing against their backlog and their costs. The team is reducing employment, executing restructuring and simplification projects to materially reduce their cost structure, all predicated on a tougher scenario. ","Additionally across the company we expect to realize some incremental benefits in direct material and other logistical and variable costs as a result of lower fuel costs. Oil and gas represented about 15% of our industrial segment earnings in 2014. We believe that within the context of the company portfolio the potentially tougher oil and gas scenario is manageable and consistent within our framework. ","With that, I would like to pass it back over to Jeff. ","Jeff Immelt","Thanks, Jeff. We remain comfortable with our framework for 2015. We expect the industrial EPS of between $1.10 and $1.20 behind solid organic growth and margin expansion. Corporate costs will be substantially lower. Remember we funded $0.11 of uncovered restructuring in 2014. In 2015 we will offset restructuring with gains. ","In addition, we should have the impact from six months of Alstom. Capital results are on track with Synchrony timing the main variable. Free cash flow and dispositions are on track for the $12 billion to $15 billion we spoke about in the year. And again cash return to investors depends on Synchrony timing but it would be substantial if we do the split this year. ","So closing the year and since the outlook meeting, the GE world remains balanced. There are always puts and takes in the global economy. For instance, the US is quite strong which has a positive impact in businesses like healthcare and aviation and the price of oil has declined even further since December. Our job is to manage the company through volatility and while we see the potential for risk to oil and gas based on current oil prices, we are aggressively working offsets through cost actions and positive opportunities elsewhere in GE. ","We are also seeing stronger momentum in several other businesses. In total this demonstrates the strength of our portfolio approach. Looking back in 2014, out of eight industrial businesses, three beat their plan, three met their plan and two missed their plan. But together we did what we set out to do growing core earnings by 10%. ","In addition, let me give you more insight to the plan I gave you in December. We have an internal plan that is above the midpoint of the range I gave you. The business results that delivered that plan are embedded in our team\u2019s new incentive compensation for the year. In other words, our leaders achieved their IC when we hit an EPS that is above the midpoint of this range. Now I want you to have transparency on how we think about the world and manage our team. Our targets encompass a thoughtful approach to the environment in a broad range of macro dynamics. ","So let me reiterate. We feel comfortable with our framework. 2015 is an important year for the company and we plan to deliver for you. And now Matt, back to you and let\u2019s take some questions.","Matthew Cribbins","All right. Thanks, Jeff. We will take your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays. ","Scott Davis ","Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for the color. This is a better presentation than we've seen in a while, so thanks for that. I know this is going to be really tough to answer, but it's going to be really important for us to try to ring-fence the oil and gas profit downside. Is there some sort of scenario analysis you could share with us or at least a sensitivity that -- hey, if we are off 35% on upstream, what kind of profit drop you'll see on that?","Jeff Bornstein","This is Jeff. Scott, the way we thought about it particularly when we went through it in December with you is we evaluated multiple scenarios, including a general expectation at that point that we\u2019d be down 0 to 5% but we evaluated scenarios that we\u2019re down beyond that, on lower oil prices. And when we talked about the range with you, of the $70, $80, in total dollar -- 20 industrially we included in that our view of what those downside scenarios are. So I think you got to step back and look at it \u2013 oil and gas is 15% of our segment earnings in industrial being down beyond 5% I think is manageable within the context of the industrial portfolio. And I think importantly Lorenzo and the team are like laser focused on driving the cost and the productivity in their business and the programs they launched were the programs needed to support a lower downside scenario than what we even talked about in December. ","So I think we feel reasonably comfortable -- as comfortable as you can be that within the context of what we've shared with you that we can manage it inside the portfolio, our industrial portfolio. ","Jeff Immelt","I think Scott, I would add to what Jeff said, just to say, I think any time in our world we have multiple hedges and we have the hedge inside the oil and gas business driven by the cost action they are taking, we have other upside of what lower oil prices mean inside the company. And there is businesses inside the company that are doing better as we close the year. And so I really -- I think we've envisioned different scenarios for oil and gas and we still feel quite comfortable on the way \u2013 the way we described the company in December.","Scott Davis ","Because there wasn't anything additional, I don't think, that was said on the call on Alstom, and there was a bit of a price adjustment we saw in the quarter; I think it was something like $700 million or something. Can you give us a sense -- and I know you are probably five months away from close here. But can you give us at least some sense of your confidence in the asset? And given the new world, that the offsets -- I mean, we've got a better euro environment for Alstom; but on the other hand you've got some North Sea oil headwind. So can you give just a better sense of your confidence of the puts and takes of that transaction, and maybe a little color around the $700 million adjustment?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, why don\u2019t I start with the adjustment and then Jeff can give you some color on the company. So effectively what we -- there were several points within the contract that we are open to negotiate post the signing. We made a couple of adjustments, it's about \u20ac250 more that we will pay at closing. Part of that was a payment we\u2019re making at our request. We wanted to strike the legal entities -- we want to restructure it and buy into, we wanted to change a bit for our benefit long-term in terms of taxes and otherwise. And so part of that \u20ac250 million was a payment to ask them to close differently from a legal entity perspective than what was originally contemplated. ","The second was we originally agreed to about a five year use of the Alstom brand, we extended that in this agreement to 25 years, that was about $85 million associated with that, and there were other very small items. I think you will hear Alstom talk about \u20ac400 million, they are counting about a $100 million of interest that they contemplated owing us on cash that they used over the course of the year. We never modeled that, we never counted that. So we see it is about a $250 million euro adjustment to the purchase price but we get a lot of long-term value as a result of that legal entity restructure. ","Jeff Immelt","So I would say Scott, there are always puts and takes, their grid business is reasonably strong, I\u2019d say the renewables business is consistent with -- and also reasonably strong, I'd say the power business is in a flat market kind of the same market we see. Clearly the euro devaluation helps the purchase price and other than that the puts and takes are pretty consistent with how we kind of underwrote the business going in. So their year-end is in March and we don't expect -- we don't really have a change in closing date. We still expect -- we still for the purpose of the plan, plan on July first for everything more or less. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe ","So, Jeff, you talked about a pretty limited impact from the dollar on your plan. But I'm just wondering maybe if you could just address how the strong dollar and the weak oil price could impact the broader emerging market demand for infrastructure. I wonder are you seeing any backlog or project deferrals as a result of that?","Jeff Bornstein","So I will start. There is multiple dimensions of those obviously. My comment was at about 1.50 and 1.60, we\u2019ve opened up softer than that this morning. It\u2019s about a penny a share. I mean we do hedges \u2013 we are not a 100% hedged, we hedge all our transactional exposure to the extent we can, we do -- we are subject to some translation and we do very short-term hedging around earnings in a quarter. So there will be some volatility associated with currency but I think my point was that in the context of the company we're not at a point yet where we think it's something that's not manageable across our portfolio. We do have natural hedging, we have the ability in some of our businesses to move our manufacturing base globally which allows us to take advantage of changes in currency and in a couple of our businesses where that matters we are actively looking at our build plan for the year to make sure we take as much advantage of that as possible. ","I would in the short run here we've seen very little that I am aware of, very little impact on our order performance as a result of currency. That may play out more in 2015 but through fourth quarter of this year we've seen very little of that.","Jeff Immelt","And I would say on \u2013 you had a multi \u2013 both currency and oil price, I think if you took a tour around the world, look, our biggest market is still the US. The US had orders of 25% in the third quarter and 18% in the fourth quarter. So I would always start by reminding people that actually the US is the best we've seen since the financial crisis and then what we call rising Asia, Nigel, which is really China, India, ASEAN, stuff like that, those are actually quite positive for us right now from a order standpoint. And then the resource rich countries I think are going to be mixed, depending on what your cost position is and things like that. So we still I would say on an underlying basis see pretty good underlying demand in the Middle East but clearly places that are marginal producers like Iraq or Venezuela things like that. Those are going to be places that we\u2019re not counting on much business in 2015. So it\u2019s kind of a mixed bag. ","And in Europe \u2013 Europe for us is flattish, I\u2019d say if you look at the organic and if the stimulus increases European demand, that\u2019s a good thing for us. ","Nigel Coe ","And then just switching to the mix in 2015, and obviously tremendous margin expansion on services in 4Q, how does the 150 bps look between service and OE in \u201815? And how does the mix shake out on the 2% to 5% between OE and service?","Jeff Immelt","I think if you look at in the 2014 I would say product margins were flattish and service margins were up. And look, we described to you guys -- we described to our investors in December kind of an extremely intense focus on gross margins and product costs. And so our expectation is that delivers in 2015, so we\u2019re looking to get some OE margin enhancement in \u201915 along with the continued service enhancement, and then Jeff, do you know on the revenue mix? ","Jeff Bornstein","Well I will just say on the revenue mix, equipment service would be a little less impactful next year than it was in \u201914. That's our plan. I think the gross margin focus that we have going, which is particularly centered on product service cost is driving at the OE market \u2013","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray ","Hey, a couple questions. First for you, Jeff Immelt, a macro strategic question regarding balancing your framework priorities. And then I've got one for Jeff Bornstein about truing up on tax and restructuring benefits. So, to start on the macro question, you're pretty clear you're in a volatile environment. But I'd love to get an update on how you are balancing the framework priorities. You've got longer-term big mix changes and could be near-term disruptive to the organization; and then meanwhile you're on an EPS framework with a cadence of earnings, quarterly earnings. And I've always called it a bit like trying to change a car tire going down the highway at 55 miles an hour. So how are you balancing these big mix changes versus earnings expectations for 2015?","Jeff Immelt","The best way I can describe it, Deane, is since I would say -- since 2013 inside the company or even longer we've been kind of talking about it executing around this kind of mix shift that we\u2019ve described to investors. I think Jeff earlier in the presentation talked about the investments we've made in restructuring in 2014 to kind of set us up for 2015 and beyond which again everybody in the leadership team is on. So the way I\u2019d look at this, Deane, is on the industrial side I think the teams \u2013 their world is in front of them, their incentives are in, they know exactly what they need to do. We\u2019ve got Alstom coming in, appliances going out and that is that team is laserlike focused between Dave Joyce and Lorenzo and Steve Bolze and those guys know exactly what they need to do in this environment. At GE Capital, look, we\u2019re just going to make it smaller if we can as time goes on. We\u2019re going to execute on Synchrony and that\u2019s what the Capital team is doing. And so I think you got to look at it in terms of every team knows exactly what they're pieced of how we need to execute here. There is no \u2013 absolutely no confusion on industrial side and financial services we\u2019re just going to look for opportunities to continue to make it smaller. ","We talked about 75:25 as a goal but we\u2019ve really run the place, with that as an output function and an input function. We run the place to execute well on our businesses and we think 75:25 is the output. ","Deane Dray ","And then for Jeff Bornstein, maybe you can true us up on the tax outlook for 2015 and restructuring benefits that should carry in, and anything unique about the first-quarter tax?","Jeff Bornstein","Sure. So industrial tax, we think is going to be the core rate, it will be what it has been which is high teens. We will do the appliance transaction, that will be a high tax transaction which will bump the rate up to low 20s for next year. And I think that's consistent with what we\u2019ve communicated. The plan will probably be higher in the early part of the year, lower in the latter part of the year on industrial tax.","On restructuring, same discussion, that we\u2019re going to do restructuring next year. It is critical to delivering on everything we\u2019ve talked about. We've assumed the gains, the appliances of signalling transaction happen midyear, we will do restructuring in the first half of the year before those gains manifest themselves. But we still believe that for the total year our restructuring and gains, and to some degree the impact of mortality are all going to offset, we\u2019re not going to be doing today anyway naked restructuring.","Deane Dray ","What's the carryforward of restructuring benefits in 2015 from actions in 2014?","Jeff Bornstein","What we\u2019ve got to now make up in our cost roll is about $500 million. We will get an incremental benefit for new restructuring we do in \u201915, as you know we\u2019ll get partially depending on where we execute those projects. But the carry through from, I would say both \u201913 and \u201814 is about $500 million for 2015. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven Winoker ","Hey, could you just give us a better sense of the detail around the gains that happened within GE Capital in the quarter? Just the major gains including -- as well as the real estate side, but across the whole business. And did the Norges thing come through all that?","Jeff Bornstein","So I will start with Norges. So we did close Norges. The impact in the quarter was just over $300 million. The headline impact in the segment reporting in retail was a full 600 million, and that\u2019s partly because we did the tax accounting earlier in the year that recognized the tax benefits for about half the gain. We reversed that in the fourth quarter and the full effect of the disposition took place in the fourth quarter in the retail segment. So within the fourth quarter about $300 million, $600 million for the year. In addition, I talked about we sold the nonperforming loan portfolio in our UK home lending business about a half billion dollars at a very small gain associated with that about $20 million but a big deal for our UK portfolio. ","I talked about $2.1 billion of real estate sales in the quarter that led by Japan multifamily that we sold, that specifically was about 229 million, and the total real estate gains for quarter were closer to $330 million. And that made the bulk of where GE Capital gains were in the quarter. ","Steven Winoker ","And then just maybe pausing on the order price profile for the quarter and the trend line in some of these. I know we've talked about oil and gas a little bit; it was down 20 basis points and power and water down 70. Are you seeing pressure in the existing backlog at all in terms of any kind of renegotiation activity happening? And also, currency, are you also feeling any pressure? We talked about currency a little bit, but are you feeling any pressure to use pricing to make up for any of the segments, whether it's power, healthcare, or lighting, where you might have broader international competition, any of that coming through? And then healthcare I guess as part of that same thing, which is -- I know this is the business model, to be down every quarter and take costs down by more. But that can't be a good thing for too long. So maybe some thoughts on that too.","Jeff Immelt","Steve, here is what I would say. I would say most of the pricing impact that we see in the fourth quarter is more mix driven than anything else. For instance, in power you\u2019ve got -- most of the heavy duty gas turbine action is in the edge, that really is not in the base yet but those are higher price bigger units, little more competitive scenarios but not a lot to talk about. Oil and gas, we really haven't seen it yet, nor have we seen \u2013 there are some initial letters and stuff like that on pricing but no real action. I think that's all -- again I don't think we\u2019ve seen it in the fourth quarter. We haven't seen it yet but this is early days. So I think there is going to be \u2013 there\u2019s still going to be chatter out there. So I don't really take all the stuff that's happened necessarily in the fourth quarter as what's going to happen throughout the rest of \u201915. I just think we have to be ready on all fronts and I would say no conversation all around currency and anything along that yet. We will see how that plays out. ","In terms of healthcare, look, I think you\u2019re right. This has been the historical business model but I also think kind of what we are doing with, Steve, with Jeff and Jamie, Dan Heintzelman is we\u2019re ripping apart the critical axis is gross margins across each one of these businesses. And I think in healthcare managing the pricing is going to be a key part of how we get enhanced gross margin improvement in that specific business. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa ","Just to make one thing clear, what were the impairments in the fourth quarter? Total gains of $650 million in GE Capital, what were the impairments?","Jeff Bornstein","Hold on one sec, I will get it for you. What\u2019s your next question, Steve and I will run that down?","Steve Tusa ","My next question would be another detail question. Lufkin specifically in artificial lift, we've seen some varying reports on inventory destocking. I think PCP yesterday talked about their oil and gas business, implied down like 50% to 60% in some of their -- on a quarterly run rate basis, showed some destocking. Did you guys see destocking in your artificial lift business, the Lufkin business?","Jeff Immelt","Not yet, Steve. Look, when you look at like revenues in the quarter were up mid single digits in Lufkin. Orders were kind of down mid-single digits. So not enough to read into. Again a lot of this I think is \u2013 and oil and gas is yet to play out. But I would say the fourth quarter was pretty much inside of our expectations for Lufkin. ","Steve Tusa ","And then just one last question just on cash. Jeff, just philosophically around the dividend, you guys are bumping up against an 80%-ish type of payout ratio on the free cash when it comes to the dividend. I mean, there is a pretty significant -- it's a big dividend relative to your free cash flow. Is that dividend viewed -- I mean, is there a fine line here given obviously the location of cash makes it a little bit complicated as far as moving things around and being able to pay that? Would you -- is there a fine line as a percentage of free cash flow that you don't mind going over industrial free cash flow and paying the dividend? I mean is it -- and as far as growth, do you view the dividend, it's a must-grow over time? I'm just trying to get my hands around how much you defend that dividend.","Jeff Immelt","Look, Steve, you\u2019ve got $16 billion of cash on the balance sheet right now. We\u2019re going to do Alstom this year. You are still sitting on top of a substantial excess cash in GE Capital. Look, I view the dividend as being key. We have choice -- we have capital allocation choices we make. We\u2019re going to continue to grow our free cash flow as time goes on and we\u2019re comfortable with where we are right now. ","Jeff Bornstein","I\u2019d say listen, we\u2019ve been running at slightly about a 50% payout ratio. I think long-term we expect to be slightly less or to about 50% payout ratio. So as we work through the pivot, through 2016 we\u2019ve made a conscious decision that we are going to run a little harder to our target payout ratio but the dividend as Jeff said is certainly a priority for us and very important to our retail base.","Jeff Immelt","And I would add, Steve, just one \u2013 just something that I just want to make sure people don't forget and that is, look, the Synchrony transaction is effectively going to be at $20 billion buyback that whenever we execute that, so that's a big \u2013 another big capital allocation choice, it's just going to be executed in a different way but that\u2019s quite meaningful to our investors as well. ","Steve Tusa ","Sure, and the impairments?","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, impairment. So as you would expect impairments year-over-year were down substantially about $550 million. You recall in the fourth quarter of last year within CLL, we took the moment of charge and we took a little \u2013 we took the second charge on business aircraft and then the big item in the fourth quarter of last year was the GECAS aircraft impairment. So year-over-year impairments were better by $550 million pretax. But in the quarter we really didn't have a lot of big impairments, we had one big impairment on a real estate property domestically for just under $100 million pretax and that was really about it of consequence. ","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague ","Hey, just a couple quick ones. I know we are running tight on time. Could you just reconcile the comment on Lufkin orders down mid single digit versus drilling orders down 72%? I know, obviously, there is a little bit more but that's a little bit of difference there. But that sounds like a fairly sizable disconnect.","Jeff Immelt","Yes, look, I am just looking at fourth quarter orders, Jeff. ","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, so we report Lufkin separately from drilling and surface. Drilling and surface orders were up 4% in the quarter. So identical to what you would expect in this environment and Lufkin was down 6% in the quarter. So I would say generally if you look at the \u2013 as I went through the script, if you look at the orders for oil and gas in the quarter, they are not necessarily what you would expect in this environment. The things you would be -- think would be stronger, including downstream and the surface related stuff, turbo machinery, were good to slightly down and the things you think would be most impact, the upstream stuff was a little stronger in the quarter year over year. ","So I think we\u2019re way too early \u2013 you are not yet seeing an impact on behavior with our customer in the current order rate. That\u2019s to come in 2015. ","Jeff Sprague ","You did say drilling down 72%, is that right?","Jeff Immelt","No.","Jeff Bornstein","Drilling was down, surface was up. So drilling POPs were down substantially but surface was up. We report it as drilling and surface.","Jeff Sprague ","And I know the H price is not in the index, but can you give some color on how that's pricing versus expectation?","Jeff Bornstein","Well, it\u2019s not in the index, I would say without giving away any real competitive information I would say sequentially pricing is improving, order to order. ","Jeff Sprague ","And then just one really quick one on FX. Is the $0.01 headwind or so that you are talking about for 2015 now incremental to what you were thinking previously? And the reason I ask is you had $0.02 in Q \u2013 ","Jeff Bornstein","Yes, Jeff. So what I was trying to say was when we did the framework in December, if you look at that versus I did that math, 115 and 116, the move from December to 115 to 116 for us meant that we were working with a penny headwind that we would figure out. ","Jeff Sprague ","But again I would come back to, there is other mitigants to a lot of those stuff.","Jeff Bornstein","I am not changing guidance in any way. I am not changing \u2013","Jeff Immelt","We\u2019re trying to give you guys the pieces because I think that\u2019s \u2013 we want you to know how we think about it but there's a lot of other things inside the company that we use \u2013 just like we did in Q4. ","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Obin of Bank of America ","Andrew Obin ","Hey, just a question, two questions. The first, part of the reason for creating oil and gas was actually to deliver to national oil companies in an environment like this. Could you share some of the conversations that you are having with these customers? And how are you guys positioning versus the competition? And are you seeing that your structure is actually making a difference? From the outside, how do we know that it does make a difference?","Jeff Immelt","Well, look, I would say again there is not one-size-fits-all but I think clearly the national oil companies look differently at this cycle than some of the integrated oil companies do. So I would just say in the case of a company like Saudi Aramco they are going to continue to produce and there is a number of strategies that are associated with that, similarly to a company like Petronas and things like that. And then there's other places that are in more stress. So look, I would just echo back, Andrew, to some comment I made in December, we like the oil and gas business, we like how we are positioned in it and we think these cycles give us an opportunity to pick up market position similar to what we did in the aviation business and the power business and other businesses. ","But sort of going through private conversations with customers, I can just say that we still think with a lot of the NOCs, or a certain segment of the NOCs there\u2019s still potentially going to be some good business to be done in 2015.","Andrew Obin ","And just to follow up, what's the latest strategic thinking on energy management and the progress that they are making?","Jeff Immelt","Look, I think we're in a pretty good \u2013 we\u2019re in a pretty good strategic position. This is a business where Alstom adds some competitive capability and scale and our pathway has to be one that gets us to margins that are more competitive with the ABBs and the other players in this industry and that's -- and we can accept nothing less. So I think the way I look at it right now, Andrew, to win, we expect margin accretion and earnings growth year after year in this business and here's one where the ceiling is very high in terms of what we should be able to do in this business. ","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan ","Hey, maybe first for Jeff Bornstein. When you think about driving this thing from down 80 bps gross margin this year to up 50, how do you see that phasing through 2015 numerically? And also where are you and Dan and Jamie at in terms of what you're doing to drive that?","Jeff Bornstein","So right now, Shannon, we're doing very deep dives with each business and basically I hate to get too tactical but basically we\u2019re starting with the outcome and building back the project decks from there. So on every element of product and service costs, direct material, inflation deflation direct material usage, warranties, scrap, operating cost per hour of our different facilities, every labor etc. building the project decks that support delivering at each of the segment levels, their share of gross margin improvement at the segment level. And that's where we are today. Jamie in parallel with that is continuing to drive and support the businesses with the ERP which is a big part of giving them visibility and driving our ability to consolidate etc. So we're in the process right now of building very detailed action oriented plans that have every dollar of cost between sales and the gross margin line owned by somebody with a plan. So that's where we are today. I would say this is going to accelerate throughout the year. We\u2019re early in the process now but I am quite confident if we get out of the way we have programmatically around SG&A I think we can make a big difference here and I think there's a lot of opportunity, as Jeff said earlier particularly around original equipment margins.","Shannon O'Callaghan ","And then in terms of just the US healthcare strength, can you give us a little more color there? What are you hearing from customers and where do you really think that market is and decision-making is at this point?","Jeff Immelt","So Shannon, the only two data points I can give you is just kind of what we saw which was pretty good -- we don't have the market data yet, so we don't know share and things like that. But we have good products and good activity and we got to believe that we gained a little bit of share. ","And I would say the other data point I can give you is conversational which is \u2013 as I see hospital CEOs when I travel the circuit, you just get a lot more positive in terms of their ability to know what the next few years are going to be like to do their planning, to do their growth plans and things like that and that didn\u2019t exist let\u2019s say 24 months ago. So we\u2019re guardedly optimistic but it's too early to call it a trend I would say.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian Mitchell ","Hi, thanks. Just on the healthcare business, you talked about how the Q4 performance was something of a blip. But I guess the profit drivers down, price and FX probably persist through the whole of this year. So maybe talk a little bit about why you're so confident that healthcare earnings are going to rebound.","Jeff Immelt","Again I would say, Julian, on the comment you made this is \u2013 as Jeff went through in his presentation that there is always going to be concerned about FX and stuff like that in this business. Nonetheless the US is just a big powerful driver of healthcare profitability mix, things like that. And so when I look at 2015 that in addition to momentum we\u2019ve got in life sciences and stuff like that, I think that offsets all the other let\u2019s say headwinds we might see in terms of FX and otherwise. ","Jeff Bornstein","Julian, I\u2019d just add, I didn\u2019t, if you took it that way, I apologize. I didn\u2019t mean describe the healthcare performance as a blip. But what I meant to say was organically the performance was better than headline, when you think about the impacts of FX. So and I completely agree with Jeff, I mean when you \u2013 the developed markets feel like they are getting stronger for healthcare we\u2019re going to have challenges and some \u2013 Russia or some of the emerging markets. But the bulk of our percentage wise -- the US is still the biggest single market we have in healthcare and we feel much better about the strength there than we have in the past.","Julian Mitchell ","And then just the gross margin up by 50 bps. What are you including for price or for value gap in there? Because I guess value gap was a decent tailwind in 2014. Do you think it's flattish this year?","Jeff Bornstein","I think in our working construct for the year, we expect value gap to be roughly what it was this year. So we ended this year at about $300 million net value gap and $300 million value gap. And our expectation is that that will likely be what 2015 look like.","End of Q&A","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Cribbins, do you have any additional remarks?","Matthew Cribbins","Yes, thank you. Before wrapping up, just a couple of quick announcements. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We will be distributing our quarterly supplement for GE Capital later today. On Friday, April 17 we will hold our first quarter 2015 earnings webcast. ","Jeff Immelt","Great. Matt, I just want to reiterate as we close. The framework we\u2019ve got for \u201815 really has a ton of strength and thoughtfulness in it in terms of the scenarios that we\u2019re seeing globally. So I would just echo that and just reiterate we talked about the new compensation plan that the leaders have inside the company, that really has each and every business aligned to deliver right in a very effective way for our investors as we go forward, Matt. So I would just make those two points in closing. ","Matthew Cribbins","Thank you. And as always we will be available later today for questions. ","Operator","This concludes your conference call.

To drive a more strategic discussion on the call, we\u2019ll be inviting business leaders to participate to talk about their business, markets, new product introductions and major initiatives. We\u2019ve asked Rod to join today to talk about Subsea.","Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey Immelt","Thanks, Matt, and good morning everybody. The GE team had a good quarter and have also been improving environment. The U.S gets a little bit better every day. Europe is improving. The growth markets continue to expand and will provide growth during the year, even with volatility. We had strength across most of our portfolio as global infrastructure markets remained solid. We continued to benefit in energy, oil and gas and aviation sectors and we saw some improvement in the demand for credit. At the same time we encountered a few headwinds in the quarter. Weather impacted our appliances business, but improved in March. Transportation was impacted by mining inventory corrections and the U.S healthcare market continued to experience volatility. Some of this improved as the quarter progressed. ","Our execution was strong. Industrial segment growth was up 12% above our 10% goal. Organic growth was up 8% above our 4% to 7% goal. Margin growth was 50 basis points and we\u2019re on track to meet our goal of 17% margins by 2016. Our capital earnings and cash were in line with our expectations for the year. We returned $2.4 billion to investors in dividends and buyback and announced $2 billion bolt-on acquisitions. And finally, we submitted our SEC filing Synchrony, the RFS spinoff. This is an important step as we head for our 70% industrial goal. We delivered $0.33 of operating EPS at 9%, excluding the impact of NBCU gains in 2013 restructuring. This is the kind of quarter GE investors should like. The environment was not perfect, but we were able to deliver strong results due to the breadth of our portfolio.","Orders were flat overall. Backlog grew to $245 billion and orders pricing was up 0.4 points. While equipment orders can be lumpy, service orders, things like aviation spares, tend to be a good gauge of the underlying economy and we saw broad strength in our service businesses with four of six segments up double digits. Six of nine growth regions grew orders by double digits in the quarter. Equipment orders were down in aviation and oil and gas versus tough comps in 2013. We have a great backlog in position in each market and feel good about the long term growth. In transportation we see a strengthening market for North American locomotives and we won a very large order for kits for South Africa. I wanted to point out two other factors on orders. First we see the pipeline building so we feel good about growth during the year. And second, we have grown backlog by $29 billion from the first quarter of 2013 with growth in every segment. This fortifies our ability to hit goals this year and in the future.","The company executed well in the first quarter. Industrial operating profit growth of 12% is a good start to the year. Organic growth was up 8%. Growth markets continue to provide momentum with five of nine up double digits and 7% growth overall. We made great progress in services with aviation spares up 22% and 17 Advanced Gas Paths, up from two last year. Equipment revenue grew by 12%. Our products are winning in the market with excellent growth in power, oil and gas, and aviation. For instance we are well positioned throughout our gas turbine product line, extending to the H turbine which has more than 61% efficiency and more than 400 megawatts of output. Our Revolution CT just received FDA approval and should drive positive growth for the year. ","Europe grew by 14% in the first quarter. So we\u2019re starting to get stabilization in that market as well. Our target is to grow margins this year. We\u2019re off to a good start. This is our fourth consecutive quarter of expansion with 50 basis points of growth. We\u2019re driving simplification throughout the company and our restructuring efforts are paying off. We generated about $250 million of structural costs out of the quarter and value gap had a positive 50 basis point impact on margins. We\u2019re gaining traction with our Fast Works initiative which is improving R&D efficiency. Mix was a headwind, but our productivity programs more than offset. Finally, we expect broader business participation in the future Healthcare, Energy Management, and Appliances & Lighting should have positive margin and operating profit expansion for the rest of 2014 based on improving markets and restructuring. ","Our CFOA is off to a good start and on track for the year. We generated $1.7 billion, up from 4200 million from last year. The company has substantial financial strength, with $87 billion of consolidated cash and close to $12 billion at the Parent. As you know, we issued $3 billion of debt in the quarter. GE Capital remains in great shape, with a Tier 1 common ratio of 11.4%. Meanwhile Commercial Paper was in a very low level of $25 billion. The total ENI of $374 billion was down 7%. We\u2019ve allocated capital in a disciplined and balanced way. We continue to invest in plant and equipment to grow the company globally. Our dividend is up 16% year-over-year. We plan to reduce the float in 2014 and we\u2019re on track to reduce share count to 9 million to 9.5 million shares by the end of 2015, including the retail spend. ","We will continue to bolt-on acquisitions like the three we announced so far this year. Our targets remain $1 billion to $4 billion, but we have gone above on opportunistic deals that have excellent values, strong synergies, fit our growth strategies and are immediately accretive. For instance, Avio was above our range and accretive to investors. At the same time we plan for about $4 billion of dispositions this year. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rod Christie who runs our Subsea business as Matt said earlier. We plan to review an important segment or initiative each quarter. As the year goes on, we plan to cover topics like heavy duty gas turbine technology, Healthcare and Life Sciences, China or other important operating initiatives or organic growth opportunities. So now I\u2019ll turn it over to Rod.","Rod Christie","Thanks, Jeff. So starting on the left side of the page, I want to give you a flavor of how we see the long term prospect for oil and gas industry before we drill into the Subsea sector specifically. The forecast is for global oil and gas demand to continue to grow through 2018, with oil mainly driven by the ongoing industrialization and emerging economies and the rise of living standards, while gas emerges across mainly all of the economies as a cleaner fuel source. In addition to the increasing demand, the other dynamic to consider here is well decline rates on existing operations of around 3% to 4% onshore and 6% to 10% offshore. The combination of both these factors makes ongoing investment necessary to develop new reserves and enhance the recovery in existing assets. ","Moving to the top right of the page, we see these dynamics driving 4% and 2% CAGRs in production rates for oil and gas respectively through 2018. The expectation is for stronger growth in Subsea and unconventional production. Translating all of this into total industry spend, we expect to see continued growth as high NOCs and independents work to recover more hydrocarbons from existing assets and bring on new reserves to meet the growing demand. ","With respect to Subsea sector, the expectation for long term development of deep water reserves is supported by the robust activity we see in drilling in front end engineering design through the cycle. Given this expectation, our Subsea Systems business is well positioned to serve customers with both technology and life-of-field services across the globe. Our extensive capabilities enable us to provide everything from discrete components to full Subsea production systems. We\u2019re also uniquely placed against our competitors and that we can leverage technology from other GE businesses and run joint technology program specific to the critical need. ","To give you a couple of examples here, we cooperate with GE\u2019s monitoring and controls business in the area of Subsea integrity management and leverage their sensory and diagnostics technology specifically developed for our own space. We\u2019re also running a joint technology program with GE\u2019s power conversion business for Subsea power and drive. This really enables us to develop value added solutions under one roof wherever the core competency actually exists inside GE. ","Likewise, GE gives us the ability to scale up. As many of you be aware, localization is often a mandatory requirement on our industry. When we move into new geographies, it\u2019s not unusual to find other GE businesses are already there. Usually it is either Power and Water or another oil and gas business. This means we can leverage their relationships, their knowledge and potentially their footprint. Additionally, we\u2019ve been working with GE\u2019s global growth and operation team to accelerate development in countries like Nigeria, and Angola where we can benefit from their high level relationship and the back office support to get things up and running very quickly. ","Today, we\u2019re present in all the major deep water basins around the world such as Brazil, sub Saharan Africa, Asia and Australia while still retaining significant capability around both the UK and Norwegian continental shell. Our experience in extreme cold water and long step out capabilities for controls and propeller solutions position as well for future activity, a sector that\u2019s going to require really no topsides and has the added complexity really of an icebound environment. So three years ago, a major Subsea industry survey took feedback from 135 customers and ranked each supplier against the top priorities of the subsea oil and gas operators. ","The chart on the left of this page details how GE was rated against our competitors back in 2012. As you can see, we performed well in the key areas like EHS, reliability and technology. However we were mid pack when it came to on time delivery. And in fact really none of the suppliers are performing consistently to acceptable level in this critical requirement. This is one of the main risks to both the supplier and the customer in this industry. And a significant number of large-scale Subsea developments experienced both schedule and cost overrun. Given that he timing and carrying costs for initial CapEx outlay on these projects, the key driver in overall returns, we have focused investment to differentiate performance around cycle and on time delivery. As of today, we offer a suite of structured products that offer modular customization to our customers. ","So let me expand a little bit on modularization. What that really means is we can provide exactly what a customer wants. So we do it with less engineering and less supply chain risk as we use a standard module to do so. We\u2019ve also completed significant process reengineering to drive speed and transparency across our business operations. We\u2019ve created a global project COE that interfaces directly through all of our sites and suppliers, and supports our project teams wherever they\u2019re operating in the world. ","To underpin this, we\u2019ve also invested in an integrated IP infrastructure, enables us to scale the organization though industry cycles without losing either capability or impacting our operational excellence. The final piece of this jigsaw really has been the investments we\u2019ve made in creating new capacity and unlocking latent capacity in a number of our factories. Today using lean manufacturing disciplines, we\u2019ve increased capacity for trees, controls, well heads and manifolds. In general, we\u2019ve been able to realize capacity increases between 30% and 100% in our existing facilities and have commissioned new capacity in Indonesia and Brazil. And sure we feel we\u2019re very well placed to take on new commitments.","Growth in the deep water oil and gas sector looks strong over the long term and we feel very confident about our competitiveness of both our existing product line and the technologies we have in development. The investments we\u2019ve made in capacity and capability also put us in a great position for our customer wherever they operate in the world. ","Just to give you some context on the evolution of the Subsea System Business. In 2011 we were executing a handful of small projects and two Subsea production EPC projects, the largest of which was around $600 million. Today we\u2019re executing 8 EPC projects, the largest of which exceeds $1.3 billion. The programs we\u2019ve undertaken to structure our products, lean out supply chain and project operations are yielding results in cycle time reduction and cost reduction. And we expect to see further benefits come from these as we drive these deeper into our business. ","Just to give you some context here, 1Q revenue we saw 37% increase year-over-year and a 3x increase in both margin and in rate. On top of this, our global footprint really makes us take local and capable in the main deep water basins today and GE\u2019s reach means we can move quickly and at scale in any of the developing geographies. Overall we really feel very good about the fundamentals of this business and it\u2019s -- really have to say that I\u2019m very excited about the way this moves in the future. ","So with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Jeff. ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Great. Thanks Rod. I\u2019m going to start with operations in the quarter, then we\u2019ll move through the segments. ","We had continuing operations revenues of $34.2 billion, down 2% from the first quarter of 2013. Industrial sales of $24 billion were up 8% and GE Capital revenues of $10.5 billion were down 8%. Operating earnings of $3.3 billion were down 18% and operational earnings per share of $0.33 were down 15%, principally driven by NBC as Jeff mentioned earlier. ","On the next page, I\u2019ll take you through more detail on the normalized EPS work versus last year. Continuing EPS of $0.29 includes the impact of non-operating pensions and net earnings per share of $0.30 includes the impact of discontinued operations. We had $12 million benefits in the quarter in discontinued operations with no material impact from WMC. Pending claims at WMC declined to $4.5 billion, reflecting $1.2 billion of resolutions, with reserves declining in line with expectations. New pending claims in the quarter were negligible. ","As Jeff said, first quarter CFOA was $1.7 billion, with industrial cash flow of $1.2 billion and received 500 million of dividends in GE capital. The GE tax rate for the quarter was 24% and the GE Capital rate was 9%. For the year we\u2019re still expecting the GE rate to be around 20% and the GE Capital rate to be in the single digits. On the right side, you can see the segment results. And as Jeff mentioned, performance was mixed by business, but overall pretty good with industrial segment revenues up 8% and operating profit up 12%. GE Capital earnings were flat in the quarter on lower assets. ","Now I\u2019ll take you through the dynamics of each of the segments on the pages that follow. And first on the other items page, I\u2019ll start with adjusted EPS walk. So last year as you recall we had operating EPS of $0.39 in the first quarter. This included $0.10 of gains and income from NBC that was offset by $ 0.04 of industrial restructuring and other items. We also had a $0.05 gain at GE Capital from the sale of 30 Rock that was offset by other charges as well. That walk gets you to an adjusted operating EPS of $0.33 last year. This quarter we had $0.03 of industrial restructuring and other items. Making the same adjustment for \u201814 gets you the $0.36, and that\u2019s up 9% on an adjusted basis. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about operating performance in the quarter. ","On the right side as I mentioned, we had $0.03 of charges related to industrial restructuring other items as we continue to invest in simplification to improve the company\u2019s cost structure. The spend was broad based with projects in every business and corporate. We\u2019re executing more than 150 projects at average about a year and a half payback. The projects relate to everything from manufacturing footprint reduction, service shop consolidations, SG&A actions and exiting low margin product lines, primarily in developed markets. We\u2019re continuing to work through timing of European work council approvals. And on the positive side some of the projects are coming in below our regional cost estimates with no downgrade in benefits. ","For the year, we still anticipate $1 billion to $1.5 billion of restructuring, with about 60% of that in the first half. And we\u2019re still planning on delivering more than $1 billion industrial costs out for the year. As we told you in November, we expect to have some dispositions in our industrial portfolio in 2014 and we\u2019re currently working on a transaction related to a non-core asset that may result in a small gain likely in the second quarter, potentially in the third quarter. ","Now I\u2019ll take you through each of the segments, starting with Power and Water. Orders of $5.7 billion were up 9%. Equipment orders of $2.6 billion were down 3%, driven by renewables down 13%. That was partially offset by distributive power, which was up 9% and thermal was up 3%. Wind orders totaled 422 turbines versus 584 in the first quarter of \u201813. Our view of wind orders for the year has not changed. We still expect strong growth. We took orders for 31 gas turbines in the first quarter of this year versus eight a year ago. Service orders were $3.1 billion, higher by 23%. The growth was primarily driven by PGS up 32%, up 43% ex Europe. The business had orders for 17 EGPs versus two a year ago as well as a large $330 million upgrade order in Japan. Europe continues to be very, very soft. ","Backlog in power and water continued to grow, with equipment higher by 18% and services by 2% year-over-year. OPI in the quarter was negative 40 basis points driven by equipment. Revenue in the quarter of 5.5 billion was up 14%. Equipment revenues were up 41% driven by wind shipments of 646 units, 345 units higher than the first quarter of 2013 and thermal was up five gas turbines, shipping 17 versus 12 a year ago. We shipped all but one wind turbine associated with blade quality from the fourth quarter. Service revenues were down 5% as AGP performance was offset by weakness in Euro. Segment operating profit was 24% higher on strong volume and simplification benefits, partly offset by negative mix associated with wind. SG&A in the quarter was down 9% year over year. The wind blade quality issues in the quarter were negligible. Margins expanded for the quarter 120 basis points. ","Next is oil and gas. Oil and gas orders for the quarter of $4.6 billion were down 5% with equipment orders down 17% and service growth of 11%. Equipment orders were down versus tough comparison to last year when orders were up 24%. Subsidy equipment was down 62% principally on timing. As we\u2019ve commented previously, orders in oil gas tend to be very lumpy on a quarterly basis. And as Rod shared with you, we expect subsidy orders to be up double digits for the total year. ","We continue to see good growth in Turbomachinery solutions, up 16% in the quarter and two large wins in the US LNG space. And Downstream technology was also strong, up 48%. Service orders of 2.2 billion were higher by 11%, led by Turbomachinery, up 22% and downstream technology solutions up 20%. That was partly offset by MNC which was down 7%. Backlog continues to grow in oil and gas with equipment up 15% and services up 4% versus prior year. Orders pricing was better by 140 basis points in the quarter. Revenue was up 27% up18% ex-Lufkin. And subsidy was up 37%, Turbomachinery up 25%, downstream solutions up 24% and drilling and surface was up 13%, while MNC was down 4%. We expect MNC to be flat for the total year.","Operating profit was strong in the quarter, up 37%, up 28% ex-Lufkin. The growth is driven by volume, value gap base cost productivity in the absence of the FX charge we had last year in the first quarter. This was partly offset by negative mix on lower MNC volume. Our operating profit rate improved 80 basis points in the quarter both with and without Lufkin. ","So turning to the next page on aviation, just some context here. Air travel continued to grow strongly. Global revenue passenger kilometers grew 6.9% through February compared to 5.2% a year ago with a particular strength in the Middle East, Asia, Europe and China. Through February, freight growth was up 3.6% versus 1.4% a year ago and that growth was driven by Latin America, Europe and the Middle East. Orders in the quarter of $5.5 billion were down 17% as expected, driven by equipment orders down 38% to $2.4 billion. ","The first quarter of 2013 we had $1.4 billion of CFM LEAP launch orders and two large China G 90 orders. Commercial engine backlog ended the quarter at $21 billion. That\u2019s 68% higher versus last year. The military equipment orders of $421 million were up 44% driven by demand for CT7 engines. Services orders were $3.1 billion, up 10%. And commercial service orders were up 12%, driven by strong commercial spare parts, up 17% to $29.7 million a day. Military service orders were up 18% driven by spare parts, up 19% on strong demand for T700 spares. Orders pricing was strong at 2.6% for the quarter. ","Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 14%, up 10% ex Avio. Equipment revenue was higher by 14% on strong price and shipments of 646 commercial engines versus 596 last year. We shipped 70 GEnx engines versus 41 a year ago and military revenues were down 3% on 31 fewer engines in the quarter. Service revenue $2.9 billion was up 14% driven by commercial up 18% and military down five. Commercial spare shipments were $28.5 million a day. That was up 22% versus last year. Operating profit of $1.1 billion was up 19%, 14% ex Avio on strong value gap in volume. Margin rates improved 90 basis points, 80 basis points ex Avio. Avio continues to perform very well, an overall good execution in the aviation business in the quarter.","Next on healthcare; the first quarter in the US was soft. Hospitals and clinics appear to be delaying purchases and responses to the ACA. Patient inflows, outpatient visits, ER, surgeries procedures were all down 1% to 1.7% in a quarter. Preliminary NEMA data suggests the U.S market was down single digits excluding one big VA bulk order from several years ago. Our NEMA orders were down 2%. So we believe we actually gained share in the quarter a point or two. As a result of these dynamics, healthcare\u2019s first quarter was softer than we expected.","Orders of $4.2 billion were down 1% driven by the U.S down 4%, offset by continued strength in emerging markets, which were up 10%. China was up 13%, Latin America was up 10%, and the Middle East was up 47%. Europe was also strong, up 4%. Equipment orders of $2.3 billion were flat and HCS emerging market orders were higher by 13%, offset by the U.S down 12%. Life science orders were up 1% in the quarter. Service orders were $1.9 billion, and they were down 2% in the quarter.","First quarter backlog was $16.3 billion, which was up 7% versus prior year, and order pricing was down 1.5%. Revenues of $4.2 billion were down 2% with equipment down 2%, and services down 3%. Operating profit of $570 million was down 4%, driven by negative value gap, offset by strong base course management. SG&A in our healthcare business was down 9% in the quarter. The business expects the U.S softness to probably persist in the second quarter, but expect to continue to gain share and deliver earnings growth through the year.","So with that we\u2019ll move to transportation. Transportation had a solid execution quarter given their environment. In terms of domestic activity, car loads were up 1% in the first quarter, driven by intermodal traffic which was higher by 3%. Coal volume continues to be soft. It was down 1%, but petroleum products and petroleum were higher 6.5%. Orders for the quarter were $2.4 billion. That was up over 100%, led by equipment orders up four times. We had orders for 259 locos, and 299 loco kits, versus 80 locos last year and 25 kits a year ago. We received a large order from South Africa for 233 kits, and had order is for 176 locos in the U.S.","Service orders were down 18% due to weak mining and no repeat of the large Amtrak signaling order we had in the first quarter of last year. Order price index was flat and backlog was 6% versus the first quarter of \u201813. ","Revenues for the quarter were down 14% as we anticipated. Equipment was down 20%, driven by mining off-highway vehicles down 76%, partly offset by locomotives up 23%. We shipped 178 locos versus 143 a year ago. Service was down 7% on weaker mining parts demand. ","Op profit was down 24%. Very strong cost and productivity performance was more than offset by volume and mix. Margins were down 230 basis points in the quarter.","On energy management, the business continues to be a work in progress. We made a lot of gains in restructuring and resizing the business around its cost structure and footprint, were offset by sales softness in marine startup execution. Orders were $2.2 billion. That was down 1%. Digital energy was up 20% on a large domestic meter order, and Industrial Solutions was up 1%. This was offset by power conversion down 16%, with no repeat of first quarter \u201813 Brazilian drillship orders we took.","The business did continue to build backlog in all its segments, with a total up 17% year-over-year to $4.9 billion. Revenue was down 4% in the quarter, with digital energy down 20%, industrial solutions down 3%, and power conversion down 2%. Operating profit was $5 million in the quarter. That\u2019s down from $15 million a year ago. Despite the poor performance, we continue to get restructuring benefits and reduce SG&A cost. This was more than offset by negative volume and execution challenges. We expect this business to improve its results throughout the year, particularly in the second half.","Appliances and Lighting; Appliances and Lighting had a challenging quarter as well. Appliance revenues were down 3%. The appliance market was down 4% through February, but was much stronger in March to end the quarter flat year-over-year. Housing stock stats were soft, with single family down 8%, offset by multi-family strength, up 9%. Lighting revenue was down 4%. Our traditional channels in lighting were down 9%, partially offset by LED growth, up 33%. Segment profit of $53 million was down 33% in the quarter. Appliance op profit was down 2%, with higher price offset by lower volume and negative productivity. And lighting op profit was down 44%, driven by strong material depletion, more than offset by productivity price and foreign exchange. For both businesses, the last two weeks of March and the first week of April were much stronger. We expect them to be back on track in the second quarter. ","Next I\u2019ll cover GE Capital. Revenue of $10.5 billion was down 8%, primarily from non-repeat of the 30 Rock sale last year. Assets were down 3% or $18 Billion year-over-year. Net income of $1.9 billion was flat to prior year, as lower losses and impairments offset reduced gains, lower earning assets and tax benefits. ","ENI ended the quarter at $374 billion. It was down $28 billion or 7% from last year, and down $7 billion sequentially. Noncore ENI was down 16% to $52 billion versus last year. ","Net interest margins decreased 11 basis points from 2013 to 4.9%. This slight improvement in business margins was offset by the cost from carrying higher levels of cash.","GE Capital\u2019s liquidity and capital levels continued to get stronger. We ended the quarter with $75 billion of cash and reduced our commercial paper borrowings to $25 billion in the first quarter. That\u2019s nine months ahead of our year-end target. Our Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel 1 basis improved 23 basis points sequentially, with 32 basis points year-over-year to end at 11.4%. On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue to be stable. ","I\u2019ll walk through the segment performances. The commercial lending and leasing business ended the quarter with $175 billion of assets, flat to last year. On book core volume was $8 billion dollars, down 2% as we continued to stay disciplined on pricing and risk hurdles, with continued excess liquidity in the market. New business returns remained reasonably strong at about 1.8% ROI. Earnings of $564 million were up 42% as a result of not repeating the specific impairment we had last year in the first quarter as well as from asset sales. ","The consumer segment ended the quarter with $132 billion of assets, down 3% from last year. But we were up 8% in North American retail finance business. Earnings of $786 million were up 47% as a result of not repeating $300 million impact from the reserve modeling changes we implemented in the first quarter of 2013. ","North American Retail Finance earned $590 million in the quarter. That\u2019s up 54%, again largely driven by not repeating the reserving changes and on strong asset quotes of 8% year over year.","Real Estate had another solid quarter. Assets at $38 billion went down 11% versus prior year and $1 billion dollar sequentially. The equity book is down 29% from a year ago to $13 billion. Net income of $239 million was down 65%, primarily from not repeating the 30 Rock gain. In the current quarter, we sold 165 properties with a book value of $1 billion for about $117 million in gains. The debt business earned $120 million in the quarter and originated almost $2 billion of volume at attractive ROIs.","In terms of verticals, GECAS earned $352 million up 1% as higher core income offset the impact of lower assets which were down 8%. New volume was $1.5 billion, 36% higher year-over-year with very attractive returns north of 3% ROI\u2019s. We ended the quarter with zero aircraft on the ground.","EFS had a solid quarter, with earnings up 84% to $153 million driven by strong core income in gains, partially offset by impairments. The team continues to perform well here. As we look forward to the second quarter, we expect to run rate for GE Capital to be around $1.8 billion of earnings.","So with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Jeff. ","Jeffery Immelt","Great, Jeff. Thanks. Finally on the framework; look, we\u2019re reaffirming the framework for the year. We feel good really about our progress on the industrial side and we think -- which you saw in the first quarter in terms of organic growth. Solid organic growth and good margin expansion should continue in the second quarter and throughout the year. Capital is on track for its plan and CFOA remains on track as well with the framework. There is a lot going on in corporate and you understand our goals for restructuring. We\u2019ll give you frequent updates on our progress. And look, with underlying EPS up 9% in the quarter and strong industrial segment profit growth, we think we\u2019re off to a good start. ","So Matt let me turn it back over to you and let\u2019s take some questions. ","Matthew Cribbins","Thanks, Jeff, Jeff and Rod, Ellen why don\u2019t we open it up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our first question is from Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi, good morning, guys. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Scott.","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","The 8% core growth is a pretty big number. How do you think about the sustainability of those levels? It's probably about 2x the sector overall. And then I want ask a follow-up on margins. But let's just talk about core growth first.","Jeffrey Immelt","Jeff, you want to start?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yeah, Listen I think we\u2019re very happy with the level of growth in the quarter. Reflects a lot of the order activity we had in 2013. As we said the short cycle businesses were definitely impacted by weather in the first quarter. We expect Industrial Solutions, Appliances and Lighting to get better as we move in the second quarter in the year. We\u2019re still on framework. We expect organic growth for the year to be between 4% and 7% and I think we\u2019re pleased that we are off to a strong start here. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Scott I would just add, I think wind always adds a little bit of noise plus or minus around each quarter. It was more on the plus side this quarter. And like I said at the outlook meeting in December, we have an internal plan that adds up to more than the range and that\u2019s how we run the businesses and that\u2019s -- I think we still believe in the framework for the year. But we have an internal plan that adds up to more than that. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, fair enough. 50 bps of margins, just back of the envelope, 8% core growth should kind of get you there already. But you also talked about having value gap and cost-out. Is there any way to parse out the 50 bps and how you guys think about it via fixed-cost coverage from the volume leverage and the cost-out, how (indiscernible) break down to the 50 bps? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Mix was a bit of a head win for us in the quarter, more than 100 basis points in the quarter. That\u2019s the strength and wind, the strength you heard Rod talk about with 37% sales growth in Subsea while MNC volume was down 7%. Mix for us in the quarter was about 100 or 120 basis points of headwind. And that was offset with strong value gap, a little bit of favorability in R&D, but principally by simplification. We had 160 basis points of favorability and structural cost and getting at delivering on both the structural cost initiative and delivering on the restructuring investments we\u2019ve made. And that was partially offset by base cost inflation that generally reflects increases in salaries. I think we feel very good about the construct in the quarter. It\u2019s more or less how we thought about the year and what we described to you at yearend. We know that we are going to grow equipment and revenue faster than services this year. And so mix will be an item for the year. We have to deliver on simplification, overcome that and grow margins. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","That's helpful. Just a quick clarification, guys. I haven't heard you mention 8 series turbine in a long time. Do you actually have a commercially viable product at this point? ","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah. I think Scott this is \u2013 we\u2019ve gotten a couple of commitments and we\u2019re in the process of rolling that out as we speak. We think this is going to be a great product at really a good time. ","Scott Davis \u2013 Barclays Capital","Perfect. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Deane Dray with Citi research","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Jeff, I was hoping you could expand on your comments on the bolt-on acquisition outlook. You all have been operating on a self-imposed investor-friendly range of -- it was $1 billion to $3 billion and then got inched up for Avio, $1 billion to $4 billion. And you are clearly signaling a willingness to go a bit higher than that for the right acquisition. That's the same language you used when you -- just before you got Avio. So maybe you could expand for us; how much higher above $4 billion? What applications or markets look interesting? It likely sounds like you've got something close. ","Jeffrey Immelt","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it, Dean other than this is the way we answer the question typically from the standpoint of, we do the vast majority of our acquisitions in that range. People ask if you saw something that was strategic added to the growth rate, bolt-on, well priced secretive. Would you go above that? And clearly when we did Avio that was $4.2 billion and we had one to three type of range. It\u2019s typically the way we answer the question in investor meetings and at the outlook meetings and things like that. Again I think we have discipline on capital allocation. We\u2019re committed to dividend growth, the buyback that we talked about, but if we saw unique value in the marketplace like we did with Avio, we would do transactions like that. ","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Great. That makes lots of sense. And then since we have Rod on the call today, I would love to hear from you about -- if you could frame for us how much of the portfolio you have in place today. The whole idea that GE was able to take a lot of the proceeds from NBC and very quickly add some strategic assets into Oil & Gas and then you would stop and see how is the portfolio? Where are the gaps? From your perspective, how much of your portfolio do you have today in order to be effective? Are you half? Do you have three-quarters? I\u2019m not asking you specific gaps, but maybe just frame for us how complete the portfolio is.","Rod Christie","Sure. I think when I look at the portfolio that we had today for Subsea, we feel very good about it. We can compete pretty much anywhere that we choose to. I think what you\u2019ve seen over the last six months around us moving more into the Subsea power and processing really gives you an idea of the brands that we can bring from GE broadly. So our conversion, total machinery, water, realize it\u2019s a step into those spaces. So at this point in time, I feel very good about where we are and anything going forward is really a discussion about internal versus external with a bit more scale. So it\u2019s really about timing. So very similar to what Jeff had talked about with if we see something that looks very attractive to us then potentially, but we don\u2019t feel like there\u2019s any major method in this point in time.","Deane Dray \u2013 Citigroup","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Hey, good morning?","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Steve. How are you doing? ","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Good. Can you maybe just talk about -- you talked about the 50 bps continuing throughout the year. Anything you guys have -- I guess every company has become kind of seasonal with bigger quarters in the back half of the year. Anything lumpy in the second quarter that we need to be aware of, whether it's timing of some of these Advanced Gas Path stuff or Wind that we have to consider when thinking about the second quarter? ","Jeffrey Immelt","I don\u2019t think so, Steve. I don\u2019t think Jeff said he was carrying the 50 basis points all year, but thank you for that. We\u2019ll have slightly higher restructuring charges in the second quarter. I said we\u2019re still on track for the 1 to 1.5 and we\u2019re going to spend 60% of that spend on the first half of the year. So the second quarter will be a little bit bigger than the first quarter. We will ship more GEnx engines in the second quarter than we shipped in the first quarter. But other than that, not a lot of -- I did mention that we\u2019re working on one disposition. Not sure whether that\u2019s going to be second or third quarter quite yet, but it\u2019s not that a big a deal. Other than that I don\u2019t have a lot of other items to call out for.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. And then just on the organic growth calc, can we get the contribution from the deals and then ForEx, or negative from ForEx for the quarter, total deals, revenue contribution, and then ForEx? I know they are in the back of the supplement or whatever, or in the press release, but just the data.","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yeah. Sure, Steve. Reported revenue, up 8%. Acquisitions added 2 points. Dispositions had a 1.4 point impact, but then foreign exchange was half a point and that\u2019s how you go from 8 to 8.","Steve Tusa \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay. All right. That's great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.","Jeff Sprague \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey Jeff. How you doing?","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","I\u2019m doing great, and you?","Jeffrey Immelt","Good.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Just a question on the industrial balance sheet, I guess dovetailing with maybe opening the aperture a little bit on deals. You did do the $3 billion debt raise on the industrial balance sheet. How would you size that relative to the capacity that you have? You teased us a little bit in December with some juice there. Is $3 billion the number or is it something larger than that?","Jeffrey Bornstein","The $3 billion was in the context of the capital allocation plan that we put together for 2014. And we saw the first quarter where markets was very opportunistic. We issued the $3 billion. We were immensely oversubscribed and we\u2019re very pleased with the rates that we took the $3 billion at, well inside on after tax basis our dividend yield. That\u2019s how we size it within the context of our capital allocation game plan for the year. We\u2019re constantly reevaluating the capital allocation game plan with the team and the board, and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","But that\u2019s roughly the comfortable number relative to the cost commitments to capital and everything?","Jeffrey Bornstein","No. It's the relevant comfortable number within the context of the capital allocation plan we pulled together for the year.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Okay. And then, can you just size for us the gains that you have in CLL and energy financial services?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yeah. So, CLL we did sell about 18,000 boxcars per diems, meaning daily rental boxcars in the quarter that was worth a little north of $100 million. We did sell some private equity investments that we do reasonably routinely and just a little bit of Volcker driven the first quarter. That was a much smaller gain. And then energy finance, it's pretty routine for us. We had about, I don\u2019t know, $150 million of gains associated with properties that we sold in energy finance in the first quarter.","Jeff Sprague - Vertical Research","Right, thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Thank you. Good morning everybody.","Jeffrey Immelt","Hey John.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Good morning guys. Jeff, could we flesh out a little bit of the playbook for energy, the energy management business? It looks like you guys made a leadership change there. How are you thinking about really just the portfolio? And maybe Jeff Bornstein you\u2019ve gotten into further the restructuring, how that kind of maybe compliments that segment or your focus on it, just something that might provide us a little bit more color.","Jeffrey Immelt","John, here\u2019s the way I look at it. First from a technical standpoint, there are pieces of the energy management business that are great fits for the rest of the company, like power conversion. As Rod said, that\u2019s a great complement to oil and gas, and some of the things we\u2019re doing. So technically these are industries we understand and can compete in. Our relevant competitors have margin rates that are 10% plus. Some of that\u2019s scale, and some of that\u2019s our own complexity. ","What Jeff Bornstein said today is that we\u2019re committed to restructure, and that\u2019s going to provide some big margin lift in that business. And then I just think we can execute better, Mark Begor is a guy that\u2019s well known inside the company of being a great recruiter and an extremely experienced operator, turn around guy and he is in place, and we\u2019re hiring people from the industry. My intent is to run this business and make it better and make it accretive to investors and drive earnings in it.","Could there be a couple of segments in there that had long term fits for GE? Could be. We\u2019ll sort that out and be very tough minded about it, but this segment can do better than what you\u2019re seeing right now. And that\u2019s our commitment to you, is to make it better both from a cost standpoint, and from a market standpoint. ","Jeffrey Bornstein","So just on that front, I\u2019d just add that they actually -- you can't see it in the results yet. It's getting eaten up in operations, but we are making progress in restructuring. We had close to a $25 million of benefits in restructuring in the first quarter, and we expect that to accelerate throughout the year. There is some progress here. Our manufacturing delinquencies are down 50% versus yearend and so, we are making progress. I understand -- completely understand you can't see it in the results yet, but our expectations are this business is going to improve dramatically from an operating earnings perspective over the balance of the year.","John Inch - Deutsche Bank","Okay. That was my other part of the question here. So sequential improvement and it sounds like Jeff Immelt, there\u2019s no reason this business can't be running at double digit margins. Is that fair?","Jeffrey Immelt","Look, everybody -- I think John everybody else, unlike our other businesses where our margins are ahead of our peers, this is one where we trail our peers and we can do better. ","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Can I just ask about the Oil & Gas business for a second? There\u2019s a broad level of concern in the industry about flattish CapEx budgets for the integrateds and obviously just the global economy is still not particularly helpful. Price of oil doesn't seem to be going anywhere. Maybe you can provide a little bit more color, given that you featured Oil & Gas on the call. How does that context of these big integrated companies with flat if not even maybe declining CapEx budgets, how does that dovetail with your own business and why is your own business either more or less impervious to that?","Jeffrey Immelt","Rod, why don\u2019t you take a crack? ","Rod Christie","Sure. I think -- and I\u2019m going to talk specifically about what I\u2019m seeing in Subsea today. Really what I see is a lot more frontend engagement. So customers aren\u2019t -- the customers that I\u2019m talking to aren\u2019t really looking at dialing back the number of projects. They\u2019re looking at how do they get better capital efficiency. So we\u2019ve seen more frontend engagement around technology, the selection of that technology configuration and how can we deploy with less risks, shorter cycle and potentially at a lower cost. So in many cases what I thought about with the structuring our product really played to that. We\u2019ve taken cycle out, which obviously means a shorter carrying period for any capital investment in the Subsea area from my perspective. So I think most of the customers are looking to continue to drive as many of the projects as they can. It\u2019s making it much easier for us from our point of view of actually early engagement, early dialogue, early engineering so we can take more risk out. ","Jeffrey Immelt","John, can I -- I\u2019d add to that. The reinforcement of the way we build our oil and gas business by really invest very specific segments that have faster growth rates than the industry itself. Things like Subsea, turbo machinery and the LNG train, some of our downstream technologies. We really are in the places where there\u2019s going to be a lot of capital continue to be spent. ","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Okay. So looking at Shell's CapEx deployment is not really the correct proxy, in other words, is what you are saying?","Jeffrey Immelt","Exactly, yeah.","John Inch \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchel with the Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","I just had a couple of questions on the margin bridge. I think, firstly, value gap was maybe what, about a $100 million tailwind in Q1? Just wanted to check that. And back in January you had talked about a $200 million tailwind for the year in value gap. Is that still the case or have you updated those assumptions?","Jeffrey Bornstein","No. I think that\u2019s what we guided at yearend, that we expected the value gap for the year to be $100 million to $200 million. In the quarter you\u2019re not too far off the mark here in terms of value gap. I think what you\u2019ve got to bear in mind is within our value gap this quarter power and water was negative, but not extraordinarily negative. And we expect price, particularly in thermal to be much tougher as we work through the backlog for the balance of the year. So you\u2019re correct. The framework was up to $200 million and you\u2019re not far off the mark on the impact in the quarter. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay. And then just on the mix effect, can you just remind us, I guess, what the view is now on wind deliveries for the year and how much more those are ramping up in the back half? ","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yeah. So, no change on the framework that I gave you at yearend on wind deliveries. I said that we\u2019d do about 3,000 units and that\u2019s still what we expect to do. In terms of first half, second half, it\u2019s a little bit heavier weighted to the second half of the year. We\u2019ll do I don\u2019t know about 1,800 of those 3,000 in the third and fourth quarter. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Lastly just quickly, and I guess for Jeff Immelt. On the divestments in Industrial, you talked a little bit about that in the slides. Also in the annual report there was some kind of a commitment or comment around targeting a minimum 10% margin for the Industrial businesses. I just wondered what -- was that equipment plus service combined, and what the timeframe for that 10% minimum threshold was? Because I guess you have some businesses that have never been at 10%.","Jeffery Immelt","I think Julian, what I would focus on is the $4 billion number. I think it\u2019s our expectation that -- we\u2019re more active on the divestiture front this year and try to leave it at that. We continue to be tough minded around the portfolio and I would expect our divestures to be a little bit more active this year than they were last. ","Julian Mitchell \u2013 Credit Suisse","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Just, Rod, while I've got you here -- and I really appreciate the focus in on the business unit during the call. I guess one of the primary debates around Subsea is that production tree order trend starting to rise again in 2015. You addressed your mixed benefit. But this emerging capital discipline by the majors I guess is a real question of even in those more attractive sub segments, to what extent do you think that risks the growth and to what extent also are you seeing the outlook for production tree pricing deteriorate in any way?","Rod Christie","If you look at the forecast this year for trees overall globally it\u2019s down, but you have to look at the mix between Brazil and the rest of the world. Brazil is a large buy for a large commitment made for trees in 2013. The rest of the world demand actually increases slightly year-over-year and then you see the total demand back up again or forecast to go back up again in \u201815. But the other thing that you really see is the projects have got larger, so things have got lumpier. You look at the total number of projects that are going for development into the future, there\u2019s less projects but more tree count per project. So I think again the early engagement pre-feed activities and feed activities are really going to be critical to driving some of the efficiency in this area from capital deployment.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Okay. And the pricing, outlook for pricing?","Jeffrey Bornstein","I think we still feel that pricing -- the demand for the future is still increasing. So it\u2019s really about delivery cycle at this point in time.","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Okay. On Healthcare, the pricing in Healthcare. I guess, Jeff, how should we think about this? Do you see this as any kind of structural change in the industry? Is this a function in the Americas, in North America, of the transition we\u2019re all going through in hospitals? And can you maybe give us some color on how we should think about this? ","Jeffrey Immelt ","Steve, I think that\u2019s a good question. I\u2019d say first, if you look outside the U.S, the markets are all normal with Europe bouncing back and the growth markets still pretty strong. I think it\u2019s too soon to say on just the impact of the Affordable Care Act. There\u2019s just so damn much going on in the U.S healthcare market right now. We\u2019re thinking about the next couple of years as being flood to up slightly. So, we are not really thinking much about robust growth and more industry consolidation of hospital systems, more integration between insurers and hospitals. So there\u2019s just a ton going on in the industry. At the same time when you launch a new product like the Revolution CT like we\u2019re launching in the second quarter, it\u2019s going to build a huge backlog. It\u2019s going to have positive growth. And so with all the stuff that\u2019s going on in the industry, when you have new technology, you still can differentiate yourself and you still get good growth and good margins. I think we\u2019re just wait and see and watch how the industry evolves. ","Steven Winoker \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Company","Okay. And I can I just sneak one in for Jeff Bornstein? Or maybe it\u2019s two, I suppose. But this tax rate that we got this quarter, should we think about that us more normalized now? And also were the orders -- have those Algerian orders come through yet in the official order numbers?","Jeffrey Bornstein","Yes. The tax rate -- I think what I said was we still expect the industrials tax rate to be about 20% and we still expect the GE Capital tax rate to be single digits in the year. I don\u2019t think our view of taxes has changed at all for the total year. The Algerian units and the mega deal are in our orders book. ","Jeffrey Immelt ","But I think, Steve, if you look at heavy duty gas turbine orders, I think we said in December what, 125 or something like that. I think we are tracking at least to that. This is a slightly improving market is what I would say, broadly speaking. ","Jeffrey Bornstein","I want to clear up one thing before we move on to the next question. On energy financing I think Jeff Sprague asked me on gains and energy finance. I think I said 150. It was 120. That\u2019s about 60 higher year over year. That was partly offset by about $100 million of increased higher requirements this year versus last year so I just wanted to make sure that was clear.","Matthew Cribbins","We know everyone has a busy morning. Ellen, why don\u2019t we take one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Nigel Cole with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks. Good morning and thanks for fitting me in. Jeff, you mentioned the H frame, which is obviously a very important product. You mentioned two commitments. Were they US commitments? And then dovetailing on the back of your comments about a gradually improving market, what are you seeing in the US right now in terms of the front-log for 2015 and 2016?","Jeffrey Immelt"," The answer I think to the first question is, No and the answer to the second question I think is just slow improvement in the US, starting with Peakers. We haven\u2019t seen big demand for base load units yet but a ton more interest in the US than we\u2019ve seen in the last few years. That\u2019s the way I would describe it Nigel.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Okay, great. Moving on to GECAS, assets are down by about 10% from early last year. And I\u2019m wondering; what do you think is the right level for assets in GECAS? Is there a longer tail of decapitalization within GECAS going forward?","Jeffrey Bornstein","The GECAS business order magnitude is roughly the size over to the context of GE capital and company but it\u2019s probably going to be long-term, plus or minus. They\u2019ll continue to originate, they\u2019ll continue to grow. I talked about their volume in the first quarter being very strong year over year at very attractive returns so they\u2019ll continue to be very active and write new business. At the same time they\u2019ll continue to prune the portfolio they have and that allows them, it creates the capacity for them to continue to be in the market and right volume. Assets year over year I think were flat for GECAS so\u2026 ","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","I think they\u2019re down 8% year over year but I can check that. Then just, Jeff, on the -- you mentioned $1.8 billion run rate for GE Capital for the quarter going forward. That is actually slightly above the $7 billion placeholder for the year. Do you think there is more of an upside bias to that $7 billion at this stage?","Jeffrey Bornstein","No. I think we\u2019re still kind of in that $7 billion framework. Given the number of items to go here, we\u2019re still planning on doing the initial IPO of retail so you lose 20% of those earnings. We\u2019ll still continue to invest in that business to create the stand along capability around risk and governance. That will come at some cost. We\u2019ll still do the GECAS, iron fervency are in the third quarter. I think that we\u2019re still focused on the $7 billion framework that Keith shared with you in November.","Nigel Coe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Immelt","Great. Thanks, thanks everybody.","Matthew Cribbins","Thank you. The replay of today\u2019s webcast will be available this afternoon on our website.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the program over to your host for today's conference, Matt Cribbins, Vice President of Investor Communications. Please proceed.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. We issued the press release, presentation, and supplemental earlier this morning on our website at www.ge.com\/investor. As always, elements of this presentation are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today. Please interpret them in that light.","For today's webcast we have our Chairman and CEO, Jeff Immelt; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Jeff Bornstein.","Now I'll turn it over to Jeff Immelt.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Matt.","The team had a strong quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment. We're executing both organic growth and cost initiatives. Specifically, Industrial EPS grew by 18% and earnings at the combination of Industrial and the Capital Verticals, which is the way we think about GE going forward, grew by 19%. Organic growth and earnings performance was very strong. Orders were up 13%, revenue was up 5% and profit would have grown by 11% organically. Our operations were strong. Margins expanded by 70 basis points with gross margins up 60 basis points and Industrial CFOA grew by 79%.","Our Oil & Gas business met expectations for the quarter for orders, revenue and profit. Organic profit was up 5%, and we continue to grow margins despite a tougher environment. We end the half with our goals on track. Meanwhile, we have a number of portfolio actions underway. GE Capital asset sales were robust, and we will achieve $100 billion of deals closed in 2015. We still expect the Synchrony split to take place by the end of this year. Appliances and Alstom are in the middle of regulatory reviews, but we still expect both deals to close by the end of the year. We remain committed to doing good deals for investors.","In all, we're confident enough in our performance to raise the low end of our range for our Industrial guidance to $1.13 to $1.20 EPS. So overall, we had a very good quarter. Orders were very strong, up 8%, or 13% organically. We saw solid growth in both equipment and service. Orders pricing was up slightly, and we grew backlog to a record $272 billion. Power & Water was up 22%, behind strengthed power gen products and wind. We now have won 61 technical selections for the H turbine, up eight in the quarter.","Oil & Gas has solid equipment orders in turbo machinery and downstream, consistent with expectations. Power conversion orders grew by 33% as we're winning big in renewable energy markets. Aviation had large orders growth in LEAP and GEnx, and meanwhile, spares' order rates grew by 33%. Healthcare HCS Equipment orders grew by 6% in the U.S. as that market continues to rebound. The U.S. was particularly strong, but we also saw growth in many parts of the world. The U.S. was up 10%, Europe up 4% and growth markets up 2%.","First half Industrial Internet orders were $1.9 billion, up 83%, and we expect total software and solution orders for the year of $6 billion, up 30%. Service growth was robust at 7% ex-FX, and backlog reached $200 billion for the first time. Our strong backlog in orders position GE to achieve our long-term organic growth targets of 5%. Organic revenue was up 5%, growth was broad based with six of seven segments up. A real highlight was the $19 billion of commitments at the Paris Air Show. For the first half, U.S. revenue grew by 3%, and four of nine growth markets were up, and China grew by 12%.","We had some excellent performances in service. Power gen service was up 9%, Aviation service was up 6%, and Transportation service was up 6%. We're gaining share in Healthcare with U.S. Healthcare HCS Equipment revenue growing 16%. We closed a big Healthcare deal in Kenya worth more than $200 million, and international locos grew by 128% with big wins in Brazil and South Africa. A few adjacencies were particularly strong. Wind grew by 49% and LEDs grew by 77%. And our Power Conversion business is innovating in solar and wind energy, recording $300 million in orders in those markets alone.","We have a strong pipeline of products and services that are winning versus competition. And we're having success in software and analytics. We launched GE's Digital Wind Farm providing customers with up to 20% more capacity. We announced a major collaboration with BP for asset monitoring in oil and gas, and we closed another Class 1 railroad that we utilized GEs Movement Planner, in a deal worth more than $100 million. Margins expanded with 70 basis points of growth. Gross margins were up 60 basis points with strength in value gap and productivity. We're making progress broadly with five of seven segments having margin growth. Simplification continues to deliver results, and our SG&A targets are on track.","First half margins are up 100 basis points, and service margins were particularly strong up 130 basis points year-to-date as the impact of our analytical tools are being felt. Equipment margins meanwhile were up 30 basis points year-to-date. So we're running the company well. Cash is a good story. Industrial CFOA is up 79% year-to-date, and free cash flow is up 54%. We did not receive a Capital dividend in the quarter, but we're hopeful to get an additional dividend to the parent in the year.","As we've said, our asset sales are ahead of plan, and GE Capital has substantial strength to remain safe and secure. We expect to complete the Synchrony split by the end of 2015, and at the current stock price our share of Synchrony is worth about $24 billion. The balance sheet is very strong with $17 billion of cash at the parent, and our cash generation is on track for the year. And we remain committed to our capital allocation plans.","Now, over to Jeff to review the businesses.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Jeff.","I'll start with the second quarter summary. We had revenues of $32.8 billion, which were up 2% in the quarter. Industrial revenues including corporate were up 1% to $26.9 billion. You can see on the right that the Industrial segments were flat on revenue for the quarter, but up 5% organically. Industrial operating plus Verticals EPS was $0.31, which was up 19% year-over-year, that's driven by Industrial up 18%, and the Verticals up 25%. The operating EPS number of","$0.28 adds another continuing GE Capital activity including the Consumer segment, headquarter run-off and other exit related items which I'll cover in more detail shortly.","Continuing EPS of $0.24 includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net EPS of negative $0.13 includes the impact of discontinued operations. The total DiscOps impact in the quarter was negative $3.7 billion, which included a $4.3 billion non-cash charge related to moving the majority of our GE Capital CLL business to held for sale. We disclosed this earlier in the month. Partly offsetting the charge was income associated with CLL and real estate. This charge was included in the total $23 billion GE Capital estimated exit impact that we communicated in April, but earlier than we originally planned, based on accelerated sales activity.","As Jeff said, we had a strong performance on cash, with CFOA for the half up $3.9 billion or 17%. Industrial CFOA was $3.5 billion at the half, which was up 79%. In the first quarter we had $450 million of GE Capital dividends, and we did not receive a dividend from GE Capital in the second quarter. The consolidated tax rate for the quarter was 27%. The GE rate was 21%, in line with guidance we provided. The GE Capital reported rate was 45% driven by tax charges associated with the exit plan, and the vertical tax rate in the quarter was 6%.","On the right side, you can see the segment results. As I mentioned earlier, Industrial segment revenues were flat on a reported basis, but up 5% organically, reflecting 5 points of headwind from foreign exchange. Foreign exchange was $1.3 billion drag on Industrial segment revenue, and about a $215 million impact on Industrial segment's op profit. Despite this headwind, Industrial segment operating profit was up 5%, and organically, the Industrial segments were up 11%. GE Capital Vertical earnings of $531 million in the quarter were up 19%.","Before we get into the traditional pages, I wanted to first walk the different elements of our earnings for the quarter, so the dynamics are clear given all the moving pieces of GE Capital. Starting with the first column on the left and working down, Industrial operating income was $2.6 billion, and Verticals income was $0.5 billion, for a total Industrial plus Verticals operating earnings of $3.2 billion. The GE Capital Consumer segment earned $459 million during the quarter, which is comprised of $463 million from Synchrony, offset by our non-strategic global consumer portfolio. We incurred $772 million of costs, driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter runoff, operating expenses, excess interest, and preferred dividends in the quarter. As a result, total operating earnings were $2.8 billion.","Including non-operating pension costs, continuing earnings were $2.4 billion. In discontinued operations, you can see the $4.3 billion held-for-sale charge for CLL, as well as the impact of CLL real estate earnings in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, net earnings for the quarter were a negative $1.4 billion. In the center and far right columns, you can see the associated EPS impacts and their variance versus prior year.","Next on Industrial other items in the quarter, we had $0.03 of charges related to ongoing Industrial restructuring and other items, as we continue to drive the cost competitiveness of the company. Charges were about $400 million on a pre-tax basis and $280 million after tax. About 40% of that related to restructuring Oil & Gas, as we continue to execute on an aggressive cost-out program in that business. We also had $0.03 of gains in the quarter, primarily related to the NBCU settlement that we disclosed in June. We also had a small gain related to a disposition in Oil & Gas. Both of these transactions were booked in corporate.","On a pre-tax basis, gains and settlements totaled about $500 million, but given the high tax rate on these transactions, the after-tax impact was $295 million in the quarter. As you're aware, we are expecting gains in the second half from the appliances and signaling transactions. We expect gains and restructuring to be balanced on an EPS basis for the year. We've increased our expected restructuring from about $0.09 to about $0.12 due to the higher gains we expect in the year and additional attractive restructuring opportunities we see.","Now, I'll go through the segments, starting with Power & Water. Orders of $7.8 billion were up 22% in the quarter, up 27% ex-foreign exchange. Equipment orders were higher by 29%, with distributed power up 68%, thermal was up 25%, and renewables higher by 24%. Distributed power was driven by domestic orders for LMS100 units from two customers. Reciprocating engines for gas compression remain weak and were lower by 37%.","In thermal, we booked 18 gas turbines versus 10 last year, including an H turbine in Korea. This brings our H units to 17 in backlog and an additional 44 technical wins. Renewables orders totaled 888 wind turbines versus 715 a year ago. Our two new NPI products, the 2.0-megawatt and the 2.3-megawatt platforms, received additional orders for 200 units in the second quarter of this year. We also launched the Digital Wind Farm software solution, featuring a new 2-megawatt modular turbine connected to the Industrial Internet and built on our Predix platform. This application will drive up to 20% more annual energy production for our customers.","Service orders were up 17% on strong PGS growth in ASEAN and the Middle East-North Africa, and AGP orders were 39 versus 19 last year. Revenues in the quarter were higher by 8%. Revenues were higher by 15% organically. Equipment revenues were up 10%, driven by renewables up 53% on shipments of 806 wind turbines versus 510 last year, partially offset by distributed power down 20% on lower turbine and engine shipments, and thermal down 3%. We shipped 24 gas turbines, three higher than the second quarter of last year, but with reduced scope and a mix of more 7Fs than 9Fs. Service revenues were up 6%, with PGS up 9% on higher installations, strong upgrades, including AGP sales of 26 versus 19 last year.","Operating profit in the quarter was up 8% reported and up 14% organically. Growth was driven by volume, price, and base cost productivity more than offsetting H turbine ramp cost, negative mix driven by wind and distributed power, and foreign exchange. Operating margins in the quarter were flat at 18%. The framework for Power & Water remains intact. We expect 100 to 105 gas turbine orders in shipment, 3,000 to 3,200 wind shipments, and AGP upgrades of 90 to 100. Distributed power we think will remain challenging for the year.","Next on Oil & Gas, the business performed as we expected in the second quarter on orders and revenue. It performed slightly better than we expected on operating profit. I'll start with orders. Orders were down 20% reported and down 11% organically. Equipment orders were down 14% and flat organically. Turbo machinery was higher by 40%, driven by new LNG orders, and downstream was higher by 53% from strength in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. The strength in turbo machinery and downstream were offset by subsea, which was down 48% on tough comparisons, and surface was down 31% on weak North American demand.","Service orders in the quarter were down 26% and down 20% organically. Turbo machinery and subsea were down 36% and 30% respectively. M&C was down 22%, principally driven by the Wayne disposition and a softer market. Downstream was up 23%. Revenues of just under $4.1 billion were down 15% reported and down 4% organically, driven by foreign exchange and the Wayne disposition. Equipment revenues were down 20% reported, down 8% organically, principally driven by turbo machinery down 20% or 7% organically, and surface down 24%. M&C was stronger by 10% organically, and service revenues were down 9% but up 1% organically.","Operating profit was down 12% to $583 million in the quarter, but was up 5% versus last year organically. Foreign exchange translation was a $115 million headwind in the quarter. Margins grew 40 basis points and were up 140 basis points organically. The business executed well, delivering on manufacturing productivity, positive value gap and executed restructuring.","Through the first half, Oil & Gas revenues were down 12% reported and down 2% organically. Operating profit was down 9% reported, but was up 8% organically. Margins improved 40 basis points reported and 120 basis points organically for the half. The business team is ahead of their plan to take out $600 million of costs this year. The framework we laid out for you at EPG of operating profit down 5% to 10% reported and down 0% to 5% organically is unchanged.","Next up is Aviation. Global air travel continues to grow robustly. Passenger traffic grew 6.3% year-to-date through May, with strength in both domestic and international travel. Most regions saw strength, and air freight volumes grew 4% year-to-date. Aviation had very strong orders performance in the second quarter with $7.6 billion of orders up 30%. Equipment orders grew 37% to $4 billion driven by commercial engine orders growth of 71%. GE90 and GE9X orders of $2 billion were higher by 12 times, with key orders from United, Korean Air, Qatar and ANA.","GEnx orders were higher by three times. Commercial engine backlog grew 43% in the quarter to $29 billion. Military government orders were down 31%, more or less as expected. Service orders were up 23%, with commercial spares up strongly at 33% or $37.9 million a day, and military service orders were up 73%. Services backlog ended at $107 billion, up 7%. Revenues in the quarter of $6.3 billion were up 3%, with commercial equipment higher by 7%. The business shipped 86 GEnx engines versus 75 a year ago, which includes 15 units delay from the first quarter. Military equipment was lower by 12%. Service revenue was up 6% and commercial spare parts higher by 30%, and military was higher by 15%. That was partially offset by lower commercial time-and-material shop visits.","Operating profit was 6% higher than the second quarter of 2014 driven by strong value gap and base cost productivity. Margins expanded 60 basis points in the quarter. The Aviation team continues to deliver operationally and win commercially as they execute on multiple new product introductions. At this year's Paris Air Show we announced $19 billion of orders and commitments. LEAP testing and performance remains on track, and the first LEAP installed engines will go into service in mid 2016.","On Healthcare, orders of $4.7 billion were down 3%, but up 4% organically. Orders in the U.S grew 3%, Europe was down 13%, but up 7% organically. And Japan was up 12% organically with Africa higher by 40%. Offsetting these strong organic results were the Middle East down 6% driven by Saudi, and China down 7% on continued slow public tenders. In terms of business lines, Healthcare systems, orders were down 3% reported, but up 3% organically. U.S. imaging and ultrasound were up strongly at 8%, with MRI higher by 17%, and ultrasound up 7%. Japan was up 1% and up 19% ex the impact of the yen. Africa was up 42% on a large Minister of Health deal in Kenya. And China was soft, it was down 9% in the quarter.","Life science orders were down 2% reported, but up 7% organic, with bioprocess continuing to grow up 13% organically. Revenues in the quarter were down 3%, up 3% organically. Healthcare systems revenues were up 3% organic, and life sciences grew 8% organic. Operating profit was down 3% reported but up 2% ex-foreign exchange. Volume growth and productive was partially offset by foreign exchange and price. Margin rates were flat in the quarter. So the U.S. market continues to grow. Europe appears stable. We believe we continue to take share in most of the markets we operate in. China remains a challenge with slow tenders, but we do not think there is an underlying demand problem. We really like the outlook and the growth trajectory for the bio-process business within life science.","Next up is Transportation. Rail volumes were down 1.8% in the second quarter, with car loads down 7% driven by coal, petroleum, and agriculture, and that was partially offset by a 4.4% increase in intermodal traffic. Rail volumes for the half were essentially flat with last year. Transportation orders were down 5% in the quarter driven by lower equipment orders down 19%, partly offset by 6% growth in services. Locomotive orders in North America were lower by 99 units, partly offset by strong international orders. Service strength was driven by $115 million order for Movement Planner and our solutions software business, and very good spare parts demand. Backlog grew 32% year-over-year to $21 billion.","Revenues were up 9% principally driven by equipment growth of 13%, and services higher by 6%. We shipped 191 locomotives in the quarter versus 165 in the second quarter of 2014. Operating profit was up strongly at 23% driven by higher locomotive and parts volume, strong productivity, partly offset by mining mix and Tier 4 ramp costs. Margins improved in the quarter 260 basis points versus last year. We currently have 18 pre-production Tier 4 units in revenue service with customers, and we will begin shipping our first production units this month. The launch remains on track.","In Energy Management, orders were $2 billion in the quarter, up 5%. Orders were higher by 13% excluding the effects of FX. The business saw strength in power conversion, higher by 33%, partly offset by digital energy down 5%, and industrial solutions down 6%, but roughly flat organically. Strength in power conversion was driven by higher penetration of renewables market, where the business has grown its share 50% in the last year. This was partially offset by weakness in oil and gas related marine space. Backlog grew 10% to $5.5 billion in the quarter. Revenues of $1.8 billion were down 5%, but up 4% organically. Organically, power conversion was higher by 13%, digital energy up 2%, and industrial systems was down 2%.","Operating profit was up 19% versus last year, and up 40% organically. Growth was driven by strong productivity more than offsetting foreign exchange. Margins improved 90 basis points in the second quarter. Through the first half, Energy Management operating profit was up 49% reported and up 96% organically. Finally, with Appliances & Lighting, revenue was up 5% in the quarter with Appliances up 7% on strong volume and Lighting was up 2%. The U.S. appliance industry units were higher by 6%, with retail up 5% and contract up 12% on robust housing starts. And Lighting revenue growth was driven by LED which was up 77%, partially offset by a 17% decline in the traditional products. LED now accounts for 36% of Lighting revenue, up 15 points from last year. We believe we're on track for approximately $1 billion of LED revenue in 2015.","Operating profit was higher by 62% in the second quarter, driven by higher volume and strong productivity. As has been reported, the U.S. antitrust authorities have filed suit to challenge the sale of GE Appliances to Electrolux, and we plan to vigorously defend the transaction in court. We expect the trial to begin in the fourth quarter, and our goal remains to close this deal this year. We are confident the transaction is good for customers and consumers, and that acquiring the GE Appliances brand would help Electrolux compete in an increasingly global and intensely and competitive industry.","And finally, I'll cover GE Capital. As I discussed earlier, our Vertical businesses earned $531 million this quarter, up 19% from prior year on strong performances across Aviation, Energy and Healthcare. Portfolio quality is stable and GECAS finished the quarter with only one aircraft on the ground. The Verticals generated $2.2 billion of volume in the quarter, up 4%, and 80% of the GECAS volume and commitments were powered by GE's CFM equipment. Energy finance arranged deals in the quarter that will fund over 180 GE wind turbines.","Working down the page, Consumer earned $459 million during the quarter, down 3%, driven by Synchrony's minority interest. Our share of the Synchrony earnings was $463 million. In the quarter the Synchrony team filed for separation with the Federal Reserve, and we continue to target year-end, subject to regulatory approval. As in prior quarters, CEO Margaret Keane will host Synchrony's earnings call later today. Corporate generated $772 million charge in the quarter driven by exit related tax and restructuring charges, headquarter run-off operating expenses, excess interest, and our preferred dividend of $160 million in the quarter.","Discontinued operations ended the quarter with a $3.7 billion loss. Results were driven by our commercial lending and leasing business as the majority of that business was moved to discontinued operations in the second quarter, as you will have seen from our 8-K published in early July. As part of accelerating our timeline, we recognized $4.3 billion held-for-sale loss which includes the write-off of $8 billion of goodwill. This charge is included in the $23 billion total cost construct we shared with you in April. On an economic basis, we expect the CLL portfolios to generate a gain versus our tangible equity.","Other earnings from discontinued operations were $582 million for the quarter and are primarily driven by CLL operations. Overall, GE Capital reported a $3.5 billion loss, and we ended the quarter with $179 billion of ENI, excluding liquidity. That's down $124 billion from the prior quarter. Our liquidity levels remain strong, and we ended the quarter at $85 billion, including $14 billion attributable to Synchrony, and our Basel III Tier-1 common ratio was 11.4%. That's up 80 basis points from the first quarter. We expect this ratio to continue to improve as we dispose off risk-weighted assets.","In terms of portfolio sales, the team continues to make good progress. During the quarter we signed deals representing approximately $23 billion of ENI, bringing our year-to-date total to $68 billion. There continues to be strong interest in our portfolios, and we have $80 billion of additional ENI in the market currently. By year-end we are on track to close approximately $100 billion and sign between $120 billion and $150 billion in total. We expect to be largely complete with our exit plan by year-end 2016, a year earlier than our original plan that we shared with you in April.","At the bottom of the page is the 2015 dividend matrix we shared with you on April 10 when we announced the GE Capital exit. We are operating the business through the process at 14% Tier-1 common. As I discussed earlier, we ended the quarter at 11.4% Tier-1 common. We expect to improve the ratio to 14% or better by year-end as we close $100 billion of estimated deals. Overall, Keith and the GE Capital team delivered a strong operational quarter and remain focused on delivering on the portfolio transformation.","With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jeff.","We have a few adjustments to the 2015 operating framework. We're increasing the low end of the range with new expectations of $1.13 to $1.20. So far this year, organic growth and margin expansion are trending towards the high end of our expectations, and we expect this to continue. We're still planning for our transactions to close by the end of the year. The Verticals will remain on track for $0.15 EPS, and the accounting around Capital exits are consistent with our plan. We think it's likely that the Synchrony split occurs this year.","GE Capital asset sales closings are tracking towards $100 billion of ENI, and we expect signings in excess of that number. Free cash flow is on track for $12 billion to $15 billion, and we're hoping to expand the GE Capital dividend based on faster asset sales. And just for perspective, Appliances represents about $2 billion of the dispositioned cash. We've showed a range of $10 billion to $30 billion of cash returned to investors. Our capital allocation plans are on track. And if Synchrony occurs this year, we will be at the high end of this range.","So the GE team is executing. Despite managing a substantial portfolio pivot, our operating execution remains excellent. We're gaining momentum towards our long-term goals, and going forward we can give investors strong Industrial EPS growth while returning significant cash through dividends and buyback. And we've created a premier industrial company, well positioned to win in this environment.","So, Matt, let's take some questions.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Thanks, Jeff. I'll now turn it over to the operator to open up the phone lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Scott.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Happy Friday summer. Hopefully we can all go home a little early, as this earnings release is relatively easy to get through versus the past, so thanks for that. I wanted to ask a couple questions, and first one just related to Oil & Gas. When you take the order book and the pricing in that order book and you push it forward to whatever the typical backlog of that is, let's say it's six months or so, can you hold margins when you get to that timeframe? How does that mix shift look? I'm just trying to get a sense of how you even think about modeling a down 20%-plus order book in that business.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, I'll start and then let Jeff also add some perspective. I think our expectation always was that we could hold margins as we went through this process. And you've seen that so far this year. I think going into the cyclicality in oil and gas, there were a number of, I would say, inefficiencies already in the industry. So I think there were good productivity opportunities from the start. We'll take out $600 million-ish of cost this year. That will be more next year. So we've been able to do a good job on cost. And I think the combination of those things and the mix of businesses we have I think gives us a perspective that we should be able to hold on margins going forward despite a more challenging market.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The only thing I would add is that $1 billion cost-out target for 2016 is absolutely critical to me. There's no question that although we've not repriced any of the existing order book, there's no question that new orders are going to be challenging from a pricing perspective. That's why all the work around restructuring and product service cost is so critical in terms of profitability and operating margins. So the team is executing ahead of plan. We feel really good about their ability to execute on that cost roadmap that we've laid out with them.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow -p just on asset sales you made a commentary and said that things are ahead of plan. Volume is certainly ahead of plan. But can you give us a sense of the pricing and how \u2013 and I know this stuff hasn't happened yet, but indications of interest and such, and you're probably in various stages of price discovery. But give us a sense of really where pricing is coming in versus your expectations.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So if you think about it in terms of deals that Keith and the team have signed, right now we're roughly \u2013 excluding real estate, we're about 5%, a little over 5% ahead of the fair values we used on the April 10 call over the baseline, if you will, for the Hubble. So so far I think we're doing better on price than that baseline. Having said that, because we're accelerating the sales of these portfolios and franchises, that means the earnings that we're going to enjoy over what we thought the whole period was going to be, is shortened. And so right now I would say those two things more or less offset each other. Better on price for what we signed so far, but we're selling them quick and we'll earn less as a result of not owning them as long as we thought.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","We can live with that.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So still on track for the prices.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, still on track.","Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah, now, I get it. Okay. Thanks, guys, and good luck.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey. Thanks, and good morning, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","So I just want to make sure I understand a little bit how you're thinking about the one-time items and restructuring offsetting the gains. On the NBCU gains side, what drove that this many years later? And how do you think about that from an accounting or maybe reporting perspective, in terms of comparison with Lake and other things that you treated in discontinued operations, versus putting this one in continued op? I just want to understand the logic there.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It was a result of an agreement when the initial JV was set up. It hit a life span that spanned many years, and in the second quarter, we and Comcast agreed to settle that arrangement, if you will. It was $450 million in the quarter as we talked about, about $0.03 after tax. The accounting around it has it in continuing operations, the accounting doesn't push it into discontinued operations. So it's just a function of how the accounting works.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. But why would Lake have been in DiscOps, but not this?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Because we moved the whole Lake operation into discontinued operations, and including the liability that we had with Shinsei associated with it around the guarantee and the runoff of that book.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We had a contiguous piece of NBC as a result of this JV operation that was in continuing ops, and we just settled it. And it's always been there.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, all right, fair enough. Next question, what is the transactions that we're talking about? I know you can't comment a lot on Appliances and Alstom. If they do not close by the end of the year, how would that affect the operating framework that you've laid out quantitatively?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So here's how I think about it. I mean generally speaking if we didn't close Alstom, the impact in 2015 would be pretty de minimis. It would not have that big an impact. I think we told you that we were expecting Alstom net of everything to be about a $0.01 a share in the year. So on Appliances, obviously the framework included the gain associated with Appliances. And we pick up a couple more quarters of earnings than we had anticipated that will offset part of that. And then we'd relook at what we're doing around restructuring. Right now we're talking about $0.12 of restructuring, and we'd rethink about whether we're going to do $0.12 of restructuring. So that's how we're thinking about the framework for the year.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And on that topic, Jeff, I know you set expectations for how you were thinking about potential concessions with Alstom at EPG, and you guys were on the table this week on that front, and you can't disclose the detail, but can you let us know how consistent what you provided is with your prior commentary?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So Steve, again, we're constrained on what we can say. I think the proposal is confidential, and it's not final really until the commission evaluates and make a decision. What I would say is that we proposed a remedy that addressed their concerns while preserving really the strategic and economic rationale that I reviewed with you guys in the past. And look, we still like the deal for the company, and more news as the process goes on. But we like the deal, and it's consistent with the things economically, that we've talked about as the rationale for the deal.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, Thanks. I'll hand it on.","Operator","The next question comes from Shannon O'Callaghan with UBS.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Steven E. Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning, Shannon.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Can we go through a little bit more on these margin drivers, they moved a decent bit from what they were in the first quarter. The mix got a lot more negative. I think GEnx was a good part of that, and then value gap and cost productivity got a lot better. Can you just run through kind of what moved those things, relative to what we saw last quarter?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, sure, Shannon. So as you know, mix was actually a good guy in the first quarter. It was negative during the second quarter at 70 basis points. For the half, it's negative 10 basis points. As we said in the first quarter, we expected mix to turn around a little bit here in the second quarter, and in fact it did. And you're correct, part of that is the higher GEnx shipments and it's also a function of higher wind shipments and lower distributed power quarter-to-quarter. So that's what happened on the mix line.","Value gap got substantially better. Value gap in the second quarter was about $193 million. It's $221 million for the half, so up substantially from $28 million of value gap in the first quarter. And we continue to deliver cost productivity on product and service. And so the second quarter, we had 60 basis points of margin improvement in the gross margin line, and then 70 basis points at op profit. So the net of simplification and other inflation added 10 basis points below gross margins. So that gave us, first half of 70 basis points improvement in the gross margin line and 100 basis points at op profit, so those were really the dynamics. I think mix turned around like we thought it would, versus extremely strong first quarter, and value gap got substantially better.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And how should we think about these different dynamics playing out for the rest of the year?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So I think what we said earlier in the year is that we thought mix would be plus or minus for the year. And I think we still feel like, based on backlog and what we expect order shipments to look like, for that to be roughly correct. I said value gap for the year would be roughly as it was in 2014. 2014 was about $300 million. We're a little ahead of that run rate here through the half. We'll see how that plays out. Price has been pretty good actually, both in Power & Water and Aviation. So that's how I \u2013 I don't think the framework is changed materially from what we told you earlier in the year.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just on assessing this 2015 Capital dividend, we got the $100 billion of sale assumptions and the 14% Tier-1. Is there something else that could move that significantly off of being a $1 billion dividend plan for the year for Capital?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, I think, we're hopeful that as we move through, and Keith and the team close these $100 billion of transactions, that that 11.4% Tier-1 common rate is going to move to 14% and beyond. And for them to be in a position to dividend as money this year, we need to be above the 14%. We have a few other moving pieces we're working. We have a stress test we got to do, et cetera. But we're hopeful that we can outperform the $500 million, certainly, they've given us so far. And we gave you a range here of $0.5 billion to $7 billion in April 10, and I think we're kind of still in that range.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","And is there a time when you make that decision, or is it based on the timing of asset sales?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's based on the timing of asset sales, and more likely not would be late fourth quarter.","Shannon O'Callaghan - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Deane Dray with RBC Capital Markets.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Deane. How are you doing?","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Doing really well, thanks. Hey, just going back to the Alstom deal, and I know there's sensitivities here, but can we talk about the plan B? If you do have to walk away from a compromised deal, is it clear that you would put all that deal Capital right into buybacks?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Deane, I'm just not going to go there. I think we like this deal. It's our intention to really close the deal, and that's really where our stand is. So let's just leave it at that.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sure. I appreciate that. And then just moving the focus over to geographical for a moment. And I don't know, it just struck me as ironic that this quarter the growth markets were the laggards. And maybe you can comment on that, in particular, the 2% Healthcare was weak in China, but it doesn't seem to be a longer term trend. But just kind of parse through the dynamics on the growth markets.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So let's see, Deane. I'd say the \u2013 if I just gave you a kind of half to-date, on China, the orders are up 15% and the revenue's up 12%, that's kind of, let's say, first half 2015 versus first half 2014. And then if you looked at some of the growth regions from a standpoint of orders, I'd say Latin America and Middle East\/North Africa, those places are hanging in there. We're certainly seeing pressure in places like Russia and ASEAN countries. But I'd say the strength is the diversity of the portfolio, and it's our expectation for the year that these are kind of ex-FX, probably high single digits, mid to high single-digits on the growth regions for the year.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would just add, Jeff, that we're kind of in the cycle now where the developed markets are stronger than...","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So in the U.S. in the second quarter we were up 10% on orders. I talked about Japan being up, ex-FX up very strong, up 86%. And Europe was actually up 4% ex the effects of exchange. So the developed markets seem to be getting a little bit stronger and the developing markets are certainly much more mixed.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say mixed, yeah.","Deane Dray - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Deane.","Operator","The next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, just a couple questions. Just on the additional restructuring, I was just wondering what it is you might be targeting? And I guess specifically thinking about the quarter, it sounds like only about 40% of the restructuring spend is actions that might have some kind of payback as opposed to mortality and other kind of loose ends cleanup. Is that correct, and how do we think about that going forward?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So we think we have a number of opportunities to increase the amount of restructuring to get ourselves positioned for 2016 and beyond, particularly around competitiveness. As I said earlier, if for some reason we didn't close Appliances, we may take a harder look at that. Of the restructuring we spent in the quarter, about $140 million of that was in Oil & Gas, and we see very good paybacks around that. All the projects we're working on today are all inside of the 1.5 year payback kind of benchmark that we've shared with you over time. The nature of the restructuring has changed pretty dramatically, though. There's about \u2013 less than a third of what we're doing today is SG&A related, and more like 70% \u2013 75% of it is product and services. We really focus on gross margins in products and service cost competitiveness. So I think we're on track to invest at very good returns and restructuring this year, and they're critical to delivering not only the year but setting us up to deliver on 2016 and beyond.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And is the mortality hit just a one-time adjustment? I thought that was more of an ongoing change in pension costs.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","It's a change for the year that we planned out in restructuring and other charges. It's about $40 million in the quarter pre-tax, so it's $20 million after tax. It's not a big item.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then just switching gears, Oil & Gas Services, the weakness in orders there, what's actually driving that? It's a little surprising it's weaker than equipment orders. Do you see people pulling back on OpEx as opposed to CapEx or some other timing noise there in the quarter?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Some of it's timing. Services across the board were pretty challenged here in the quarter. I would say the biggest driver, as you would probably expect, has been surface. Orders were quite weak around pressure control, well performance solutions. Lufkin was down 40% in the quarter. So that's really where the challenge is. But each one of the businesses had a challenge around service in the quarter.","Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi, thank you. I just wanted to ask around the PGS orders. I think they were very strong, up 17% or so. You called out what's going on in some of the emerging markets, but maybe give some more color on thermal power services in the U.S. and Europe, what you're seeing.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, excellent work on the AGPs, I would say, Julian, continues to be robust. I think just the overall mix and usage around gas turbines is high, as there's an incremental shift from coal. So those remain two big drivers I think of power gen services. And I would say DP services, despite the new unit being softer in distributed power, the distributed power service business has done very well in terms of upgrades and service performance. So I think they had another good quarter and are pretty well positioned for the rest of the year.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I'll just do a quick run through. So service is up 17%, as you referred to. Jeff talked about 39 AGPs in orders in the quarter. That's up 20 versus last year, very strong. But distributed power services were up 27%, and regionally orders were very strong. In the Middle East we're up above 60%. And ASEAN, China, the combination of ASEAN, China, and India was up 38%. So very strong in the quarter, and we like where the business is heading for the year as well.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And Oil & Gas, a fairly disparate collection of assets and backlog length and so on. You sound pretty confident on the earnings outlook for this year for that segment. How much of the balance of the second half sales and earnings are in your backlog as of now?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So at the moment, in total about 67% of sales in the third and fourth quarter are in backlog. As you would expect, subsea and drilling were closer to 85% in backlog, TMS much higher, downstream technology about 80% backlog. So the business that's got the biggest and closest to a flow business is surface. Surface got about a third of their second half revenue in backlog. So we think we're in pretty good shape here for the balance of 2015.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, I would go to the mix of businesses. Turbo machinery and downstream continue to be reasonably strong. Surface, as Jeff said, is the most challenged. So I think the mix of businesses helps give us a little bit more visibility than maybe some others.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. And just very quickly, Healthcare, should we think profits are maybe flat this year rather than seeing growth? I think they were flat in the first half.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I think organically earnings are definitely going to be up, and we expect a team with restructuring, and the fact that the U.S. market is doing better, we expect earnings growth in the second half even without FX.","Julian C. H. Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great, thanks.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hello, thanks. Good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Nigel.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I just wanted to continue with the Oil & Gas theme. Pricing this quarter is actually better than last quarter, down 1.2% versus down 1.4%. I'm just wondering. Do you feel that the boundaries on Oil & Gas are now more defined? Do you feel more confidence in where this goes in the second half of the year? And are you confident you can maintain price deflation in this zone?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, I still think, Nigel, the industry is forming, so I think there's still volatility around oil price. I think we've taken a lot of costs out. I think everybody's learned how to compete at lower prices for oil. So I'm very confident in our ability to execute on the cost side. I would say the repricing is still de minimis, so we're not seeing massive headwind from that. And I just think it's one of those that we're going to have to continue to give you updates on where the market is. But I just think we can manage our way through this.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Julian alluded to the Healthcare margins, and I'm wondering. What is holding back the margins? We've seen a positive mix in life sciences. Obviously, there's a lot of work on G&A. So I'm wondering. Are we seeing here a negative mix as developed markets outperform emerging markets?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","These guys have \u2013 how much FX is in this Healthcare number, Jeff? It's more than $100 million, isn't it?","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes, FX in Healthcare was $40 million of translation in the quarter.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","And that's why the organic number is better than (52:53).","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jeffrey S. Bornstein - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Now, I think what we have going on in Healthcare, they've got a real price challenge. Price sequentially is down over a point. They've continued to get base cost productivity. Where we need them to focus is on product and service margins. So it's not necessarily a mix issue. You're absolutely right, life science and bioprocess continues to grow. What we need to get at is product and service costs within the core HCS business, and that's what we're focused on driving.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. And then just a final one. Obviously Alstom, there's not a lot you can say there, but it's in the press that there's a deadline for your proposals and you've already made proposals. Are we still working towards the middle list timeline for a decision, or is that being pushed back to later in the quarter?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the timeline right now is in early to mid-September, I believe, is where the timeline is, Nigel. And I think that's probably a pretty good timeframe.","Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks a lot, guys.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Just more Oil & Gas. So what are you hearing about your customers on oil and gas side? Are you getting pressure requests to be the consolidator of the supply chain? It just seems that people broadly want to deal with people with real balance sheets and people that can survive the storm.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look Andrew, I think that there's a certain amount that I think is going to be in play in that regard. I don't think that is a recent phenomenon. I think that started back several years. And so there remains in the oil and gas business a real opportunity to drive better system efficiency between suppliers and the IOCs and the NOCs. And we look at this cycle as a good opportunity for us to drive efficiency.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and just a follow-up question. Looking your organic growth rates and order growth rates and compare them to what we're seeing from the macro, it just seems you guys are taking market share. You're a very large company taking a lot of market share. How long do you think you can do it without triggering a price response from your competition that's seemingly getting clobbered?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look, in our world, technology matters. And so if you look at the Aviation business, if you look at locomotives, if you look at gas turbines, if you look at Healthcare, we have a great lineup of technologies that are quite robust. And in the end, that's the way you can gain good market position and margins at the same time. And then on the service side, I think our analytics are starting to play through both from a pricing standpoint and also from a productivity standpoint. So that's another example of technology, and what it can drive. So I think...","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So you'll look at it as a payoff on your investments over the past couple or many years.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Definitely. I definitely do.","Andrew Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Great. Jeff. A few quick items before you wrap up. The replay of today's webcast will be available this afternoon on our website. We'll hold our third quarter 2015 earnings webcast on Friday, October 16. And as always we'll be available later today for questions. Jeff?","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thanks, Matt. Again, I think you guys see the portfolio taking shape, and the hard work we've done. But I really want to call out the great execution by the GE team in the quarter. I think margins, organic growth, cash, GE Capital portfolio re-positioning, the GE team really did a great job of execution in the quarter. So Matt, back to you.","Matthew G. Cribbins - Vice President-Corporate Investor Communications","Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey R. Immelt - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","This concludes your conference call. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect."]}}
