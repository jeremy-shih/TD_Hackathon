At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and our capital allocation changes released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to slide two, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for first quarter and full year 2013, the integration of Qwest and Savvis, our capital allocation changes and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press releases and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us and our forward-looking statements.","We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Joining Glen will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer; and also available during the question-and-answer period of today's call will be Karen Puckett, CenturyLink's Chief Operating Officer; Bill Cheek, President of Wholesale Operations, and Jim Ousley, Chief Executive Officer of Savvis.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through February 20, 2013, and accessible by webcast through March 6, 2013. Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call, should note that all information presented is current only as of February 13, 2013 and should be considered valid only as of this date regardless of the date heard or viewed.","As we move to slide four, I will now turn the call over to your host today, Glen Post. Glen?","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. We will also provide guidance for the first quarter and full year 2013 as well as other important updates about our business. We are pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results and we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts.","Starting on slide five, I would like to highlight the progress CenturyLink made in 2012 towards achieving the goals we set a year ago. Our top line pro forma revenue trend continued to improve in 2012 with an annual revenue decline of 1.7%, compared to 3.8% decline in pro forma 2011 and an estimated 5.6% decline in pro forma 2010. This continued improvement is driven by strength in our strategic products, including high-speed internet, Prism TV, high-bandwidth, our data services to enterprise customers and wholesale customers, and our hosting services.","For full year 2013, we believe we will reduce our annual revenue rate of decline to the 0.5% to 1.5% range and we expect to reach revenues stability in 2014. While we continue to face declines in legacy services, we believe we have the right asset mix in place to stabilize our top line and grow revenues over time.","Continuing onto slide six. During the year we achieved strong improvement in access line loss and continued the subscriber growth in broadband and Prism TV services. We added over 196,000 broadband subscribers and nearly 45,000 Prism TV subscribers during the year.","In Enterprise Markets network segment during 2012, we grew recurring revenue for four consecutive quarter, driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services revenue. In addition, we made continued progress on the Fiber-to-the-tower initiative completing over 4,500 fiber builds during 2012, ending the year with approximately 14,700 within our territory.","During 2012, we continued to expand the global reach of our colocation and managed services, adding three new data centers, expanding available space in four existing data centers. Also in December, we launched savvisdirect, our simplified approach to cloud computing for both, small and large businesses.","During 2012, we increased our operating expense synergy target related to Qwest acquisition from $575 million to $650 million, and we are pleased with our synergy achievement throughout last year as we ended 2012 with an annual synergy run rate of $480 million.","Moving now to slide seven. I will provide a few highlights from the fourth quarter of 2012 regarding our key strategic initiatives. As we have outlined over the past several quarters, we are focused on continued strategic investment in broadband services expansion and enhancement of Prism TV, Fiber-to-the-tower and our hosting and cloud computing services. Our fourth quarter results reflect the continued progress we are making in these key initiatives.","Starting with broadband expansion enhancement, we continued to make significant investments in this area and during the fourth quarter we added over 41,000 high-speed internet subscribers. With these new subscribers we now have more than 5.85 million broadband customers. Our customer retention efforts and the growth benefits of bundling broadband with other products and services contributed to the improvement in the decline of the rate of access line loss which improved from 6.6% in the fourth quarter 2011 to 5.7% in fourth quarter 2012.","We also expanded our Fiber-to-the-node infrastructure to more than 274,000 new living units during the quarter, adding nearly one million living units in 2012. We now passed over 7.1 million living units with Fiber-to-the-node technology","As a result of our network investment enhancements, broadband speed availability has continued to improve. Over 70% of our enabled access lines receive 6 megabits or higher. Nearly 60% of enabled lines receive 10 megabits or higher and 31% have speeds of 20 megabits or higher.","We have been very focused on expanding our Ethernet and MPLS services for our business customers. During the quarter, we continued to expand our Ethernet over Copper footprint which has increased over 80% in 2012 to over 700 Ethernet enabled central offices. We expect to continue making investments in our network, enhance speed capabilities in order to continue delivering competitive broadband products and services across our markets.","Turning to slide eight. Our Prism TV service continues to perform well and represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV service in the markets where it is currently available. We added over 10,000 Prism TV subscribers during the fourth quarter ending the year with 115,000 subscribers. Of the 45,000 new subscribers, we have added over the past 12 months, over 50% were new subscribers or new customers to CenturyLink.","We now have a penetration rate of nearly 11% across eight markets in which the service is available during 2012. In addition we continued to enhance our IPTV features by introducing new functionality and applications, including expansion of our TV Everywhere capabilities, our video-on-demand library and successful trial of wireless set-top boxes. Prism TV continues to have a positive impact on churn and line loss trends.","We experienced greater than 90% broadband pull through rate with our Prism TV sales to new customers. We continued to expand our Prism TV enabled footprint and expect to have additional subscriber growth in the months ahead.","As announced last quarter, Phoenix will be the first legacy Qwest market to receive Prism TV service. The soft launch occurred in late December and the early results and impressions are favorable. We are optimistic about success in this market. The Phoenix market will be commercially launched in the first half of 2013 and we also expect to enter a second legacy Qwest market in mid-2013.","Continuing on to slide nine. A third key strategic initiative for us is investing in fiber builds to as many towers in our service area as is economically feasible. During the fourth quarter, we completed approximately 1,175 Fiber-to-the-tower builds for a total of over 4,500 during 2012.","Current, we have over 14,700 fiber builds completed across our footprint and we anticipate completing an additional 4,000 to 5,000 builds in 2013. This initiative supports anticipated long-term growth in data transport, much of which is driven by wireless data traffic. It also expands our addressable customer footprint by enabling fiber access points to other strategic locations where it's viable along these routes. We believe our Fiber-to-the-tower program have solidified our wholesale access revenue for the long term and assist in the stabilization of our revenue trends.","As we have discussed with you before we are experiencing some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper based DS1 facilities to Fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we do anticipate that wireless bandwidth growth will result in expansion of Ethernet consumption reversing the current revenue compression by early 2014. On average, bandwidth capacity of initial fiber-based connections is increasing.","Moving onto slide 10. We continue to invest in managed hosting and cloud services to increase datacenter capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. We are seeing benefits from our investments in this area and realize the highest quarterly bookings in four years in the fourth quarter rebounded from the third quarter. We continued to expand our facilities and opened a data center, Frankfurt, Germany in the fourth quarter. With this facility, we ended the quarter with 54 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia, with total sellable floor space of about 1.4 million square feet as we continue to expand the global reach of our Managed Hosting Services.","We anticipate increasing hosting and cloud revenue expansion opportunities in 2013 as we further train and enable our sales channels for business and wholesale customers. In October, we announced the beta launch of savvisdirect, our simplified approach to cloud computing with small and large businesses, the commercial launch occurred launch in December and early indications are promising. And finally, on October 15th, we closed acquisition of certain assets of Ciber's global IT outsourcing business. In addition these outfit assets will complement savvis' existing ITO assets by expanding our capabilities for application management services and helpdesk support.","Now turning to slide 11, I want to address our announcement today regarding changes to our capital allocation strategy. We have decided to repurchase up to an aggregate $2 billion of our outstanding common stock for the next two-year period ending February 13, 2015, and we've decided to reduce our quarterly dividend to $0.54 a share from $0.725 per share.","Just little history here is backdrop. As we were finalizing our budget for 2013 and working with the rating agencies, it became apparent that in order to maintain investment grade ratings, we need to reduce investment. We need to reduce investments in the business and our growth that is investments and really on our growth initiatives, and\/or we need to reduce dividend significantly and use 100% of free cash flow to repay debt. Again, if we want to maintain our investment grade rating, we decided that it is in the long-term best interest for the company and our investors to significantly reduce the dividend and use the proceed to payback debt to maintain investment grade rating.","We believe it is important to continue to invest capital in our growth initiatives that will help bring us to revenue and EBITDA growth and returning cash to shareholders as well. Also we determined if we were willing to accept the loss of investment grade rating we could return more cash to shareholder during 2013, 2014, and we were even with reducing the current dividend and while in implementing our share our repurchase program. We decided to take advantage of the opportunity to get more cash to shareholders now and adjust the dividend to a level that will be closer to the payout ratio that we have historically maintained actually we've utilized all our NOLs.","So, we expect to be a full cash taxpayer in 2015. And as with this plan, we will be able to continue to investment in our business and our growth initiatives at a strong level. We've worked to make our decisions based on our ability to drive long-term shareholder value and we believe these decisions, these changes will do just that.","On the slide 12, in summary before handling the call to Stewart let me say I am pleased with our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results. We continue to improve our top line revenue trend and reach the target level of rate declines we set early last year. We reduced our access line losses by 9% compared to fourth quarter 2011 and we achieved good high speed internet subscriber growth as well as a solid increase in the number of Prism TV customers. Also the focused investments we made in our key strategic initiatives have positively contributed to strategic revenue growth and continue to improve our top line, our revenue trend. We believe the soft launch of Prism TV into the Phoenix market in the December and the subsequent commercial launch in the first half of this year will position us well to grow video subscribers during 2013 and beyond. We are also optimistic about leveraging the acquisition of Savvis to generate organic growth, our new savvisdirect product offers the opportunity to gain market share in the fast-growing cloud space across our entire range of customers.","Finally, we believe the capital allocation initiatives announced today will further our strategy investing key drivers to stabilize and grow top line revenues. In addition to the share repurchase program our very competitive cash dividend we will be able to significantly increase the total cash returned to shareholders in the next two years.","With that I will turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stewart?","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I will spend the next few minutes for reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the first quarter and full year 2013 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Turning to slide 14, I will be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. With that let's turn to our results for the fourth quarter. As you can see we generated solid operating revenues and cash flows. Operating revenues were $4.58 billion on a consolidated basis, which was in line with our guidance for the quarter and represent a 1.5% decline from fourth quarter 2011 operating revenues. This also represents a solid improvement from the 3.2% annual decline in the year ago.","Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 46% of total revenue from 44% in the fourth quarter year ago due to growth in strategic products such as high-speed internet, high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and Managed Hosting Services, adjusted diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter was $0.67, meeting our guidance.","As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. Total cash operating expenses decreased from fourth quarter 2011 to fourth quarter 2012. This decline was primarily the result of lower personnel related costs being partially offset by higher data hosting and network costs.","We generated solid operating cash flow of approximately $1.91 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 41.7%. Additionally, we generated $610 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income.","Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Turning to slide 15; year-over-year revenue declined 1.5% from fourth quarter 2011. The decline was primarily a result of the growth in strategic revenue and other revenues being offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. Strategic revenue growth was driven by strength in high-speed internet, high bandwidth data services and hosting services.","Now turning to slide 16; I will discuss each of our operating segments beginning with our regional markets segment. Regional markets generated $2.45 billion of operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 3.9% over fourth quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew to $914 million in the quarter, up 3.6% over a year ago.","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined $120 million or 7.6% from fourth quarter 2011, due primarily to a continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues, partially mitigated by implementation of the ARC in July of 2012. The expenses declined $20 million or 1.9% compared to the previous year driven mainly by lower employee related and data integration expenses which were partially offset by higher Prism TV cost.","Moving to Slide 17, our Wholesale Markets segment generated $908 million in operating revenues, a decline of 5.5% from fourth quarter 2011. Strategic revenues for Wholesale Markets were $572 million, up slightly from fourth quarter 2011, primarily driven by growth of Ethernet services offset by rate compression in special access services as customers transitioned from copper based to Ethernet based services.","Wholesale Markets legacy revenues declined by 14% to $335 million reflecting the continued decline in access and long-distance minutes of use and the implementation of the CAF Order write step down. Operating expenses for the quarter were $271 million, 13% below the same period from the prior year driven by lower access and other cost.","Moving to slide 18, Enterprise Markets - Network segment generated $671 million in operating revenues during the quarter, which represented an increase of 5.7% from fourth quarter 2011. This marked the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in recurring revenues for the Network Services segment.","Fourth quarter strategic revenues for Enterprise Markets \u2013 Network increased by $25 million or 8% to $346 million from fourth quarter 2011, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as; MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. Excluding private line services, strategic revenue was up nearly 13% from a year ago.","Legacy revenues were basically flat from a year ago period while data integration revenues increased $12 million or 12% due to higher equipment sales and professional services revenues from government and enterprise customers. Our total segment expenses were flat year-over-year.","Now, turning to slide 19, our Enterprise Markets data hosting segment, which is primarily legacy Ciber's operations, this segment generated $292 million in operating revenues representing an increase of 13% from fourth quarter 2011 revenues of $259 million. This growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 9.6% in colocation revenues, 21% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues and a 3.6% increase in network services revenues.","Fourth quarter 2012 EMG data hosting revenues include approximately $13 million of revenue contribution from the Ciber IT outsourcing assets acquired in October 2012. Excluding this revenue managed hosting revenue grew about 8% year-over-year. Soft bookings in the third quarter 2012 and higher than normal churn primarily due to customer bankruptcy events pressured fourth quarter 2012 data hosting revenue. Enterprise markets data hosting operating expenses were $235 million in the fourth quarter compared to $202 million in fourth quarter year ago. This increase of 16% is driven by added operations and sales and marketing headcount to support revenue growth including headcount to the savvisdirect, and enabling sales channels, along with expenses related to the acquisition of Ciber ITO assets not present in the prior period.","In early January we announced an organizational realignment combining our network services business sales and operations teams into one organization which is led by our Chief Operating Officer, Karen Puckett.","Slide 20, highlights the revised reporting structure. The reorganization combines business sales and operations functions that previously resided in the enterprise markets network services and regional markets organizations. We believe this change allows us to better serve our business customers by streamlining our end-to-end service delivery and support and sales of network services to our enterprise customers by creating one cohesive organization.","Beginning with results for first quarter 2013, the company will report the following four segments, consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting services. While the consumer and business segments will be different from today's reporting structure, wholesale and data hosting segment will remain unchanged from what was have previously known as wholesale markets and enterprise markets data hosting. To assist the investment community in understanding the underlying trends in each segment, we expect to provide historical pro forma segment financial statements when we report first quarter 2013 earnings.","On slide 21, we provide our first quarter and full year 2013 guidance. We expect first quarter 2013 operating revenues and operating cash flow to increase compared to fourth quarter 2012, primarily due to the decline in legacy and data integration revenues. Similar to last year, we also anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2013 driven primarily by the impact of our annual review and updated depreciation and amortization writes. This anticipated lower level of depreciation and amortization expense, approximately $100 million below the level in the fourth quarter 2012, is expected to more than offset the decline in operating cash flow and result in an increase in adjusted diluted EPS in the first quarter of 2013 compared to fourth quarter of 2012.","For first quarter of 2013, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.46 billion to $4.51 billion and operating cash flow between $1.83 billion and $1.88 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.67 to $0.72 per share. For the full year 2013, CenturyLink expects total operating revenues of $18.1 billion to $18.3 billion reflecting a year-over-year revenue decline of 0.5% to 1.5%. Operating cash flow is expected to be between $7.3 billion and $7.5 billion and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $2.50 to $2.70.","Capital expenditures are expected to range from $2.8 billion to $3 billion driven by spending in our key growth areas, data hosting will spend $325 million to $375 million, HSI expansion and HSI capacity will spend between $350 million and $375 million, and our Fiber-to-the-tower will continue to spend about $250 million to $300 million in this area, our Prism TV with the launch of the Phoenix and one other market, we expect to spend $100 million to $150 million and maintenance CapEx is expected to remain around the 20% to 25% of total capital expenditures level.","We anticipate free cash flow for full year 2013 between $3 billion and $3.2 billion. CenturyLink anticipates full year 2013 operating cash flow and free cash flow to decline from full year 2012 primarily driven by the impact of the decline in legacy revenue along with a lower level of incremental synergies in 2013 compared to the level of incremental synergies achieved in 2012. The company also anticipates a decline in depreciation and amortization expense for full year 2013 compared to full year 2012.","That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time I will ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Mike McCormack from Nomura.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Stewart, can you just sort of dig in for us on the cash cost. Obviously in '13, you have got some pressure on EBITDA and you mentioned the fat that the Qwest synergies don\u2019t recur. I suspect that won't happen in 2014 either. So as we look out at EBITDA trajectory, is there anything unusual in '13 from a cash cost perspective or should we just expect an even level of potentially declining EBITDA tracking revenue or are there actual levers to pull on the cash cost side to get margins to at least stabilize?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. So, Mike, basically, the cash expense drivers in '13 over '12, about $165 million or so is associated to lower incremental synergies that we will have in 2013 than we had in 2012. So lower incremental synergies of about $165 million. We will still increase the total run rate synergies from the $480 million that we exited 2012 to about $600 million by the time we exit 2013 but just the incremental amount will be less than last year.","So the incremental synergies really, to a certain extent, masked the revenue mix shift that we had from legacy revenues which are very high margin revenues to the strategic revenues, which tend to be lower margin. Additionally, other expense drivers that we have for 2013 are Ciber. There will be about $45 million of incremental expenses there. Then in our IPTV there will be some incremental expenses there as well.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Okay, so when you think about the buyback, it still seems like that a fairly low amount of buyback over a fairly long period of time and stock tomorrow will likely get beaten pretty hard. Is there any way that you guys could accelerate that?","Stewart Ewing","We could depending on what happens to the stock price, Mike. I mean we could be in and potentially buy the shares a little bit sooner or use some financing to purchase the shares a little bit sooner than the 24 month period.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Okay, thanks guys.","Glen Post","We do plan to buyback about 8% of our total outstanding though with the $2 billion.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS","Thanks, I just want to reconcile some of the prior comments that you had made. I think you had mentioned that if you are comfortable with revenue trends improving, stabilizing, you could even consider maybe a small dividend increase just to keep it consistent. I guess I just want to get a sense of how you feel about revenue trends going forward? Your 2015 dividend payout guidance of lower than 60%, I think implies a pretty significant decline to free cash flow per share from the current levels. Can you talk about that as well?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. So, Batya, the decline that you that you can back into basically by looking at the dividend payout ratio or the approximate dividend payout ratio in 2015 is really due to the fact that we, in 2014, would utilize all of the federal net operating loss carryforwards that we have and our cash taxes will increase substantially. But we expect, barring any changes in the tax loss, to increase substantially in 2015. So that\u2019s the reason. That's one of the reasons we decided to go ahead and take advantage of this at this point in time and be proactive and try to address the dividend and again try to return more cash to shareholders over the next two years before becoming a full tax payer to allow us to retire 8% or more of our shares which will reduce the dividend even at the new rate by little over $100 million dollars, probably between now and 2015, which again allows us to really be a lot more comfortable with the dividend that we are moving to on a going forward basis.","Batya Levi - UBS","Excluding that increase in the taxes, how do you think about revenue trends from here towards '15 and EBITDA and CapEx if you could talk a little bit about that too?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. So, Batya, we still expect, as Glen indicated, revenue to flatten out in 2014 compared with 2013 and we would hopefully be able to grow revenue thereafter at least that's our current thinking.","EBITDA may not stable quite as quickly, because we will continue to have some of the revenue mix shift where you continue to lose some of the higher margin revenue that's replaced with lower margin revenue, but we would be helpful that we would continue to close the gap in '14 and '15 in terms of flattening out EBITDA, and eventually starting to grow EBITDA and all of that is really without any business as usual, expense cuts in the event we are able to find ways to cut costs to a certain extent over and above the synergies that we expect to get over the next couple of years. It would enable us to be able to hopefully get to EBITDA stability a little quicker.","Batya Levi - UBS","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Can you un-mute your phone if you have your phone on mute.","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thanks a lot. Can we talk about the capital spending? How should we think about the level for 2013? Is that a run rate level or some of the projects like IPTV and Fiber-to-the-tower peaking this year, if you give us a little color there? And on the cost side, can you update us on a couple of items, the labor negotiations and any contributions to the pension fund? Thanks.","Glen Post","Simon, on contributions to the pension fund, we made a contribution of about $146 million and $147 million in the early 2013 and that will suffice we believe. It will certainly cover all the required contributions that we have to make this year. So, I think we've done what we need to do there for this year. In terms of CapEx levels, yes, I'll let Stewart do it.","Stewart Ewing","In the $2.9 billion level that reflects all the investments we make in the new initiatives, Simon as you pointed out. Excluding Fiber-to-the-tower about $600 million of that is success based capital. We have revenues locked in and we really expect that from locked in, and we make those investments. We included Fiber-to-the-tower, we have the contract. We have close to $900 million, almost a third of that expand is success based.","So, we continue to build out our systems and we have opportunity to grow, do hosting or Prism, we'll do it on a success basis really. We expect to continue to drive additional revenues. If we are successful in these areas, if we have more opportunity, we'll continue to invest in these areas, we're not - we don't have to, so we'll see how this goes, but right now in 2013, again we really have about a third of our CapEx in success based type CapEx expenditures.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","And on the labor deal or negotiations?","Glen Post","Yes. On the labor, the current contract expired back in October and we've been working with the union agreed to extend the agreements day-by-day or day-to-day, as we continued the negotiations. I think everybody is negotiating in good faith. We're making progress, but it's been obviously much slower than we had hoped or expected, but we all believe we are all making progress.","It is our desire to reach agreement that will help the company better align our cost with a very competitive marketplace while still providing really good competitive wages and benefits for our employees and we think we will get there and we are hopeful that we reach agreement with union in the next several weeks, but it's been much slower than we've expected, but we believe we are making progress.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Great. Thank you. So, in going through the process, just curious why wouldn't you consider cutting the dividend further or if you're applied standing up to the rating agencies a little bit, but why not leave the dividend where it is and just buyback less stock. What is sort of the thinking there. And if you're on a path to get to the point, where EBITDA is stable, why do we have to necessarily consider cutting the dividend or is there or is it just taking that much longer than your original plan when you look back in and acquiring Savvis and Qwest, is it just taking longer to get there?","Glen Post","I will start and let Stewart follow-up, Frank. First of all, we didn't think it was good to reduce the dividend further. We know that we believe we need to return cash to shareholders. We believe a 25% cut is something not what we would want to doing in a perfect world, but something we think is important to do now. We do want to maintain the payout ratio. We've historically been comfortable with, and that 60% below or less than 60% ratio.","We felt like if we payback, if we continue with the dividend now, there is no real benefit in one sense, because once there is uncertainty about the 2015 payout ratio, then it's really like a one-time dividend or payout sales, we don't think is the right thing to do, so we decided it was better to buy stock back with those funds, plus additional another 50% of our free cash flow or so and take advantage of that accretion. And with the dividend at a level we are very comfortable with going forward. What we won't see that we think the concern about the level of dividend we'd be paying. So, this really how we came to our conclusion. Stewart, you want to add anything to that?","Stewart Ewing","It's really, Frank, just thinking through and looking at what the cash taxes would be in 2015 and the impact of that on free cash flow and on the dividend payout ratio, and again the opportunity to retire 8% or more of the shares between now and then and really help further. I mean it's accretive to free cash flow per share and it will reduce the aggregate dividend going forward.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Okay. Nothing on the operations side that's not trending the way you had been planning all along that makes you more concerned about in 2015 having to face of bigger dividend crisis?","Glen Post","No. That was not part of the decision. We bake this based on from we believe from the position of strength, Frank, and look into the future of the company also there is no plans. We don't have any major acquisitions on the radar had nothing to do with our decision, so it was strictly what we think the best for the long-term growth of this company.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Hi, guys. So, with the lower payout ratio, can you help us think about the opportunity that this creates in terms of spending more CapEx or maybe going more aggressively after growth initiatives like the video business which is going to drive a little more dilution upfront?","Stewart Ewing","Phil, So, if we bought shares back with the free cash flow then basically we will not have the additional capital to invest over and above what we are investing today unless we lever the company up, so I mean I guess that's the other thing. As part of this too, we increased the leverage ratio to somewhat less than three times or no more than three times.","But basically, we plan on using the free cash flow that's created as a result of the dividend reduction which is about $450 million a year to repurchase shares plus we'll add a use of about $1.1 billion of our free cash flow to repurchase shares as well.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Okay. And, so we should look at CapEx as being essentially flat for the next few years?","Stewart Ewing","That's our thinking now. Pretty flat, we could bring it down some, cut it off a little bit depending on. It's really based on the success of these new initiatives, I mean, what we think we can drive in terms of revenue and margins going forward.","Glen Post","Yes. Fiber-to-the-tower will start winding down, I guess 2014.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan","Okay. Can you help us think about your thought process on acquisitions here? I would think that given the hit you stock probably takes tomorrow that a stock-based acquisition might be a little tougher, but this buyback pool could leave some room for cash acquisitions instead how are you thinking of that?","Stewart Ewing","Right now, where we are focused on our key growth initiatives, we believe we have a lot of opportunities of organic growth with our broadband expansion and Fiber-to-the-tower work that managed hosting cloud services and our Prism TV services. So with all those, we are very comfortable. We do not need to make an acquisition in order to grow the company, to grow revenues and margins. That doesn\u2019t mean, we won't consider. We always have but we don\u2019t see a need to go out and acquire. We will look opportunistically at acquisition as a way to possibly grow the company faster but nothing that we feel we need to go out and have to go out and do it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Tim Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks, guys. For what it's worth, I think it's really ingenious and balance the restructuring here makes a lot of sense. Can you maybe just elaborate on the acquisitions? Are there any areas of divestitures that might make some sense for you? You haven't done any in a little while. Maybe, any areas of kind of obvious low hanging productivity improvements at this point? Thanks.","Glen Post","No, Tim. There is nothing significant. At least not that we could talk about right now. There are some obvious things on divestitures we have looked at before that we could do but nothing that we feel like would really improve our growth rate at this point in time or our margins. So, don't expect any divestitures today.","The low hanging fruit. I don\u2019t see, Stewart, you think is? I don't know anything that's out there that would drive productivity in the near term. The biggest thing I think is improve our growth. It's just the improvement of the economy. We are still seeing. Although we have had good result in our enterprise businesses this past year, we are still seeing a long decision making cycle out there.","Although we are encouraged somewhat as far as some of the successes we have had in the recent months, we are still concerned about the economy and are concerned that our potential customers have had over the fiscal cliff and the other regulatory issues that are out there, the debt saving, those kind of things. If we can get those out of the way, we are hopeful we will make through this economy turnaround. But if that happens and that's the biggest thing, we think, could drive faster growth for us.","Tim Horan - Oppenheimer","Then, lastly on the rating agencies. Are they focused on debt-to-EBITDA? Or is it interest coverage at this point? Maybe where would they like to see you with debt-the-EBITDA, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Debt-to-EBITDA. It is basically varies from agency to agency. I know Moody's has their release out. I think Fitch has their release out now. S&P release is probably out by now as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Goldman from Goldman Sachs.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Hey, thanks guys. Appreciate you taking the questions. I guess I will layoff on the buyback and dividend questions and we have hit a lot of that and just ask about the Savvis side of things or the hosting side of things. I know Stewart you mentioned that Savvis was up or the hosting was up about 8% year-over-year, but if I back out the announced contribution from the Ciber ITO, it looks as though that segment was pretty flat sequentially. So, I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about what you are seeing inside of the data center stuff at colo managed hosting side of things, and what you are seeing from the interest in savvisdirect and what impact that could have in 2013?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, Scott. The 8% year-over-year growth was without Ciber. But if you do, you are right. If you look sequentially from third to fourth quarter, basically the revenue was flat. That's really due to the things that we brought up on the call, the bankruptcies that we had during the quarter and that's really about it. We are hopeful that we had a good quarter in terms of bookings for fourth quarter.","Some of the softness that we saw in fourth quarter rather was related to third quarter bookings which were soft. So we are hopeful again with the good bookings in fourth quarter it will take a couple of quarters probably to turn that around but we had the best bookings in fourth quarter we had in four years basically. Jim, did you want to comment on that?","James Ousley","I would say that the key issues that affect 2013 is we have done a lot of work on integrating and enabling the CenturyLink network channels and so on and we will start to see that have positive revenue impact in the second half of the year. So you take that and you take the opportunities there with savvisdirect, which Glen mentioned, we are getting a positive reaction.","There, again, is a very large customer base that this appeals to, in the CenturyLink base that we believe will start to have some very positive impact in the third and fourth quarter and particularly in 2014 and 2015 it can be a very big increment to the overall hosting revenue.","The colo business is stable. It is kind of a managed business right now and directly related to investment. So we feel good. We had a good colo year but it was at a controlled level. So, managed hosting is the key. It is where the margins are at, where the value add is that and that's what we really need to drive on in 2013. We have plans in place to do that.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Great, and if I could just follow-up and I apologize if I missed this earlier but Stewart, if you could just talk about how much investments on the CapEx front you are spending on the data center side in '13 and how that compared to '12? I know you are pretty active on data center expansions in '12.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, we have got $325 million to $375 million in '13 and that was probably in '12. Let me grab that right quick. Yes, the total cash CapEx was about $318 million in '11.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks, guys.","Stewart Ewing","'12. I am sorry, in '12.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Okay, understood.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David Barden - Bank of America","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I will go back to the strategy change. I guess I wanted to give you guys maybe the opportunity. A lot of the questions have been okay. So Stewart, if nothing has changed in business from a year ago and we are looking at the same free cash flow in 2015 today that we are looking at before but what we have done is we have chosen the strategy now that's both led to debt downgrades and the 15% cut in the stock price but the argument is that we are going to create long-term value, but there is nothing on the acquisition table, there is nothing on the CapEx investment front that's going to be do anything different than what's been happening. So, what is the full argument now for CenturyLink now that you have done what you have done? How is CenturyLink better for the stockholders now?","Stewart Ewing","So, David, I think the first is that basically, we were going to get downgraded anyway. Based on the 2013 budgets and plan, short of cutting operating expenses or investment in areas that we think long-term will help us get to revenue and EBITDA stability. If we hadn't cut those, we couldn't have kept the investment grade rating. The other way to keep the investment grade rating would have been to cut the dividend and use that to pay debt back.","So, I mean we were going to get downgraded anyway. It would have been worse, I think, for us to cut the dividend and basically use that to pay debt back at this point. So looking at that, I guess as we have focused on 2013, we really started focusing on '15 and working through and trying to look at what taxes, cash taxes would potentially go to in '15 and that's when we realized as part of that that basically the dividend payout ratio was going to increase significantly in '15, if we didn't do something.","I guess we could have waited a year and a half or two years and see how that worked out but we decided it's better to be proactive and really try to buy stock back in the interim and keep investing in the business. Nothing has changed in the business really. Just keep investing in the business to stabilize and grow revenue and EBITDA.","We felt like we were better off going ahead reducing the dividend now, buying shares back which reduces the shares outstanding by the time we get to 2015 which helps us really again stabilize and be confident that we can continue with the dividend that we have moved to, which is more in line with our historical payout ratio in the last two to three years in '15 than we would have been had we not done this at this point.","Glen Post","I will just add, Dave that first of all, there is better visibility, as Stewart said, in 2015. Secondly, more confidence in our growth initiatives. We have seen those become real. We are where we made a choice to keep the dividend or increase the dividend and reduce our investment in the business, which we don't think is right. If we had not done this, we are looking at 2015 we think we are putting pressure on the stock price as we went into certainly in the '13 and '14, as we came forced to be cash taxpayer. So, you take all into consideration, this is the best strategy for our company long-term and for shareholders long-term. That's our view of it.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Nicole Black from Wells Fargo.","Nicole Black - Wells Fargo","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess as a fixed income analyst, what I want to ask about is could you take a minute to discuss your future debt issuance plans now that we are firmly in, in high yield status, are you going to continue to use the Qwest Corp entities to refinance Qwest Corp paper or will all future bonds come out of the CenturyLink parent box?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. So, Nicole, Qwest Corp and Embarq will remain investment grade at Fitch, basically that's in their release. Moody's basically indicated in their release that although they just put everything on review for downgrade that it was likely that Qwest Corp and Embarq would retain their investment grade rating, so we really believe we will retain the investment grade ratings at Embarq and Qwest Corp. We carry about $7.5 million of debt of the $20.5 million that we have outstanding is carried at Qwest Corp, so we will continue to use the Qwest Corp entity to refinance borrowings that come due at Qwest Corp.","Everything else our current plans are to as they were in the past really to refinance everything else that comes due you up at the parent company and of course that will be non-investment grade BB+ at Fitch, Moody's will come out with their rating but they indicated pretty strongly I think that the family rating would go down only one notch, so we will refinance at the parent company.","If you look at our debt maturities over the next three years over '13, '14 and '15, we only have about $725 million of maturities that will need to be refinanced at the parent company level. The remainder of the maturities that come due are at Qwest Corp, so we feel real comfortable with our financing plan going forward, our credit facility has paid down close to $300 million now from about $800 million at the end of the year and it's a $2 billion facility. We don't plan on drawing it down to more than $1 billion so that we keep at least $1 billion capacity on that facility just so that we will always have plenty of liquidity, so those are really our plans going forward.","Nicole Black - Wells Fargo","Okay, so if Embarq has a chance of keeping its status would you revive that as a potential issuing entity down the road?","Stewart Ewing","Nicole, we haven't really talked about that and we will need to think through that to see if that's a possibility. I mean, it would mean it would have to be another reporting entity and we will just have to see if it's worth the effort of doing that. We have about $3 billion of debt today a little less than $3 billion of debt today at the Embarq level. The first major maturity that comes up at Embarq is in 2016, a little over $1 billion, so we have some time to decide if we want to refinance at Embarq as well.","Nicole Black - Wells Fargo","Okay. Then last question. The covenants that are in place on the bank facility side, because that's good for another four years, the four turns at the parent level and 285, 235 tests on Qwest. Are those going to stay unchanged even with the ratings agency actions?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. Those stay unchanged even with the rating agency actions. We do have couple of covenants on QCII that bring back, but they are not material at all and really don't impact us.","Nicole Black - Wells Fargo","Okay. Well, it has been delightful covering you guys as long as I've been able to, so good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Donna Jaegers from D.A. Davidson.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson","Hi, I got a question for Karen Puckett, since she is in the background there. I was just curious given that Enterprise as such is your growth area, what Century is doing to change or to improve the go-to-market in the out-of-region market for CenturyLink?","Karen Puckett","Donna, the team had a great performance in 2012. We really want to continue to accelerate that. We have opportunities. We're very focused not only on the sales front, but also on the customer experience, because we believe that's a big differentiator for us right now against our competitors, so we are going to leverage that and get the tools and the resources so our sellers can be more productive in the upfront, so those two bookings are what we plan on doing differently.","Donna Jaegers - D.A. Davidson","And given that Comcast is coming at you guys heard in region offering twice the bandwidth to small business customers. What's your response there competitively?","Karen Puckett","Comcast is certainly a competitor, but I would say relative to the amount of the fiber that we have in end market, and the amount of fiber that we have already to buildings, we feel like we are set up pretty well. We are packaging that, so we have symmetrical capability into those buildings that very high speed Ethernet connections. That was our savvisdirect product in terms of computing as such, packaging, put us in a really strong position against our competitor be it Comcast or any of them.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Tom Seitz from Jefferies.","Tom Seitz - Jefferies","Yes. Thanks most of mine have been answered. I guess maybe could I ask for the little bit more color on how you feel like the savvisdirect product rollout has gone? Can you talk about how you are marketing it now that's it' out of beta? Are you systematically hitting your captive customers base any more white label deals just any color you can provide would be great?","Glen Post","I'll start and Jim may want to add to this, but up until through this month, through January and February, we have not done any advertising. Basically, it's all been just on the web and word-of-mouth and put it out on advertising in the internet world. We've been very pleased so far. We've also marketed some with our direct sales channels and they have been successful early on with that, we are seeing a lot of demand for the product, feel really good about it, and again with no advertising, we will began advertising heavier with direct mail with more or net-type advertising, and we expect to accelerate going forward. We believe it's going to be a very competitive product and again initial reaction has been very positive.","James Ousley","I would just add to cut two other data points. One, we are seeing very positive response on the private label. The white label product that we are looking at, we signed one order and we've got a lot of interest, so those could be pretty significant in the future.","The second is around the dedicated hosting environments low-end dedicated hosting environments that we are promoting. We are seeing very strong information and demand around those. Those take a little longer to sell because they're basically supporting a dedicated environment, but they're bigger ticket items so both of those are a very positive early on indications.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. If you will turn to slide 24, so we conclude today's call. We are pleased with the continued progress we made during the fourth quarter towards stabilizing our top line revenues and believe our continued investment in key strategic opportunities will help us continue to drive growth both, near-time and long-term.","Our strategic revenue growth continues to strengthen CenturyLink's competitive positions and our guidance reflects our expectation that our revenues from these strategic services will continue to grow in the months ahead. Demand from business customers for best network and hosted IT solutions remained strong. Also, the expansion of our Prism TV service and the recent launch of managed hosting and cloud services for small and mid-sized business customers will further strengthen our product portfolio and provide us additional revenue growth opportunities in 2013.","Throughout 2012, we made good progress on our key strategic initiatives and we believe these growth areas continue to strengthen our competitive position going into 2013. And, lastly, we believe the capital allocation changes we announced today will allow us to continue to invest in these strategic initiatives. They will help stabilize our top line revenue and strengthen our company's position long-term, while continuing to return significant cash to shareholders.","Thank you for joining our call today. We look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today.

The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for question-and-answer.","On slide two, you'll find our Safe Harbor language.

Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tony. Thank you for joining our call today as we discuss out first-quarter 2015 results of operations. We continue to make progress on a number of fronts during the first quarter, a few of which are our recent organizational realignment, the enhancement of broadband speeds across our network; also we made progress on the integration of DataGardens and the Cognilytics acquisition, further automation of our integrated network and hosting services solutions as well.","If you turn with me to slide five, overall we generated solid results for the first quarter. We continued to strengthen our ability to compete more effectively. We're beginning to see the benefits of our organization realignment implemented in late 2014 and we're confident that this streamlined operating structure positions us well to drive stronger sales results, strategic revenue growth, and operating efficiency over the long-term.","For the first quarter, operating cash flow exceeded our guidance primarily due to lower employee related expenses and favorable one-time items. I'm pleased with our overall efforts to control cost, as we remain focused on reducing spend in legacy areas while continuing to invest in our growth areas.","Total operating revenue was below the midpoint of our guidance range primarily due to lower data integration revenues related to customer premise equipment sales and core revenue is just below the midpoint of guidance, as hosting revenue came in lower than expected partially due to an unfavorable foreign currency impact and customer credits.","As anticipated, we did experience weaker large business sales in the first quarter, primarily due to our organizational realignment that resulted in customer account reassignments to various individual sellers as well as the restructuring of our sales force. However, we are pleased with improving sales following sales momentum we saw coming out of the quarter.","Now turning to slide six, we're continuing to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting, and IT services to provide solutions for our customers. Also, we are focused on executing on several strategic priorities that we believe are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company. The first of these is to grow our business solutions. As part of our reorganization, we further integrated and restructured our go-to-market model in the first quarter as we consolidated network and hosting sales and marketing organizations.","We are confident that this approach will drive long-term sales efficiency across our full portfolio of capabilities by focusing on solution selling and customer acquisition. We continue to drive strategic revenue growth of meeting business and government demand for MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the quarter. Additionally our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise solutions continued to gain traction and we are seeing increasing customer interest for both small and large business customers.","These managed services help free customers from the day-to-day management of their network and related services as well as freedom from equipment issues. We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of our GPON footprint in the months ahead.","For example, the GPON deployment along with the Managed Office product offering and an enhanced sales effort were key drivers of our solid improvement in SMB sales year-over-year. We had GPON available to approximately 390,000 business locations as of March 31 and we expect to continue to see upside in this segment with our plans to expand our business GPON footprint by more than 100,000 businesses by year-end 2015.","We continue to deploy faster broadband speeds through a combination of fiber deployment and speed enhancements on our existing network to help us more broadly compete in the marketplace. We've also made solid progress with our development of software-defined networks and network functions virtualization and the associated automated programming interfaces or APIs to the related support systems.","We have commercially deployed virtualized network-based security services, content delivery network, and cloud firewall services across a portion of our data center footprint with plans for further deployment in the months ahead, which we believe positions CenturyLink as one of the leaders in both SDN and NFV enablement.","We also continue to roll out enhancements to our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP trunking services. In addition, we plan to continue to add new capabilities to Managed Office that we believe will provide unparalleled simplicity for SMB customers looking for a full outsourced solution for their network, hosting and cloud applications as well as associated equipment and maintenance.","Turning to wholesale services, revenues remain under pressure due to continued low-bandwidth data service disconnects and network grooming, along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. As you are aware, secular trends in wholesale have resulted in revenue pressure from increased network grooming and the migration from low-speed private line services to fiber-enabled Ethernet services by wireless carriers and wireline customers.","Fortunately, we have had success in mitigating some of this revenue pressure by expanding our fiber-based wireless backhaul services. At the end of the first quarter, we enabled fiber to over 21,800 towers within our operating footprint, and we're expanding our focus on Ethernet services and leveraging our hosting products, including colocation, having recently won a 2-plus-megawatt data center contract with a major international telecom carrier.","Before I move into the consumer discussion, I would like to give you a little more detail about how we view our cloud and hosting results and how we look at that part of our business. We are beginning to see improved results in our colocation business with a good year-over-year increase in colocation sales results. We remain focused on improving those results, and expect to continue to see good performance in our colocation business as we have nearly 40% of our sellable store space currently available across our total data center footprint. We are also seeing increased utilization of our new-generation CenturyLink Cloud platform, almost doubling the revenue driven from that platform over the last 12 months, and we expect that velocity to continue.","I want to be clear, though, that while we are seeing better results in some parts of our cloud and hosting business, overall our results are not what we expect them to be. CenturyLink Cloud, which is the platform we acquired in the Tier 3 transaction just over a year ago, enables a wide range of service and is growing, but it does not yet provide the full range of services required to serve all of our large enterprise customer needs.","We'll continue to invest in CenturyLink Cloud both through internal development and through service-enhancing acquisitions such as DataGardens and the most recently announced Orchestrate transaction. The consistent enhancement of the platform has received good reviews from our customers, which is reflected in both revenue growth and in positive customer surveys. We plan to make the CenturyLink Cloud platform the long-term focus of our cloud and hosting strategy.","That said, we have not performed as well as we should have with respect to the services that are supported by our legacy cloud and hosting platforms. We're near completion of some basic tool enhancements and automation development for these platforms, which we believe will help drive increased sales across all these legacy platforms. Although we did experience churn from some large colocation customers that had an unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates during the quarter, we believe the primary issue here is really one of focus and execution, rather than product capabilities.","As we move into the remainder of 2015, we are renewing our focus on driving better results into the legacy cloud and managed services platforms, and we expect to see improvement as we move into the second quarter and beyond.","As you all know, the demand for cloud and managed service offerings is expected to continue to rapidly expand. We believe in these growth projections. And while we have not consistently generated results we've expected in this area, we continue to very strongly believe in the opportunity and the assets we have to take advantage of it. We believe our recent acquisitions and investments position us well over the long-term to capture our share of the significant growth market in the months ahead.","To summarize, we're in the process of establishing what we believe is a unique position in the market to offer enterprise customers highly scalable, secure and differentiated offerings that bring together a set of highly automated network, hybrid cloud, security and value creating IT and data analytic services that enterprise customers really need. We believe we'll be able to demonstrate the power of our network and hybrid cloud offerings in the months ahead.","Turning on to slide seven, in the Consumer segment we continue to see good results in those markets where we have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. In our early GPON markets like Omaha, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. We continue to expand our gigabit footprint to residential customers in select locations in 10 cities, including some of our larger markets and we expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 residential consumers by the year-end 2015 and followed by further expansion in 2016 and beyond.","During the first quarter, we also expanded Prism TV service to an additional 73,000 homes within the existing markets, ending the quarter with over 2.4 million addressable homes. We also added 8,000 Prism customers during the quarter, but these adds were negatively impacted by price increase implemented in January to cover content cost increases.","As of quarter end, we had more than 249,000 Prism TV customers representing a penetration rate of 10.2%. We anticipate expanding Prism TV service to approximately 425,000 additional households through the remainder of 2015 and we expect to reach more than 2.8 million total addressable households by year-end.","Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. Also we continue to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenues, while we continue to invest in areas that are driving growth. We have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We are using a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and software-as-a-service solution across our internal IT operations that we are selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and other efficiencies for our company.","Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our process and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool to increase our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back-office systems.","In summary, I believe we are well-positioned in our markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We're also investing in an expanded unified distribution structure and we have a laser focus on continuing to improve our revenue trends in the months ahead.","Now I will turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and second-quarter 2015 guidance.","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Glen. I will spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. Beginning on slide nine, I will review some highlights from our first quarter results. I will be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules.","Operating revenues were $4.45 billion on a consolidated basis, a 1.9% decline from first quarter 2014 operating revenues. Core revenue which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue was $4.06 billion for the first quarter, a decrease of 1.3% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and represent 52% of our total revenues compared to 50% a year ago.","Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data, and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. We added more than 35,000 high-speed Internet customers and approximately 8,000 Prism TV customers during the quarter. Additionally, we generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.74 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39%.","As Glen mentioned, we exceeded our operating cash flow guidance as we had lower cash expenses than anticipated. Expenses were below expectations due primarily to lower employee-related costs, along with lower CPE costs related to our data integration revenues and approximately $30 million of favorable one-time items during the quarter.","Free cash flow of $849 million for the quarter was very strong. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.67, coming in $0.06 above our guidance range. As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, onto the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 4.5 million shares during the quarter for an investment of $170 million. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period outlined earlier.","Now turning to slide 10, first quarter 2015 operating revenues declined $87 million or 1.9% compared to first quarter 2014, as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues, due primarily to access line losses and lower data integration revenues. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength again in high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth business data services, and Prism TV. Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the decline in first quarter 2015 was 16% lower than the first quarter revenue decline a year ago.","Moving to slide 11 on our Business segment, in the first quarter the Business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $78 million or 2.8% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.8% to $1.6 billion from first quarter 2014, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength, which was largely offset by the continued decline of low-bandwidth data services and lower hosting revenues.","We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer market, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium-size business space to improve market share and drive further growth. Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.4% from first quarter 2014, due to primarily declining access lines. Total Business segment expenses decreased slightly from the year-ago period, driven by lower CPE cost. Our segment margin of 45% declined from 45.8% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenue.","On slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $70 million or 11% year-over-year compared to first quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. Low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in first quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $88 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers' network grooming efforts and migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year.","We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects and grooming. Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by an unfavorable foreign currency impact of $5 million and lower non-recurring revenue compared to the year-ago period. In the first quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $35 million or 20% compared to first quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales.","Now turning to slide 13, in our Consumer segment, Consumer generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues on 0.8% decline from first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.1% year-over-year to $738 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price adjustments. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 6% from first quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price adjustments. Operating expenses were flat compared to the same period a year ago as lower employee-related costs offset the higher Prism TV cost.","Now turning to slide 14, for second quarter 2015 we expect operating revenues of $4.41 billion to $4.6 billion, and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion, both of which are expected to be flat to slightly down from first quarter 2015. Our operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, a decrease compared to first quarter 2015, primarily due to higher employee-related expenses, the impact of the continued decline in higher-margin legacy revenue, and the $30 million of favorable one-time expense items I mentioned earlier that occurred during the first quarter. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.64 in second quarter 2015 compared to the $0.67 in first quarter of 2015. Our full year guidance that we provided in February for full year 2015 remains unchanged.","That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. First question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, Stewart, just with respect to first quarter results and then the second quarter midpoint guidance and then comparing that to your full-year guidance, splitting it up equally, it looks like revenue would have to move into the $4.5 billion to $4.6 billion range to kind of get to the midpoint of the full-year number. Could you talk about the moving parts that are going to get us from that $4.435 billion to that $4.5 billion number that seems to be embedded in the full-year guidance would be...? And the second part of that question would be, if we are looking at an upward swing in revenue growth sequentially through the back part of the year, could you talk about what the drivers for 2016 would be to kind of keep that going? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, so, David, you're right. There is somewhat of a hockey stick in the second half of the year, which was really implied more or less in the first quarter guidance that we gave as well. And really, there are three areas that we think that we'll see improvements on, really starting somewhat in the second quarter, but then more so in the last half of the year. One is, we \u2013 as Glen mentioned, we expect the reorganization that we did and the sales results from that reorganization to improve during the year, as we saw some improvement in the month of March over January and February. So we expect to see continued improvement there and that to be one of the items that hopefully will push our revenue in the second half of the year. Secondly, I mentioned surprise adjustments, so we'll have price adjustments that we put in that will basically help continue to improve revenue during the year.","And then also, we think the latter half of the year, we will really get through most of the grooming that we're seeing from some of the other carriers in terms of wholesale, particularly on the private line side. And we're seeing fewer tower builds which means that basically we're not seeing migration from the copper circuits to Ethernet that we experienced last year, too. So we expect to see a little bit of that. In terms of 2016, we're hopeful that the momentum we have from a sales standpoint going into 2016 will help us overcome the \u2013 to the extent we don't have price adjustments in 2016 that equal 2015 which we don't know yet, we're not sure what sort of pricing adjustments we'll have next year. But to the extent we don't have those pricing adjustments equal to this year, we're hopeful that the sales momentum would continue to carry us through the tougher comps that we would have in the first part of this year related to the price adjustments that we made.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And David, this is Glen, I just had a couple comments. The one is talking about 2016, we expect greater sales force efficiency as we get through the next few months and really transform our sales force to a little different go-to-market strategy with the solution selling that we're working toward with all of our IP products and cloud hosting, also regular network products. Also, additional product rollout, as I mentioned, we're expanding our GPON footprint during this year, so we'll have that really rolled out. We're expanding our Prism to close to 500,000 additional households past this year. And then the Cloud hosting product advancements we're working on, we think, are really significant and can drive a lot of potential sales growth there.","And then bringing in our Big Data, Advanced Analytics \u2013 the Cognilytics acquisition is driving a lot of activity for us, lot of interest throughout the business community for those services, and along with those IP services, we're not just providing the Cloud service, we're providing convergence to the Cloud and software support, application support and just the overall increased broadband speeds that we expect to roll out over the next 12 months.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Awesome. Sounds great, guys. Congrats. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. You were active in the market buying back stock this quarter. Can you just update us on what you have left in the current authorization and how you're thinking about next steps after that given the potential cash tax impact next year? And any potential M&A that might be out there? And then if you could also just comment on your thoughts on the CAF-II proposals from the FCC? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. So, Simon, first on the share buyback, basically through \u2013 a couple of days ago, I guess through the shares that we've settled as of really yesterday, we had repurchased about 11.6 million shares under the existing program and spent about $439 million, so there's $561 million remaining of the $1 billion program that we had. And we continue to expect to opportunistically buy shares back and would expect still to complete the program within the 24-month period from which we started it, which we started it in February or so \u2013 May actually, May of 2014. So by May of 2016, we would expect to complete that.","Beyond that, we haven't really talked with the board about the next step from the standpoint of returning cash to shareholders, although as you point out, we will see an increase, a significant increase in cash taxes or expect to see a significant increase in cash taxes in 2016, which we'll use quite a bit of the free cash flow that we've had. In terms of the CAF-II proposal, of course we've just got that \u2013 I guess the FCC just released that a week or so ago and started the 120-day clock running basically, so we have until August 27 to make the FCC aware of which of the 37 states that we have the option of the right of first refusal in to take up to $514 million is what was allocated to us.","So we have started the process now that we know the census blocks that are included. We started the process of reviewing the capital expenditures that would be required to get the 10 down\/1 up service, and I would imagine we will take most of the time allotted to come to some conclusion as to how much of the CAF II monies that we won't accept.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Do you have any sort of initial \u2013 do you think you'll take most of it, or it's still too early to say?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","It's really still too early to say, Simon.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. First, a question on the strategic services within the Business segment. You explained the pressure that you saw on the hosting side and the low-bandwidth services, but can you provide more color on why we saw the high-bandwidth revenues come down sequentially and how you think about that piece going \u2013 tracking from here on? And the second question on the other strategic services, it's been very lumpy, but you had a big quarter this time. What was in there? Is there any one-timer and how do you expect that going forward? Thank you.","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yes. So, Batya, we had a re-class from strategic services to legacy services in the first quarter that in the aggregate was about $10 million. About half of it was related to basically network services that Savvis had been providing. And we decided that as we merge the sales force as we looked at it closer and decided that it really should be in legacy revenue. And then the other was just some other strategic revenue that we found that we really needed to re-class to legacy too, so that was about $10 million of it.","And then also, the SAB 104 deferral revenue, I guess we didn't have as many one-time sales in the first quarter as we had in the first quarter a year ago, and that basically \u2013 the way we account for it reduced the strategic revenue somewhat.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Maybe putting it all together, how should we think about the strategic services within the Business segment trending from here on?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, so I mean, we would expect basically based on the sales effort that the business strategic revenues should hopefully trend better going forward. And then also, as Glen mentioned, the Prism build-out that we have in process and the GPON rollout and the higher-bandwidth services that we'll be providing to our high-speed internet customers both on the Business and Consumer side, that all of that should help drive those strategic revenue lines over the course of the year.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. One just quick clarification and sort of strategic question. You mentioned on the hosting side down a little bit because of FX and some lower non-recurring. Can you quantify that, how much of it was the FX, and then what exactly was the impetus for the non-recurring? And then, as you look out at M&A going forward, how should we think about your appetite for various assets and particularly landline assets? Are those as interesting to you as they were in the past or you see \u2013 looking for other opportunities?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, so, Frank, the foreign exchange was $5 million during the quarter negative, and that was mostly the British pound. And then, we had about $4 million of lower non-recurring sales, and it was just an opportunity that we had in the first quarter of 2014 that we didn't have \u2013 with a partner, that we really didn't have again in the first quarter 2015.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Frank, regarding the access line-type acquisitions, we are \u2013 as I've said before, we're less interested in those today just because of the difficulty in having those revenue streams that would drive growth for us. It is difficult, as you know. We believe we've assembled a really strong group of assets that form a really good foundation from which we can drive attractive growth in the months ahead and years ahead.","That being said, we're always looking for opportunities to accelerate our growth and strengthen our position in the market. We don't believe we have any gaping holes we need to fill in our product portfolio or in our key asset base. But if opportunities arise in which we can enhance our Cloud hosting offering, expand our fiber reach, our fiber access or accelerate our growth profile, we would certainly consider those opportunities. As you know, we've made some small acquisitions that have enhanced our hosting and Cloud capabilities and IT service capabilities in recent months. They were small, but all those fit very well strategically with where we're headed. But any opportunity we look at would only be evaluated under our very disciplined approach, acquisition process.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead.","Tudor Mustata - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. This is Tudor for Mike. Just a question on the competitive environment, have you guys seen any incremental competition from Level 3 and tw telecom now they've merged? And any commentary you guys have on the hosting and managed hosting market?","Karen A. Puckett - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Michael (sic) [Tudor], this is Karen Puckett. In terms of Level 3, I would say we continue to do very well on our high-bandwidth capability to our customers, so we have not seen a slip in our win rates and continue to take share from many carriers. So, we feel good about that. And on the second question \u2013 second question was around the hosting, managed hosting, I would say that the issue there is more in terms of our focus versus competition. And clearly on the public Cloud side, that continued to grow, AWS, Microsoft, but that's not \u2013 we are not a pure play, we really are focused on that broad hybrid proposal and what we see. And if you look at the kinds of wins that we're winning from global to midsize, we've got a product portfolio with our network that provides a little latency with our collocation and then with our dedicated and public Cloud that allows really any size customer to scale up or scale down. And we can handle the enterprise grade and security capability that's required.","So when I look at our wins and when I look at our funnel \u2013 what's in our funnel, it's really encouraging in terms of the opportunity we have in front of us.","Tudor Mustata - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Actually, really just one tonight. I was curious if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on the OpCo\/PropCo structuring or considerations for that?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Assistant Secretary","Yeah, Mike, so this is Stewart. We really haven't changed our view from before. The spin-off just occurred a week or two ago. Basically, we continue to see a lot of opportunity to create value for shareholders by using the assets that we have today and would be concerned about those assets being in someone else's hands \u2013 another group of shareholders basically with different interests. However, we'll continually evaluate the best ways to try to deliver long-term shareholder value, so as such, we'll monitor their performance over the course of the next couple quarters or so and we'll see how much value is created there and then we'll weigh that against what we believe our potential downsides associated with using that structure.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference over to Mr. Glen Post for closing marks.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Sayed. In conclusion, overall we are pleased with our solid first quarter operating and financial results. And we are confident that the reorganization and the investments we're making continue to position us to effectively compete in the marketplace and drive revenue growth from our strategic products and services in the months and years ahead. So thank you all for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

We are pleased with our first quarter results and we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts.","Starting on slides five, I\u2019d like to begin with some highlights from the quarter. We continue to generate solid operating results from subscriber metrics. Our annual rate of access line loss improved to only 5.7% in the first quarter 2013 from 6.4% a year ago.","Also we achieved better than expected broadband net ads of 66,700 in the quarter. This is obviously strong performance for the quarter. However, we do expect broadband subscriber growth to be significantly lower in the second quarter due to normal seasonality in our industry.","During the quarter, we added 13,400 Prism TV customers ending the period with 120,000 subscribers. We also believe video is an important product for our residential customers and we continue to rollout the service to new markets.","From a business markets perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers across the company for network and hosting services in the quarter. Our business strategic revenue grew over 6% in the first quarter 2013 compared to the same period a year ago, and we continue to see high demand for Ethernet and DSL and Wavelength services as they grew over 15% year-over-year.","In early January we announced and implemented an organizational realignment that merge our entire retail consumer and business network services operations in to a single operating group led by our Chief Operating Officer, Karen Puckett.","The key objective in this realignment was to ensure that we provided a more consistent go-to-market strategy and an improved end-to-end service deliver experience to business customers both in and out of region.","During the first quarter 2013, cash expenses declined 3% from the same period a year ago driven by lower personnel related costs, partially offset by higher colocation, managed hosting and network expenses.","Finally, I\u2019m pleased with the strong progress we made on the share repurchase program we announced in February. Through May 2013 we repurchased 19.2 million shares, a 3% of our outstanding common stock for a total of $682 million.","We repurchased shares aggressively over past few months and we expect to opportunistically buy stock going forward. We do expect to complete the $2 billion repurchase by February of 2015.","If you turn to slide 6, I\u2019ll provide an update on our key strategic initiatives starting with broadband expansion enhancement. We continue to make significant investments in this area, with a 67,000 high-speed internet customers added in the first quarter, we now serve more than 5.91 million broadband subscribers.","Also as a result of our network investment and enhancement broadband speed availability is continue to improve, over 70% of enabled access lines received speeds of 6 megabits of higher, over 60% of enabled lines received 10 megabits or higher, 30% -- 32% have high -- have speeds of 20 megabits or higher and nearly 15% has speed of 40 megabits or higher.","As part of our broadband initiative, we are also focused on expanding our Ethernet and MPLS services for our business customers. During the quarter, we continued to expand our Ethernet over Copper footprint more than 3,300 of our central offices are now capable of providing Ethernet in our network. We expect to continue making investments in our network to enhance speed capabilities require to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets.","We recently announced the launch of 1 gigabit service pilot in Omaha, which will reach approximately 48,000 addressable homes and project is completed in the fourth quarter of this year.","We will carefully evaluate the success of this pilot before determining further deployment this advanced technology. We will be considering such factors as positive community support competitive compared to the marketplace. Our return to investment in these areas among other key factors help us make decisions regarding future investments in fiber to the power technology. ","Turning to slide seven, our Prism TV service continues to perform well and represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV service and the markets where we offer the service. We added 13,400 Prism TV subscribers during the first quarter for a total of 120,000 subscribers. We now have a penetration of nearly 10% across the market where service is available. Over 50% of the customers added were new customers to CenturyLink. ","These customers continue to have a high rate of broadband attachment I believe about 94% attachment rate in the first quarter of the year. In addition, we continue to enhance our IPTV features by introducing new functionality and applications, including expansion of our TV Everywhere capabilities, our video-on-demand library and our recent successful trial of wireless set-top boxes. We expect to continue to expand our Prism TV footprint as well as drive additional subscriber growth. ","As announced last quarter, Phoenix was the first legacy Qwest market to receive Prism TV service. Everybody sales there are favorable. In the first quarter we also soft launched the service in Colorado Springs, and while we previously indicated we expect to launch Phoenix plus one additional market this year, we now also expect soft launch Prism TV service in Omaha during the second quarter with our fiber to the prim technology offering there. ","Continuing on to slide eight, there are two strategic, initiatives investing fiber builds of new towers in our service areas is economically feasible. During the first quarter we completed approximately 800 fiber to the tower builds for a total of over 15,500 across our footprint. We currently expect to complete a total of 4000 to 5000 builds by end of 2013. We believe our fiber-to-the-tower program have solidified our wholesale access revenue for the long term and assist in the stabilization of our revenue trends. ","As we have discussed with you before, we are experiencing some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper based DS1 facilities to Fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we anticipate that wireless bandwidth growth will result in expansion of Ethernet consumption reversing the current revenue compression by early 2014. On average, bandwidth capacity of initial fiber-based connections is increasing which mitigate some of the transition revenue compression we had expected.","Now moving to slide 9, in managed hosting and cloud services, we saw some weakness in first quarter data hosting revenue growth due to soft third quarter 2012 new sales, also due to foreign exchange currency impacts as well as the impact of declining computing storage costs. However we continue to believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on long term secular growth opportunities in this space. We have developed and are expanding our strong product offering for businesses of all sizes. ","We continue to build upon solid momentum in the fourth quarter 2012 as new sales were also strong again this quarter. Cross-sell opportunities for hosting product across the company continue to be strong. The sales of hosting services to business network customers steadily are growing. With our savvisdirect, we\u2019ve updated our bundled solutions to introduce cloud product to additional business customers throughout all of our sales channels. We also continue to invest to increase data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity.","In the first quarter we expanded capacity in three data centers adding approximately 15,000 square feet of saleable floor space. For full year 2013 we expect to add to a total of nearly 90,000 saleable square feet. In April, Savvis is recognized as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for managed hosting North America, and we believe another confirmation of CenturyLink\u2019s leadership position in managed hosting. ","Now to slide 10, before handing the call over to Stewart, let me say I am pleased with our first quarter results. We continue to improve our top line revenue trend and we continue to believe we will improve the year over year revenue trends for full year 2013 and reached revenue stability in 2014.","We achieved strong high-speed internet and Prism TV subscriber growth. And the focused investments we have made in our key strategic initiatives have positively contributed to strategic revenue growth and continue to improve our topline revenue trend.","We believe the soft launch of Prism TV into additional markets in the first half of 2013 and planned subsequent commercial launches later this year will position us well to grow video subscribers during 2013 and beyond.","Also with the realignment of our reporting structure, we continue to improve our go-to-market approach and end-to-end service delivery model for business customers. And with the launch of savvisdirect in late 2012, our managed hosting and cloud services portfolio is now positioned to address the data hosting needs of customers of all size. Additionally, our increased focus on accountability across the organization to sell data hosting solutions is leading to improve our cross-sell opportunity.","With that, I will turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stewart?","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I will spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter and full year 2013 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Turning to slide 12, I will be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. With that let\u2019s move to our first quarter results.","As you can see we generated solid operating revenues and cash flows. Operating revenues were $4.51 billion on a consolidated basis, at the top of our guidance for the quarter. It represents a 2.1% decline from first quarter 2012 operating revenues.","Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 47% of total revenue from 45% in the first quarter a year ago due to growth in strategic products such as high-speed internet, high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and Managed Hosting Services.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.76, exceeding the top end of our guidance by $0.04, which was primarily as a result of our first quarter operating expenses being lower than we had anticipated.","As we\u2019ve discussed on prior earnings call, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.","Total cash operating expenses decreased from first quarter 2012 to first quarter 2013. This decline was primarily the result of lower personnel related costs which were partially offset by higher data hosting and network costs.","We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.93 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 42.8%. Additionally, we generated $1 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash taxes paid, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income. Our strong free cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to slide 13, our year-over-year revenue declined 2.1% from first quarter of 2012. This rate of decline represents a 60-basis point improvement over the 2.7% rate of decline in first quarter of 2012. Operating revenues compared to pro forma revenues for first quarter of 2011.","The decline in first quarter 2013 operating revenues compared to first quarter 2012 was primarily a result of growth in strategic revenues that was more than offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use and the impact of a lower universal service revenue contribution factor that has passed through revenue recorded in our other revenue line item. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed internet, high-bandwidth business data services and data hosting services.","Slide 14 highlights the revised reporting structure. In early January, we announced an organizational realignment combining our business, sales and operations functions that previously resided in enterprise markets, network services and regional markets organization, into one organization which is led by our Chief Operating Officer, Karen Puckett.","We believe this change positions us to better serve our business customers by streamlining our end-to-end service delivery, supporting sales of network services to our enterprise customers by creating one cohesive organization. So beginning this quarter, the first quarter and going forward, we are now reporting the following four segments: consumer, business, wholesale and data hosting services. ","Now turning to slide 15, I will discuss each of our operating segments beginning with the consumer segment first. Consumer generated $1.51 billion in operating revenues which represents a decline of 3.4% over first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.4% year over year to $620 million. Our legacy services revenues for the segment declined 8.7% for first quarter 2012 due primarily to a continued decline in access line and long distance revenues partially mitigated by implementation of access recovery charge in July of 2012. Expenses declined $41 million or 7.2% during the first quarter compared to the same period a year ago driven mainly by lower employee related expenses which were partially offset by higher Prism TV costs. ","Moving to slide 16, our business segment generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues during the first quarter which were in line with the same year ago period. First quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased by 6.4% to $615 million from the first quarter 2012 driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength.","Excluding private line services, strategic revenue grew nearly 12% from year ago. Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 4.6% from first quarter 2012 due primarily to continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues, partially again mitigated by implementation of the access recovery charge in mid-year 2012. Total segment expenses declined approximately $30 million or 3% driven by lower employee and bad debt expense partially offset by higher facility costs.","Turning to slide 17, our wholesale segment generated $907 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 5.7% from first quarter 2012. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $573 million, down 1.5% from first quarter 2012 as declining low speed transport services revenue offset growth in Ethernet services and data bandwidth capacity expansion by wireless carriers. Our legacy revenues in this segment declined by 12% to $334 million reflecting the continued decline in access in long distance minutes of use and the implementation of lower access rates on the cap order rate step-up. ","Operating expenses for the quarter were $274 million, 12% below the same period from the prior year, driven by lower personnel related costs, lower access expense and some favorable one-time access settlements during the quarter. ","Now moving to slide 18 in our data hosting segment which includes all colocation, managed hosting, cloud services and hosting related network services revenue for customers of all sizes, this segment generated $334 million in operating revenues representing an increase of 7.7% from first quarter 2012 revenues of $310 million. The growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 4.3% in colocation revenues and 20% increase in managed hosting cloud services revenues. ","First quarter 2013 revenues include approximately $15 million of revenue contribution from the Ciber IT outsourcing assets acquired in October 2012. Excluding this revenue, managed hosting revenue grew by approximately 6% year-over-year. As Glen previously said, year-over-year revenue growth based several headwinds this quarter, including soft new sales in third quarter 2012, foreign currency exchange impact and price compression driven by declining compute and storage costs. In total, these items lowered first quarter 2013 revenues by approximately $8 million compared to the same period a year ago. ","Data hosting operating expenses were $264 million in the first quarter compared to $231 million in the first quarter 2012. This increase of 14% is driven by added data center expansion operations and sales and marketing headcount to support revenue growth, including headcount for savvisdirect and enabling sales channels along with expenses related to the acquisition of the Ciber ITO assets, not present in the prior-year period.","Now turning to slide 19, we provide our second quarter and full year 2013 guidance. For second quarter 2013, we expect operating revenues of $4.49 billion to $4.54 billion and operating cash flow between $1.82 and $1.86 million and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.63 to $0.68 per share.","Our anticipated sequential decline in second quarter operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS compared with first quarter results is primarily due to one higher seasonal expenses that we typical incur in the second quarter each year including annual merit adjustments. The total of that equates to about $0.04 a share and normal legacy revenue decline, partially offset by continued expected growth in strategic revenue which in aggregate is a decline of about $0.015 EPS and cost related to our continued investments in key initiatives and increased marketing and timing of some of our branding expenditures expected to be about $0.03 during the quarter.","For the full year 2013, our operating revenues, capital expenditures and free cash flow guidance remains the same as we provided last quarter. However, we have increased our full-year 2013 operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS guidance primarily as a result of our strong first quarter results and share repurchases through the end of the quarter.","We now expect operating cash flow to be in the $7.35 billion to $7.55 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.75 per share. It's also important to note that we\u2019d expect our 2013 operating revenues compared to our 2012 operating revenues to reflect one, approximately a $35 million decline in data integration revenues due to anticipated lower cost from premise equipment sales. And secondly, approximately $45 million lower other revenues due primarily to the lower USF contribution factor anticipated this year versus 2012.","That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I\u2019ll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David Barden - Bank of America","Hi guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Nice quarter to start off the year. A couple of questions if I could, first, Stewart, the buyback was very aggressive. You\u2019ve got about a third of the $2 billion buyback that you budgeted over the neck over the two years behind you now. When you say opportunistic, should we imagine that what you're really going for is a strict $1 billion of buyback this year, a strict $1 billion of buyback next year or if the opportunity presents itself, how aggressive would you be prepared to be within the context of the full $2 billion buyback authorization?","And then second, just on the data center business, we've seen some very strong results from a lot of the data center companies out there. You talked about this quarters softness in terms of sequential growth was really in part a function of softness and billings in the third quarter. You saw strength in the fourth quarter. You saw strength this quarter in terms of bookings. Should we be expecting a nice acceleration starting in 2Q and if so, could you kind of size up, what kind of growth we should be expecting from that unit? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","So David, I\u2019ll answer the first question. So we were aggressive and by being opportunistic, I mean, we will potentially spend more than half of the program in 2013. It really just depends on the stock price and the opportunity to accumulate more shares at lower prices. So I think we\u2019re pretty aggressive. We\u2019re not going to continue in all likelihood at the same pace that we did. We don\u2019t expect to get -- we still expect to get the program done within the two-year period that we announced. But we would expect just to probably in the year at a little bit higher than $1 billion. But again just really dependent upon the opportunity.","Glen Post","I will comment on that, to speak to the question, it\u2019s like a question a little more detailed. But we feel that the first quarter hopefully in the low point for our data hosting sales, helped along the momentum we believe in our network group for cross-selling opportunities, we have a new Savvis Direct product coming out and we pointed out, the sales were strong in the fourth and first quarter. So we feel good about where we are headed here. We don\u2019t disclose exactly our growth target here but Jeff can address some things we're doing here and we are optimistic about the rest of the year. Jeff?","Jeff Von Deylen","Again in the third quarter that books for that new sales sold in that quarter was a low point. I think that the good news is Q4 and Q1 our new sales were on our plan and we are about 30% higher than that Q3 low point. One of our other big initiatives in 2013 is leveraging the CenturyLink channels, got significant sellers, 400, about 5000 enterprise customers that we are really -- there is some early good signs, a good program got really launched at the end of fourth quarter, early first quarter and the results in Q1 were pretty positive, we were about 10% up from our Q4 sales. It gives us confidence in terms of our go forward -- this Q1 number is the low point and we will grow sequentially from there. I think the one time -- the headwinds we have are currency and then we talked about the technology migration as some of our customers migrate from discrete hosting to more cloud based services. There is some price erosion pressure. ","Our team there is very focused on catering those customers, retaining up and we will grow with them. So that\u2019s the kind of the key points that we are trying to execute on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS","Wanted to ask about consumer margin, the 65% was the level that we haven\u2019t seen in over two years and despite that you have more IPTV in the business, I assume that is slower margin business. Given the headcount reductions that you announced, should we assume that this is a sustainable level going forward or do you anticipate some pressure going forward?","Stewart Ewing","No Batya, we really just anticipate some pressure going forward in the consumer segments that we\u2019re growing our margins down somewhat, closer to really -- in the low 60s probably. We\u2019re really just in the second quarter starting to roll out the Prism TV and start to incur some expenses there. We have additional markets as Glen mentioned that we will be rolling out during the year. So we expect to see increase this quarter with some of the strategic products including Prism which are in the consumer segment. So we expect to see that margins to come down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Can you talk a little bit about your business services organization and what sort of benefit that you are seeing from that year to date?","Karen Puckett","Frank, Karen, good afternoon. Business services, so the realignment has been very helpful in terms of a cohesive go to market and in particular some real efficiencies in the marketing organization, in terms of one product roadmap, getting the efficiencies out of one platform like (inaudible) making sure that we are leveraging all the capabilities across all the sub-segments within the business, in terms of enterprise, SMB. And so that\u2019s been very beneficial. And then geographically getting aligned so that there is a better coordination and there's never enough feet on the street. So it\u2019s actually better utilization of the sales organization. Really encouraged, I think the team is really encouraged and we are looking forward to the second quarter.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Okay. Any margin impact or anything we should expect going forward, or just more incremental blocking and tackling smaller steps?","Karen Puckett","Right now, it is just incremental blocking and tackling.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Karen Puckett","And we will take it from there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Mark Warren from Morgan Stanley.","John Mark Warren - Morgan Stanley","Hi, there. I was just wondering if could comment on any changes you have seen from your business customers in terms of economic outlook or decisions cycles, and then also if you are seeing or foresee any impacts from sequestration in our government business?","Glen Post","Yeah. We think the economy is pretty fragile still. However, in the business side, we are seeing still strong demand for business service, IT services. We had mixed signals. We have the housing starts improving. At the same time, you get the sequestration as you mentioned. We got the higher taxes from the first of the year, so it\u2019s really a mixed bag in what we are seeing here.","But bottom line, we think we are going to see consumer demand be weak, investing full forecast we agree with that. We don\u2019t see government demand weak. So we see our own growth coming from the business sectors in our view. We were seeing demand there. We were seeing a longer cycle times as well in the business sector. So it\u2019s not totally negative but we are not seeing the growth by any means there that we hope to see maybe in the second half of the year. Karen will add to that.","Karen Puckett","Yeah. I would. Two adds there. In terms of just what the different business, strengths right now in business solution really is around MPLS, Ethernet bandwidth. And so we\u2019ve been very successful in getting large MPLS type of customer. What\u2019s important for these large customers to have diversity of course and as they are looking around at other carrier or letting change their position extremely well and winning or loss goes on in that particular segment, saying that relative to the economy and such. I would say that actually there is a bright spot here because businesses, at least lot of the businesses that spoke until recently are looking for ways to do things differently.","And so they really are a very serious to that, looking at that ousourcing and taking their IT and outsourcing at or even some of the network sources and getting that sourced. I have been in conversations with very different, even that it was six or eight months ago because I believe businesses have to do things differently. And they see this as one opportunity for us. So we are pretty encouraged with that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from [David Fritz] from Citigroup.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. Just following up on the stock repurchasing conversation. Would you consider using your revolver to repurchase stock with normal cash?","Glen Post","David, I mean we\u2019ve really primarily used free cash flow during the first quarter. We don\u2019t have anything drawn on our revolver now. We will consider using the revolver to a certain extent. But again it\u2019s going to be used in for opportunistic purchases. We did commit to the agencies and just from to ourselves from a liquidity standpoint that since we are non-investment grade now at least at the parent company, we are going to keep a $1 billion free on the $2 billion revolver just from the liquidity standpoint.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Fair enough. And then just data point update, did you get any dividends from your subsidiaries Embarq or QCI score?","Glen Post","We did pay dividends. We did pay quarterly dividends from ourselves up to the parent company, yeah from Embarq and QC.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And then finally, when would you expect to release the financials for Embarq this quarter?","Glen Post","Actually, we adjust our website. Yeah. They are password protected and only those to bond investors that own the bonds in Embarq. So they are not really broadly distributed. The QC 10-Q that will be filed prior to the due date, probably on Monday.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Adele from Morningstar.","Michael Adele - Morningstar","Just really quickly on nice step-up in DSO broadband, in the first half last year, just curious if you could give any more color on (inaudible) and any additional details you can provide on what type of speed customers you are taking on that value chain would be helpful too.","Glen Post","Mike, we missed a part of your questions, you got gargled, would you repeat the question please?","Michael Adele - Morningstar","Sure, on the DSO I asked, just in terms of the competitive environment, any changes in there for the past quarter or so and then what type of speeds you see your customers take on average?","Karen Puckett","I got the speed question, I am not sure the first question. On the speed, we are seeing speed probably in the 10, 12 meg category. So we do see customers wanting to take higher speed. And the first question was around the competitive environment, in general it is competitive environment, and continuing to be in competitive environment. And we continue to execute very well and we will continue to be competitive.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stanley Martinez from Legal & General.","Stanley Martinez - Legal & General","Curious, in the bond issuance that you conducted in March, you did that at the senior unsecured and just wondering was that expeditiously in order to access term capital relatively quickly to pay down the revolver or as you proceed to share buyback end you potentially draw on the facility more in Q2 and have to, would you seek to use some of your capacity at the Holdco at the senior secured, rather than senior unsecured, potentially to issue notes which are callable to provide yourself with more optionality and maybe reduce our interest cost further?","Stewart Ewing","Yeah, Stanley, at this point, first of all we did just the $1 billion issuance and we\u2019re really going for $500 million and had so much demand and the rate was so good, we decided to take $1 billion. But we basically used that to repay the credit facility as well as we had a maturity coming up about that time of that company, so we paid debt off as well. ","In terms of using senior secured debt, we\u2019ve not discussed that at this point. I think as long as the unsecured markets are where they are. We will continue to use the unsecured markets in the parent company.","Stanley Martinez - Legal & General","What about in terms of adding some more interest rate optionality to the debt portfolio in terms of callables versus the normal term loans that you do now, might that be an additional way to try to optimize things as you put into the high yield entity?","Stewart Ewing","We will look at it Stanley as it comes along and as we look at each potential issuance that we can get a significantly better rate and get some optionality. At this point we are basically -- first issuance we did was really almost just like we were an investment grade issuer, really was not difference at all in terms of the execution and the demand and the rate for that ---","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael McCormack from Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Could you say a comment regarding cable competition, I know Karen, you said you\u2019re pretty happy with your speeds relative to other competitors. But are you seeing cable getting more aggressive and trying to attack you on speed and then on the small business side what you\u2019re seeing from a cable perspective?","Karen Puckett","Yeah, in terms of what I said, I think the question was around -- we will remain competitive and that\u2019s really around the execution, in terms of speaking of that, that is a challenge clearly. DOCSIS 3 continues to be a challenge, it has been. So it\u2019s not a different challenge, it\u2019s the same challenge but pretty well deployed. In terms of the cable into small business, they have been aggressive, they made margin estimate, they put feet on the street and they continue to progress in that particular area and we will continue to be very focus in the SMB and small business side of house also.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Okay. Karen, just on the high speed side, is there any thoughts internally to be accelerating trying to get fiber deeper, adjust those and be able to continue to rollout, we are seeing a lot more consumption in the home?","Karen Puckett","And I would say that our history shows that I think relative to the type of company, we are -- we have to have different toolboxes, depending on the density and the demographics. So we focus not only density but we try to use our capital in a very targeted away and going where we have the higher demographics to provide the GPON type services, if that continues to work for us.","Omaha definitely is the trial. They had a whole lot of fiber in the particular footprint from the fire video service that was there. And so this gives us a chance in a very economical way to go in and look at, what are the propensity to buy, what are the churn rates, what are the fee take rates, what\u2019s the best kind of market, so really excited about that.","On a greenfield basis, we always try to put fiber in. And then as long as we can kind of continue to push fiber in, when we have the opportunity we will. But again, fiber doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s incredibly important and so we got different technologies depending on the profile of the network and the customers segment we are going after.","Michael McCormack - Nomura","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Phil Cusick from J.P. Morgan.","Phil Cusick - J.P. Morgan","Hey, guys. Thanks. Can you talk a little bit more about the Prism TV efforts? In Phoenix, you said that there was a good start there. Can talk more about the one gig efforts in Omaha and the pending soft launch, should we expect a higher general OpEx, both from the Omaha efforts and the soft launch or is that sort of baked into the guidance at this point and figured you could get through it?","Karen Puckett","It\u2019s definitely baked into the guidance. And we\u2019ve taken a lot of cost out of business, as we continue to bring Prism in. So we\u2019ve done a pretty good job of balancing that. In terms of Phoenix and Prism, we are into soft launch, incredible encouraged by the results, not only from the customers take rate but frankly from the execution of the operational teams. And really it's one of the best soft launches that we have but you get key learnings along the way.","In terms of Omaha, a couple of things. The reason we are there because there was a video product that Qwest had there prior. The franchise agreement was up. We had some decisions to make. We looked at that footprint which is a nice, dense area and it was just left with lots of fiber running right by the home and so that give us a rich opportunity to really try out GPON in a bigger way. And so again, the reasons for that is to really test the technology to take rates in a go to market and take the learning and then make decisions from there.","Glen Post","I might just add to that, Phil. If you look at the rest of the year and you look at the expenses that have been increasing as we mentioned -- Stewart mentioned earlier, lot of expense -- lot of the issues driving expenses or the factors driving expenses is our investments in the new service like Prism, our Data Hosting expansion, our broadband expansion where we have business cases that are going to drive revenues or are tied to revenue, even including our fiber to the tower works.","Lot of our CapEx as well as our OpEx the rest of the year are tied to growth efforts. So we are pleased with our ability to really contain our expenses or focus our expense, our investments as we like to tell them all, all these out there, we expect revenue growth to occur over the next couple of years.","Phil Cusick - J.P. Morgan","And if I may, one more quick one. I apologize if you talked about this in your prepared remarks but you talked about one-time expense reductions your experienced during the first quarter. Can you just detail for this for us a little bit?","Stewart Ewing","Yeah. Phil, we had some probably about $20 million of one-time items that were expense reductions and really some timing items as well in the first quarter that weren\u2019t spent, that will be spent later in the year, such as our branding campaign, that got started a little bit late. And so some of the expenses that we expected in the first quarter get pushed out in the second quarter. So just a few items like that, a few items from the standpoint of either one-time credits that we had in the quarter, expenses related to tax settlements, things like that.","Glen Post","A large access settlement.","Stewart Ewing","Even we had an access settlement as well.","Phil Cusick - J.P. Morgan","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019m showing no further question at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. We are pleased with the solid results which we achieved in the first quarter. Customer diversification and product portfolio expansion in recent years has positioned us well to grow our strategic revenues from our mix of small and large enterprise customers.","We also believe our strategic product portfolio positions us to differentiate our cloud and managed services offerings through the bundling of both network and cloud services, the expansion of our Prism TV service from the recent launch of savvisdirect, our managed hosting cloud services platform for small and medium business customers further strengthens our product portfolio and should provide us additional revenue growth opportunities in 2013 and beyond.","And finally, I\u2019m pleased with the strong progress we made on the share buyback program over the past three months. And we look forward to the opportunities through the remainder of this year presents. Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect. Have a wonderful day."],"4974":["CenturyLink, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results released earlier this afternoon. Sorry for the few minutes' delay, but there was an operator error on our end. I won't call the name, but I think his initials were TD. And now I think we're off and ready to go.","So the slide presentation we'll be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we'll open the call for Q&A.","As you move to slide 2, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for first quarter and full year 2017, the pending sale of our data centers and colocation business, the pending Level 3 transaction, and other outlooks in our business.

Anyone listening to a taped or a webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of today, February 8, 2017 and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","So as we move to slide 5, I'll now turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results and operational initiatives as well as provide guidance for first quarter and full year 2017.","Beginning on slide 6, as we entered 2016, we shared with you our broad view of how we think about our business and operational focus for 2016 and beyond. Our key objective is to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. Whether it's providing connections or services on top of that connection using the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and businesses is really what we are about.","We'll share with you in a minute where we think we made progress toward that goal in 2016, but first I want to touch on our 2016 financial performance. Overall, I am not satisfied with the 2016 results and we are laser-focused on improving our trends going forward. Stewart will discuss with the details a little later, but there are a few things I would highlight about our 2016 results.","For the year, total revenues were below our expectations due to slower growth in our strategic revenues than we anticipated coming into 2016. This underperformance was primarily due to a slowdown in the rate of growth in Business high-bandwidth data services, reflecting lower than expected new sales MPLS and Ethernet services compared with our original expectations. We also saw lower growth in Consumer broadband revenue, driven by unit declines as we shifted our marketing spend more towards bundled higher speed solutions and tightened our credit policy.","Also, we saw slower growth in Consumer video subscribers and revenues than originally anticipated, and that obviously had an impact on our results. And we achieved lower than anticipated managed hosting and IT services revenue, driven principally by our managed hosting results. Taken these together, these results drove us to miss the targets we established at the beginning of the year and to come in at the low-end of our fourth quarter guidance.","There are definitely a number of bright spots in our results, but as I look back at 2016, we didn't deliver at the level we expected. However, during 2016, we saw significant progress toward our goal of connecting people to the power of the digital world. If you move to slide 7, we operationalize that goal by focusing on a narrow list of key objectives.","First, with respect to maximizing market penetration of enabled network and adjacent services. While we didn't hit our broadband unit target for the full year, we did see significantly improving trends in that business as the year progressed. We improved from a broadband subscriber loss of 66,000 in second quarter 2016 to a loss of 40,000 in third quarter 2016 to a small 5,500 loss in fourth quarter.","In fact, Consumer broadband adds were slightly positive for the fourth quarter and showed a 22,000-unit improvement compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. This is a positive trend and we are encouraged that it appears to be carrying over into early 2017.","On the Business side, we grew high-bandwidth revenues by approximately 6% year-over-year. This is not as robust that we think it can be, but it does represent solid demand for our core Ethernet and MPLS product offerings.","At the beginning of this year, we have a significantly higher level of contracted orders in our provisioning funnel. So while our overall 2016 revenue results were not what we expected, we are encouraged by the trends coming out of the year.","Moving to the second initiative, we believe the greatest potential for us to drive returns on our capital investment lies in enabling and delivering broadband services. Obviously, the biggest thing we did in 2016 on this front was the Level 3 acquisition. I'll discuss that later, but we remain very excited about the long-term strategic value of that acquisition.","In addition to the Level 3 deal, we also continued to invest to increase the reach and speeds of our network. During the year, we increased addressable units receiving 100 megabits and 1-gig-plus speeds by 31% and 53% respectively. We also launched our SD-WAN offering and standardized and increased the capabilities of our Ethernet offerings.","Of course, from a capital allocation point of view, the corollary on the Level 3 acquisition is the colocation business sale we announced in fourth quarter 2016. And we recognize the value of colocation and managed service to our Business customers, but we believe we can more efficiently meet that need by aligning our investment focus to the network and partnering with others for the delivery of colo services. I'll update on the colo process later, but this sale aligns with our network-first focus that we're continuing as we move into 2017.","We exited 2016 with a more robust, faster, and more capable network than we entered the year with, and our ongoing investment and the Level 3 acquisition will increase that advantage as we move forward. In addition to creating a network advantage, we are also intent on improving our customer experience. We have a long way to go before we're where we want to be, but we did see important progress during the year.","Our customer experience focus during the year has been on increased product standardization, a higher level of automation, and improved provisioning intervals. Two product standardization examples to highlight that we achieved this past year are an ongoing project to reduce the number of consumer broadband offerings as well as the Ethernet standardization I mentioned earlier that moves us from three Ethernet offerings on multiple platforms to a single offering deploying the latest Ethernet technology across our service footprint. This type of standardization both improves the customer experience and enables, of course, higher margins.","An important example of increased levels of automation and customer self-service is seen in the SD-WAN development, our deployment I mentioned earlier. This capability provides customers virtualized routing, analytics optimization, and security functionality all in one unified software platform.","Finally, during 2016, we were very intent on improving service intervals for our key products. That focus paid off as we have seen a 20% to 30% improvement in service intervals for our key products, such as Fiber+ and local Ethernet. This focus on improving our customer experience is beginning to be seen in our results, as we saw 15 basis points improvement in consumer broadband churn year over year and a 30 basis point improvement in Prism TV churn. We are also beginning to see improvements in our enterprise churn trends with an approximate 30 basis points improvement in 2016 versus 2015. And as we have a ways to go to achieve our fully realized customer service vision, but we are intent on improvement, and we saw significant progress toward that goal in 2016.","Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know that our long-term success will require ongoing realignment of our legacy cost structure. The simplification and automation I mentioned earlier are expected to be an important driver of efficiency over time. But it's not just changes to systems and products, we know we have to take on the hard work of streamlining processes and reducing costs on a wide front.","During 2016, we implemented several cost-containment initiatives, including the reduction of employee-related expenses by 7% to 8%. Also on the capital side, you will notice that we have reduced our expected 2017 capital spend to $2.6 billion. I want to say a word about that.","First, I want to point out that we don't believe this reduction will materially affect our revenue trajectory in 2017 or 2018. We have a significant amount of embedded capacity in our existing network. Our broadband investments for 2017 are expected to actually be a little higher than 2016 levels. On the other hand, with the colocation sale and pivot to partnered and multi-cloud solutions, we expect to spend less in those businesses than we have averaged over the last several years.","Finally, with the Level 3 acquisition expected to close in 2017, we thought it is prudent to dial back our capital expenditures to give us a better opportunity to ensure that we fully understand the synergy opportunities and that we're spending our capital in the most efficient way possible.","Moving on to slide 8, as we look forward to 2017, there are a number of trends I would like to call out that I believe will be important, positive drivers for our business. First, our consumer broadband unit trend is improving from negative 50,000 in the second quarter to slightly positive growth in fourth quarter. And most of these units are at more competitive, stickier, higher ARPU and higher speeds of 40 megabits and higher. We have significant opportunity to further penetrate markets where we have higher speeds and the capacity in consumer broadband capabilities.","We're also continuing to invest to improve the reach and speeds in our consumer broadband network, including investments in CAF-II markets, where we expect significant pent-up demand for higher--speed broadband services in these more rural areas.","On the video side, we are trialing an over-the-top product, but more generally, we're monitoring the rapid evolving video market closely. We don't look to video as a significant revenue and EBITDA contributor in 2017, but certainly it has potential in the months and years ahead.","We're also seeing positive spots in business network services. As I noted earlier, our bandwidth data services grew at about 6% in 2016. That is solid performance that we believe we can improve. We are continuing to see improvements in our business network sales trends. As we enter 2017, we have a contracted provisioning funnel that is about 40% higher than when we entered 2016. These are services that are under contract and they're in queue for provisioning. And certainly, this gives us more confidence going into 2017 in our ability to meet our revenue objectives.","These improving sales trends and increased provisioning queues are bolstered by the improvement in service intervals I noted earlier. We expect these factors to drive a faster book-to-bill ratio and accelerated revenues throughout the year.","We're also continuing to improve our Enterprise broadband offerings since we're investing in both the reach and capacity of our network and continuing to penetrate the enhanced Ethernet and Software-Defined Wide Area Network products I discussed earlier. These next-generation network products have been well received, and we expect them to grow in the months ahead.","In IT and Managed Services, we had launched new and expanded IT solutions and integrated high-growth customer applications and workloads with our network hosting and private cloud infrastructures. These new offers such as managed security services, Managed SAP and HANA, enterprise cloud and managed big data and Big Data-as-a-Service have all been very well received by industry analysts and are beginning to show good traction with our customers.","Finally, we have realigned our customer-facing organization and its three distinct groups: Consumer, Enterprise and IT and Managed Services. We expect this realignment to drive greater focus on the customer experience and accelerate growth by enabling higher levels of operational focus, faster decision making, and market responsiveness as well as accountability. We're optimistic about our future. Our path to growth won't necessarily be linear, but we are confident that we have the assets, the people and the right strategic focus to become one of the world's leading network service providers.","Finally, before Stewart reviews the quarterly results in more detail, I want to provide an update on the two transactions we have currently underway and moving to slide 9. First, as we announced on November 4 of last year, we have agreed to sell our data centers and colocation business to a consortium led by BC Partners and Medina Capital. We received HSR approval and are in the process of obtaining final approval from CFIUS [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States]. And we expect to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of this year.","In regards to the acquisition of Level 3, we're making progress in the approval and integration process. We have completed all state and federal filings, and we expect to complete the necessary international filings within the next few weeks. Additionally, we have formed an Integration Management Office to coordinate and drive the integration planning process on this integration implementation once closing occurs. We believe this combination will create significant benefits and growth opportunities for all our stakeholders including our customers, our employees and our shareholders.","First, this transaction will enable us to build scale and deliver agile network-based products and services to customers, and we really will be creating a new chapter with this combined company. We also believe this combination with Level 3 will significantly improve CenturyLink's growth profile, better position the combined company to improve its revenue trend and grow.","We expect it to drive meaningful operating cash flow growth in the first full year post closing, including synergies as realized and including integration costs. We expect to drive more than 10% growth in free cash flow per share in the first full year post closing, including synergies as realized and, again, including integration cost. And we expect to drive significant improvement in free cash flow per share in subsequent years.","The transaction also enables accelerated recognition of Level 3 net operating losses, which will reduce the combined companies' net cash tax expense, positioning us to create enhanced free cash flow and lowering CenturyLink's dividend payout ratio. We expect to be able to utilize the combined companies' strong product portfolios to bring the market even compelling solutions to the combined companies' customer base. We continue to expect to receive all the necessary approvals in a timely manner and close the acquisition, we believe, by the end of September 2017.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the fourth quarter results and provide an overview of first quarter and full year 2017 guidance we included in our earnings release issued today. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules.","Turning to slide 11, today, CenturyLink reported fourth quarter results with total and core revenues, operating cash flow, and adjusted diluted EPS all within our previously provided guidance ranges. Fourth quarter operating revenue on a consolidated basis was $4.3 billion, a 4.2% decrease from fourth quarter 2015 operating revenues. Growth in Business high-band data services and Consumer Prism TV revenues was more than offset by lower legacy revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.86 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 4.1% from the year-ago period.","Operating income, which includes approximately $200 million of costs related to severance and transaction costs, was $392 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.59 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37%.","Cash expenses for the fourth quarter increased $44 million year-over-year, primarily due to higher Prism TV content cost and group medical insurance cost. Free cash flow defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income was $190 million for the quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.08, a decrease from $0.62 in the year-ago period. Again, the diluted EPS result this quarter includes the after-tax impact of over $200 million of severance related and transaction cost.","Now moving to slide 12 and our Business segment, in fourth quarter, the Business segment generated $2.55 billion in operating revenues, which decreased 4.1% from the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 1.1% compared to fourth quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services and VoIP revenues, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 8.7% from fourth quarter 2015 due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. Our data integration revenues decreased $10 million from fourth quarter a year ago due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total Business segment expenses were flat year-over-year.","Now, turning to slide 13 and the Consumer segment, which generated $1.45 billion in total operating revenues, a decline of 4.3% from fourth quarter 2015; strategic revenues in this segment grew 1.4% year-over-year to $784 million, driven by year-over-year growth in Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 10.4% from fourth quarter a year ago, primarily due to access line declines and lower price increases in 2016. Operating expenses increased $15 million or 2.4% compared to the same period a year ago primarily due to higher Prism TV content cost.","Now, turning to slide 14 and our guidance, our guidance for 2017 assumes that we own the colocation business for the full year. To adjust for the sale of the colocation business, you can remove revenue of $50 million per month and expense of $25 million to $30 million per month from the closing date through the remainder of 2017. The anticipated free cash flow on the sale is estimated to be a reduction of $5 million to $10 million per month. Our guidance also assumes cash income taxes to be between $500 million and $600 million in 2017 and that we make $100 million discretionary contribution to our pension plan.","For first quarter 2017, we expect operating revenues of $4.23 billion to $4.9 billion (sic) [$4.29 billion], core revenues of $3.8 billion to $3.86 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.49 billion and $1.55 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.51 to $0.57. In first quarter, we expect continued growth in strategic revenues to be offset by anticipated declines in legacy revenues, resulting in lower first quarter 2017 core and operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2016.","First quarter 2017 operating cash flow is expected to be lower compared to fourth quarter 2016, primarily due to the anticipated decline in revenues and higher operating expenses primarily related to employee benefit and marketing cost, along with the impact of approximately $40 million of favorable expense adjustments in the fourth quarter 2016.","For full year 2017, we expect operating revenues of $17.05 billion to $17.3 billion, core revenues of $15.25 billion to $15.5 billion, and operating cash flow between $6.15 billion to $6.35 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $2.10 to $2.30 per share. We expect free cash flow of $1.55 billion to $1.75 billion, including capital expenditures of approximately $2.6 billion.","We anticipate lower operating revenues and core revenues in full year 2017 compared to 2016 due to expected legacy revenue declines more than offsetting anticipated increases in strategic revenue growth. Full year 2017 operating cash flow is expected to decline from 2016, primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy voice and low-bandwidth data services revenues. The company also anticipates a decline of approximately $150 million in depreciation and amortization expense for full year 2017 compared to 2016.","In addition, 2017 includes an approximate $70 million increase in pension expense, which of course is a non-cash item. This non-cash item accounts for over two-thirds of the difference between the midpoint of our 2017 operating cash flow guidance and average analyst consensus estimates for 2017 operating cash flow.","Free cash flow for full year 2017 is expected to decline from 2016 due to the lower level of operating cash flow and an increase in cash income taxes for the year, partially offset by lower capital expenditures. We expect our dividend payout ratio to be in the low 70% range for 2017.","While we continue to face pressure related to strategic revenue growth and our legacy revenue declines, as Glen mentioned earlier, we are confident in our business and our ability to improve the revenue and operating cash flow trajectory over time.","Now I'll ask the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please proceed.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions, a couple if I could. The first one would be on the guidance. Stewart, if I multiply the midpoint of your revenue and your EBITDA guidance by four, you get below the low end of the full-year guidance for revenue and operating cash flow, which would imply that you're guiding to revenues U-turning and EBITDA U-turning in the following quarters, which would be a pretty big milestone for CenturyLink looking at the historical trending data. So if you could elaborate a little bit on that, that would be super helpful.","And then the second question would be on the CapEx. I think you said that there was some element of the pending Level 3 merger that was in the lower CapEx number. Obviously, there are some CapEx synergies that are baked into the hypothetical merger model. I'm wondering. Are we pulling those forward into the current guidance, or is the money you're not spending now in addition to the money that you might incrementally not spend with the Level 3 deal?","And then my last one if I could just real quick is when you're thinking that the Level 3 vote will get scheduled. Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","So, David, on the guidance, you're correct. We believe that basically we will be able to improve throughout the year in terms of the revenue from the standpoint \u2013 especially in the latter half of the year. The Consumer business, basically we're working very diligently on penetrating the customers that we built to from the standpoint of increasing the seeds available to them. We're working on reducing our churn rate. So we have mitigation programs in place that, based on the trends we've seen in the last couple quarters, we think we're going to be able to show an improvement from a customer standpoint. Dean, do you want to talk about Enterprise for just a minute?","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. On the Enterprise side, we believe that we'll continue to see a nice ramp up of our revenues associated with the Enterprise business for three reasons. The first reason is that when we look at our backlog, our booked backlog, we see an improvement of 40% improvement in our booked business going forward from the first part of 2016 through the first part of 2017.","The second piece is that we are replacing our Ethernet products. We had four Ethernet products in the marketplace that are now being replaced by a single Ethernet product. It's available at all 35 of our markets. It's MEF 2.0 compliant. So it's a current product, consistent with what we're seeing in the marketplace with our competitors.","And the third piece is that we continue to enjoy some nice performance improvements in our MPLS business combined with our SD-WAN business, which is going through a number of POPs with our customers, and we believe that those POPs will become real revenue generating business opportunities in the second half of 2017.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","And in IT Services and Managed Services, we're seeing \u2013 first of all, we have a sales force in place now that we really didn't have last year. Basically, we were using our selling team that was part of Dean's organization to sell those services, and we basically came to the conclusion that we needed to revamp and stand up a sales team again, which we've done during the latter part of 2016. And we're starting to show some progress there. So we think we can turn around the reduction in IT Services and Managed Services that we've seen over time as a result of that. Glen, you want to address CapEx?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I will. Regarding CapEx, we're not pulling forward synergies from the Level 3 transaction. This is really pausing our work here to be sure we're investing in the right areas. As we said earlier, we've built a lot of capacity and a lot of capability in the network, and we have a lot of range or capacity to sell into now. And we think it's the right thing to be sure we're spending in the right areas and to be sure we're not spending in areas that there's overlap with the Level 3 assets.","So we think it's wise to pause for a minute and the impact for us is \u2013 if you look at what the impact could be we think it's most \u2013 we talked about in our top 25 markets (32:41) over 90% of our households and business having 40 megabits capabilities. That could go down to maybe 86% \u2013 87%. If you look at 100 megabits, we anticipate over 70%. That could probably be at the 67%, 68%. So we're not talking about big impacts and then we would make that up in 2020 if we didn't hit those targets. So it's only a slight miss based on the reduced CapEx.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just quick on the potential timing for the Level 3 vote?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We expect the proxy to be out...","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Within the week.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Within the week.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","And meeting sometime in mid-March.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Meeting in mid-March.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. All right, thanks, guys. Good luck.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come to the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please proceed.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much. Just filling on some of the prior questions, it does seem as though that you folks experienced a material improvement in terms of your broadband subs. How should we think about the progress there and outlook? It does seem as though your expenses were bit higher in the Consumer arena, so just want to understand how to think about the positioning of that business going forward, particularly as its contribution to the overall joint entity will be lighter post the Level 3 deal.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Well, first of all, we're seeing partially the results of the build-out of greater capacity and greater speeds in the network and that's starting to pay off. As I pointed earlier, we're seeing most of those customers in the 40 megabits range for us where we're seeing the real high take rates of our service. That's one of the issues.","We've also made major progress on churn. We see the improvement in churn just working to make sure we can improve the customer experience and that we're making sure we're more competitive in the marketplace in certain areas. So, long term, we think that we can drive cash flow in this business and we'll see continued improvement in the units.","I would say that we'll look more deeply into Consumer; how we approach Consumer going forward. It'll be a low percentage of our business after we complete the acquisition of Level 3, but it's still really a strong business where I believe with the network advantage that we have, we continue to have good success in competing in that Consumer marketplace.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","And expenses were a bit higher in the Consumer business, and this is principally driven by the increase in the subscribers that we have to our Prism TV service. So it's a content cost associated with that. I can tell you that, basically, we will work to try to mitigate expenses in the Consumer area from the standpoint of the approach to the market from a broadband perspective.","I think we're going to be more efficient with respect to marketing to our broadband customers. We're simplifying our offerings, which will make it \u2013 we believe make them easier to sell, make them stickier with our customers and also allow us to market them at a lower cost from an expense standpoint, lower marketing cost than we're incurring today.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And just one follow-up, if I may. If we look at your earnings outlook for next year, should we assume that you folks have fully baked in that 7% to 8% employee cost reduction that you had highlighted?","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. Yes, it's fully baked into the guidance that we given.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. It's been a few months now since you announced the Level 3 deal. Can you give us an update on synergy expectations? As well, can you help us understand the level of cash taxes you expect to pay with Level 3 under the current tax regime? Certainly not in zero, but can you give us a range? Do you expect it to be a quarter, half or more of the gap level? And then, finally, how are we thinking about leadership of the combined company operations? Are Dean and Maxine going to be in charge of their respective combined businesses or is this just for this year before the deal closes? Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, Phil, regarding the synergy expectations, those are still \u2013 we have not changed those expectations. However, I think we're comfortable than we were even before as we got deeper into the potential of bringing these companies together that we can and will achieve those announced synergies. We have $850 million of operating synergies, plus $125 million of CapEx synergies, and we believe those are very achievable at this point and we are confident in those.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","And in terms of the utilization of NOL and the impact on cash taxes, if nothing changes from an income tax standpoint, regulation standpoint, we would expect to use the NOL that Level 3 brings over about the first five years or so after we close, so about a $2 billion utilization of NOL, so you could just take the statutory tax rate times that. So, let's say this is about $700 a year or so in cash taxes.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And then on the management structure, we have not announced anything there yet. We expect to do that probably by early March as far as the Tier 1, those executive reporting directly to me. So we're working through that as we speak and will hopefully \u2013 again, I hope to announce that by early March.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. So, Dean, you mentioned the backlog number being up 40%. Perhaps you can just elaborate a little bit more on that. You talked about some of the product developments. Is there anything going on in the broader economy or in the broader competitive environment? Now we've seen some better confidence numbers, any color you could provide us about what's going on in the marketplace would be great.","And then I think, Glen, you talked about reviewing over-the-top and trialing some of that and thinking about how that impacts Prism. Perhaps you could just expand a little bit more about what we should expect from Prism and over-the-top in 2017. Thanks.","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","All right. So as we \u2013 if we look at the marketplace and some of the trends in the marketplace, as I mentioned, we got a new Ethernet product that we brought to the marketplace and is available in all 35 markets. It's a single product that combines four prior products, so we simplified our portfolio. It makes it easier to provision and we believe that the speed of provisioning and, therefore, the speed of revenue is going to be greater going forward in the Ethernet product.","In MPLS, we are enjoying some success in MPLS. In the fourth quarter, we believe that we actually grew market share on an MPLS standpoint. Market grew about 4.3%. We grew roughly 4.9%. So a difference in our growth versus where we are in the marketplace and that obviously provides us with some confidence going forward.","The SD-WAN product has started to enjoy some market acceptance in terms of POCs and trials that are going on in the marketplace and we'll see that really grow in terms of interest in the product as well as in actual conversions to a SDN platform. We've moved many of our facilities to be able to be virtualized and take advantage of the SD-WAN product, about 50% of the network to-date, and we continue to drive towards that so that the entire network is capable of working through that SD-WAN platform.","So, in terms of products, technology that we are seeing and our own ability to manage our business, our backlog, our provisioning and the like better in the latter part of 2016 I think bodes very well for where we're going in 2017.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, customer behavior is pretty stable, industry growth is stable?","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. We've got the challenges that most of our competitors have in terms of pricing and the like, but we are seeing a churn level that's actually reduced year-on-year, and so we think that not only is the customer acceptance solid, but we are seeing that manifest itself in new product acquisition as well as in our churn numbers.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Simon, I'll start on OTT and Maxine may want to add to this. But if you look at our Prism product, as you know, we've talked about content costs have really gone out of sight the last couple of years. If you look at the margins, sometimes actually negative margins. But we certainly \u2013 we have to make a truck roll and the cost of provisioning really makes it difficult from a returns standpoint for really driving the kind of returns we expect.","With over-the-top product, we don't have to make a truck roll. We have much wider availability due to lower bandwidth requirements of over-the-top. We have network-based storage for DVR. We'll have local channels to help distinguish that product. And our trial is getting really strong reviews right now. But we have really deemphasized the Prism product because of the margin issue. Now the value there is the pull-through. We get a strong pull-through, 90% pull-through of additional services, and 50% of those customers are new customers to CenturyLink. So that's the real value here of the Prism product. But we have deemphasized that and moving more toward the over-the-top product and also focusing more on the broadband offerings we have versus the video. Maxine, do you have anything? That's all we need to say.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Are we going to see the rollout by the middle of the year, or what's the expectation?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We'll start rolling out by midyear \u2013 around midyear the over-the-top.","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","We're in trial right now in four markets. We plan to launch those markets in early second quarter, expand that midyear, and then further expand it throughout the year.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions, just two, if I could, one on Business high-bandwidth revenues. If we just think about the trends up until now, I know there's an expectation revenue growth reaccelerates. But maybe if you can talk to the slowing growth to date, is that more company-specific, or is there a competitive element you're seeing more as well?","And then secondly, maybe a question for Glen on the regulatory front. How do potential changes in the regulatory environment like corporate tax reform or less regulation at the SEC level change how you think about CapEx priorities? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. Dean, do you want to take the first one?","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","So first of all, with regard to Business high-bandwidth growth, a couple things that you need to be mindful of. As I said, we introduced a new Ethernet product. And so obviously, we have a product in the marketplace that clearly needed to be replaced, and so we invested to do that.","But I think that the other piece that we really need to focus in on is in the middle part of the year we changed the focus of our business so that we were focused on our customers and routes to market, specific routes to market. And so that management team was put in place in the middle part of the year, and we started to see the benefits of that new organizational structure towards the latter part of the fourth quarter as we looked at our business going forward. And so that's why 2017 is different than 2016. The way we're going to market as well as the products we're taking to market are different.","And then the intervals that I mentioned earlier because of the way in which we provision our products now and the simplified product portfolio shorten the amount of time from sale to revenue.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Matthew, regarding the (46:02) given all the noise around tax reform, I believe that we're going to see the President and the administration and the Congress initiate. I think tax laws are going to be good for businesses in general. I think we're going to see it drive economic development, incentive for investment. I don't think it impacts our priorities really. Our priority is really to invest in our network to drive additional speeds, opportunity to bring new products and service to our customers, expand our offering to additional \u2013 scope to additional areas of the country, really improve our fiber connectivity and the related services. So those will continue.","I just want to point out, one investment we made this year that we'll start begin seeing real benefit of going forward as far as our network investment, we have virtualized about 60% of our major IP POPs as of the end of 2016. And we plan to have 100% of those virtualized by the end of 2019. We also have almost 50% of our network capabilities currently controlled through our SDN network, so virtualization of those capabilities. We have virtualized WAN service availability, virtualized interconnect between VPN customers, just a number of virtualization steps we've taken. Again, 50% of those capabilities are virtualized today.","Once we complete those, we expect to save over $200 million a year in CapEx. By about 2019, we expect those to complete, and we expect significant savings there. And also, we expect major OpEx cost savings as a result of this virtualization of the SDN, NFV network builds. So those are the type of investments we'll continue to make, making our network more efficient.","Also just the incremental revenue opportunity of virtualization, we think it can have significant impact on the revenue opportunity for a couple reasons. First of all, it becomes more customer-friendly. The customers can control their own destiny to a certain degree, how they distribute their bandwidth, for instance. And it enables us to cover a lot more businesses. When you virtualize, you go outside your current territories to many more businesses than you otherwise could reach. Today, just what we've done thus far with the 60% virtualization, we're reaching 4.8 million businesses. A large amount of those were business we could not previously sell to. So that's the type of advancements we're seeing. We think it can really help reduce our cost as well as provide revenue opportunities.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Sorry, if I could just go back to Dean's comment, I just want to be clear. So the deceleration to date, it seems like a lot of these were company-specific product set execution. But was there any change in the broader market spending environment or just competitive landscape in recent quarters to be aware of?","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","We've tried to address the competitive posture by the routes to market that I disclosed \u2013 that I talked about just a moment ago. The routes to market really do allow us to have a more segmented approach to the way in which we're going to market and reaching our customers, and we believe that that provides us a differentiated go-to-market approach. And, obviously, we're seeing that manifest itself in some areas. For example, as I mentioned, we grew market share in the fourth quarter in the MPLS market space.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Can you talk to us a little bit more specifically about the expectations for the CAF spend in 2017? And then, can you give us a little color on sort of your overlap with the Level 3 network and what your expectations might be for any sort of any potential divestitures or other resale obligations you might need to incur as a remedy for the deal? Is that something you're expecting?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, Frank, on the CAF 2, Stewart can answer more specifically. The reduction in our CapEx will not affect the CAF 2 spend. We're not going to reduce that spend with the reduction in our planned CapEx for 2017.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, Frank, at the end of the year, we had a little less than 30% of the build-out done in terms of the homes that we've obligated ourselves to pass with the 10 meg down, 1 meg up. By the end of 2017, we expect to be about in the 40% range. So it's on schedule with what we had anticipated. And, frankly, that should help us with our broadband adds in 2017 as well.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And, Frank, we do think there could be some required divestitures of certain properties in certain markets where we have just Level 3 and CenturyLink the only ways into the building, so we could do some of that, but we don't know that we'll see that or not. But there could be some divestitures. We have not heard any feedback on this yet.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Hey, Frank, what we're able to do with the other deals that we've done in the past, with the Qwest transaction for instance, we were able to agree where we had the only entrances to a building to basically provide CLECs and others an entrance for a flat fee basically for a period of time. So we weren't required to divest there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please proceed.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. A follow-up on the over-the-top question. As you develop plans and trial this product, do you think that you'll just keep it developed internally or would you consider a third-party solution like AT&T's DIRECTV NOW? Maybe can you provide some color around how much CapEx you spent on Prism TV in 2016 that seems to be coming off the budget?","And a final question on the fiber assets that you have. A lot of discussions right now that as the carriers plan for 5G, they need more fiber. How do you think the company with Level 3 is positioned and what are some plans to capture that demand?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","First of all, Batya, on the over-the-top, we're looking at every option. If we can get a better deal or we can get some of our content cost down and get the same type of service available with a DIRECTV NOW, we'll certainly take a look at that. We are talking to all of our service providers, looking at every possibility there.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","And CapEx for Prism, Batya, in 2016 that would be coming off, basically we have two head-ends and they're built and in place. And there's no \u2013 really minimal CapEx to maintain those. Most of the CapEx that we're incurring now related to Prism is success-based from the standpoint of set-top boxes that we have to purchase when we add a customer, but really the investment is more for broadband than it is from a Prism TV standpoint. So the amount that would be coming out would be minimal.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And regarding the 5G, the need for bandwidth there, we're talking with the potential carriers of the \u2013 or providers of the 5G capability, and certainly there are opportunities there. We have not quantified it yet. We really don't know what that would be, but we're certainly working with those carriers to consider the opportunities there, especially where we have fiber access and transport capabilities.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks. Sir?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Brian. I am pleased with the progress we've made in 2016, but there's certainly more to be done. We have dedicated and passionate and capable employees around the world who approach their responsibilities each day with a customer-centric mindset and with a sense of urgency. They are a great asset, a great advantage for us. We have a strong set of assets and the financial strength to continue to invest in our future, and we have the strategic clarity of how we will grow our business by connecting our customers to the digital world.","So we're excited and inspired by the opportunities we see for our customers, for our employees and our shareholders. We plan to continue to leverage and position our assets to drive future revenue growth, EBITDA growth, and shareholder value.

Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2013 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","On Slide 2, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for fourth quarter 2013 and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us and our forward-looking statements.","We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Glen?","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. First, I would like to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of our employees in the Northern Colorado region. During the worst of the flooding that occurred during September we got thousands of customers experienced service outages among, of course, other hardships.","Our local field operations team worked around the clock and managed unprecedented workloads for several weeks and we brought resources from around the states and country into the Front Range areas to support our local teams and they did, they all did an amazing job restoring service to our customers there. So (inaudible) including our employees who have been partially impacted by that event.","Turning to slide five, we are pleased with our financial results for the third quarter. We continue to make good progress on number of fronts. We believe our investments and our key strategic growth initiatives continue to strengthen our overall product portfolio which further position CenturyLink as a leading integrated provider of global network, data hosting and cloud solutions.","I want to address a couple of significant special items that affected our financial results for the quarter. First, as you saw in the release, we booked $1.1 billion non-cash goodwill impairment in the quarter.","The impairment was related to goodwill assigned to the data hosting segment and it was primarily due to our recent performance impacted into the development of growth projections used for calculating impairment.","We are not satisfied with our recent results in this segment of our business and we will be taking aggressive step to drive the revenue growth and margin. Margins in this segment to be more in line with industry growth rates are going forward.","Certainly, we have reached tentative agreement on the principal financial term, a potential settlement of the KPNQwest bankruptcy litigation in the Netherlands. The oral agreement was reached following confidential mediation between CenturyLink, KPN and KPNQwest trustees.","As a result, we have recorded \u20ac172 million or $233 million based on September 30, 2013 exchange rates, pre-tax charge this quarter. This proposed settlement amount of \u20ac172 million is a significantly below the $4.2 billion euro litigation claim. We are hopeful this settlement will finalized and look forward to putting this issue behind us.","Beginning on slide six, I\u2019d like to review some highlights from the third quarter. We generated solid financial with annual strategic revenue growth of 4.2%, excluding low speed private line data services, our strategic revenue grew by 12% for the quarter. Strengthen revenues from high-speed internet, high bandwidth, data products, data hosting and Prism TV were the primary drivers of this growth. We generated strong subscriber growth in the quarter, adding 33,000 broadband customers and 17,000 Prism TV customers.","From our business market perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers for network and hosting services during the quarter. And also in the quarter we made strong progress on the share repurchase program we announced in February, through November 5th this year we repurchased 38 million shares or 6.1% of our outstanding common stock totaled approximately $1.3 billion.","We have repurchased shares aggressively since the start of the program and we expect to opportunistically buyback additional shares going forward. Due to combination of dividend and share repurchases we return over $2.2 billion to shareholders through the first three quarters of the year, that\u2019s a 63% increase compared to approximately $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2012.","Let\u2019s turn to slide seven, I\u2019ll provide an update on our key strategic initiatives, starting with broadband expansion and enhancements. We continue to make significant investments in this area that we believe will better serve our customers and our business and our consumer customers.","We ended the quarter with approximately 5.94 million broadband customers. As I said earlier, we added 33,000 new subscribers in the quarter, which was a strong improvement from the seasonally weak second quarter.","We believe our fiber assets, including nearly 240,000 fiber route-miles across the U.S. have positioned us well in the business market. We continue to grow our advanced multi-tenant unit MTU program. We added 400 fiber-fed buildings in third quarter, increasing the number of fiber-fed buildings by 40%.","This program offers broadband capabilities of up to 500 megabit of symmetrical service and enhances cloud connectivity for these business customers. In addition, we plan to leverage our existing fiber to opportunistically expand speed and service capabilities to high value business and consumer customers.","We are focusing on GPON technology in certain high district -- business districts offering broadband speeds of up to 1 gigabit. Both the MTU and GPON programs offer upstream speeds and business service level agreements for SLAs beyond what is normally available at cable companies. These offerings are particularly compelling in the business market where upstream capabilities are critical to the enablement of cloud services. And business areas where we do not offer our advanced MTU or GPON program, we would essentially deploy Ethernet services. We currently cover over 2 million business locations with Ethernet capability with nearly half of this footprint capable of 20 megabits and higher symmetrical speeds.","In Omaha, which is our first GPON 1-gigabit market, we had deployed 1-gig service capability to over 40,000 homes and we expect to reach nearly 50,000 homes in the trial area during the fourth quarter. We are very encouraged of these early results in Omaha and we announced in October that we'll expand our fiber network to Las Vegas enabling Internet speed to up to 1 gig to small businesses and select neighborhoods in that market.","In the months ahead we expect to continue making investments in our network to enhance speed capabilities required to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets. Turning now to slide 8. Our Prism TV service continues to perform well and represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV service in the markets where we offer this service. We added a record 17,000 Prism TV subscribers in the third quarter ending with a total of 149,000 subscribers in service. Over 50% of these added customers are new to CenturyLink and they continue to have a high rate of broadband attachment. Now this quarter we expect a record level of 98% attachment rate.","We continue to expand the footprint where Prism service is available. And in the third quarter, we added approximately 285,000 addressable homes of which just over half are newest markets of Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Omaha. We are very pleased with the early Prism subscriber growth and our first legacy Qwest market to provide this video service in Colorado Springs and Omaha. Prism bundle customers are significantly less likely to churn than single-play voice customers.","In the third quarter, the churn rate for Prism triple-play customers was over 600 basis points lower than single-play voice customers. Additionally, we continue to enhance our IPTV features by introducing new functionality and applications including expansion of our TV Everywhere capabilities, video-on-demand library and a recent successful trial of wireless set-top boxes.","Continuing on now to slide 9. A third key strategic initiative is investing in fiber builds to as many towers in our services areas as economically feasible. During the second quarter we completed approximately 1,200 fiber-to-the-tower builds for a total of over 17,900 across our footprint. We currently expect to complete a total of 3,500 to 4,000 builds in 2013. That is slightly below our previous expectation of 4,000 to 5,000 primarily due to construction delays by wireless carriers.","As expected, we continue to experience some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper-based DS1 facilities to fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we anticipate that wireless data bandwidth growth will result in the expansion of Ethernet consumption and thereby reverse the current revenue compression during 2014.","Moving on to slide 10, managed hosting and cloud services. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in this space where we have developed and are expanding our strong product offerings. We experience weaker than expected sequential data hosting revenues primarily due to one-time credits and Legacy Qwest Hosting churn in the third quarter. Despite weaker third quarter revenue, we continue to expect revenue growth in the second half of 2013 compared to the first half of 2013. ","We continue to build up on solid momentum of the past two quarters with solid new sales again this quarter. Cross-sell or team selling opportunities for hosting products across our hosting and networks sales teams continues to be strong with sales of hosting services to business customers steadily growing. We expect this momentum to continue, these customers continue indicating strong demand for managed hosting cloud solutions, streamline their operations, and increase efficiency and reduce cost.","As we work through the exiting of a few major colocation customers from the Legacy Qwest data centers, fully enable to selling of hosting products to our large base of business network subscribers and expand our own boarding process. We expect to see significantly better growth in our hosting operations.","We continue to invest and increase -- to increase our data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. We currently have 55 data centers globally.","In the third quarter, we had approximately 20,000 square feet of sellable floor space through the expansion of existing facilities in three markets. And year-to-date we\u2019ve added approximately 80,000 sellable square feet.","Lastly, we recently expanded our partnership with VMware allowing Savvis and VMware to offer enterprise services on VMware's hybrid cloud powered by Savvis colocation services and we\u2019re pleased with that partnership development.","Finally, before I turn the call over to Stewart, I\u2019m pleased that the tentative agreement with CWA and IBEW was ratified in later October. The contract covers 12,000 employees and will be effective through October 7, 2017.","Our focus in these negotiations has been to align the cost structure and work rules under disagreement with the rest of organization and the competitive dynamics in the markets where we operate. But we\u2019ve made progress towards these objectives.","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the solid results for the third quarter. We continue to invest to drive growth and are experiencing good traction in these key areas.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results.","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I will spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the fourth quarter guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Turning to slide 12, on a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss of $1.05 billion and a loss per share of $0.76, primarily driven by the two special items, Glen mentioned earlier that were disclosed in our press release.","With the remainder of my comments, I'll be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. As you can see, we generated solid operating revenues and cash flows in the quarter.","Operating revenues were $4.52 billion on a consolidated basis or 1.2% decline from third quarter 2012 operating revenues. Our core revenues defined as strategic revenues plus legacy revenues were $4.1 billion for third quarter, a decline of 1% from the year-ago period.","Our strategic revenues grew 4.2% year-over-year and now represent 49% of our total revenues. Strength in the strategic products such as high-speed Internet and high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and managed hosting services continues to drive this growth.","Third quarter 2013 cash expenses increased 1.4% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by higher professional fees and non-employee costs which offset lower personnel related cost. Included in third quarter expense was less than $5 million related to the Colorado floods, Glen mentioned earlier.","We've also incurred less than $10 million of flood-related expense during the month of October. We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.81 billion for the third quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40%.","As we move toward revenue stability, we do expect continued pressure on operating cash flow as the revenue mix shift to lower margin products, we near the full achievement of operating expense synergies related to the Qwest acquisition. And lastly, we continue to make investments in strategic areas to drive future growth.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for third quarter was $0.63. As we discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.","Additionally, we generated $761 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income. Our strong cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to slide 13, the 1.2% decline in third quarter 2013 operating revenues compared to third quarter, a year ago was primarily the result of growth in strategic revenues that was more than offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use.","The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed internet, high-bandwidth business data services, Prism TV and data hosting services. ","Now turning to Slide 14. I will discuss each of our operating segments, beginning first with the consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 2.1% over third quarter a year ago. Our strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.8% year-over-year to $644 million, driven by growth in high-speed internet and Prism\u2019s customers and price increases. ","The long term growth rate of high-speed internet is likely to slow over time due to our growth in penetration of household. Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 8% from third quarter 2012, due primarily to a continuing decline in access line and long-distance revenues, partially mitigated by an increase in the excess recovery charge. Expenses in this segment declined $5 million or approximately 1% during the third quarter, compared to the same period a year ago, driven primarily by lower employee related costs, which were offset by higher Prism TV costs. ","Moving to Slide 15. Our business segment generated $1.54 billion in operating revenues during the third quarter, which were flat with the same period a year ago. On a sequential basis, total revenues grew 1.2% from second-quarter 2013. Our third quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased by 6.3% to $640 million from third quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services, MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength.","Excluding low-bandwidth services, strategic revenue grew nearly 9% from a year ago. We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer segments and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and midsized business customer space to improve our market share and drive further growth.","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 3.8% from third quarter 2012 due primarily to continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues, partially mitigated by an increase in the excess recovery charge. Our total segment expenses increased $22 million or 2.4%, driven by higher facility costs, partially offset by lower employee related and CPE expenses. ","Now turning to Slide 16, our wholesale segment generated $878 million in operating revenues, a decline of 3.5% from third quarter 2012. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $563 million, down 1.1% from third quarter 2012, as decline in low-speed transport services revenue offset growth in Ethernet services and data bandwidth capacity expansion by wireless carriers. ","Our legacy revenues in this segment declined 7.6% to $315 million, reflecting the continued decline in access and long distance minutes of use and the implementation of lower access rates under the CAF order rate step-down. Our operating expenses for the quarter were $293 million, 3.6% below the same period from the year ago, driven primarily by lower personnel related facility costs.","Moving to Slide 17 and our data hosing segment, which includes all colocation, managed hosting, cloud services and hosted related network services revenues. This segment generated $342 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 4.6% from third quarter 2012 revenues of $327 million. ","Third quarter 2013 revenues include approximately $14 million of revenue contribution from the Ciber IT outsourcing assets we acquired in October 2012. Data hosing year-over-year revenue growth was weakened by the impact of large client bankruptcy related churn and price erosion in previous quarters. ","Data hosting operating expenses were $274 million in the third quarter compared to $246 million in third quarter a year ago. This 11% increase is driven primarily by higher employee costs related to the Ciber and Appfog acquisitions that were not present in the prior period. Despite recent weakness, we expect long-term improvement in both revenue and margin trends across the data hosting segment and continue to leverage its assets to drive additional revenue through cross-selling opportunities in our other sectors.","Turning to Slide 18, we provide our fourth quarter 2013 guidance. For the fourth quarter of this year, we expect total operating revenues of $4.5 million to $4.55 million. Our core revenues of $4.07 billion to $4.12 billion and operating cash flow between $1.75 billion and $1.8 billion.","Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.55 to $0.60. Our fourth quarter expenses are expected to increase from third quarter 2013, primarily due to higher data integration costs related to increased CPE sales.","That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I will ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David Barden - Bank of America","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question, if you could go into what you might imagine lots more detail about what's going on in the data center business? I think two things. One is on the write-down. Clearly there's some amount of growth rate in the future that you don't think you are going to achieve that you thought you are going to achieve. So if you can address what the difference in that growth rate is? ","And then second, on the kind of quarter-to-quarter performance, it looks like the managed hosting business went down $5 million. If you could talk about some of these credits and other things that occurred and I think, Glen, you mentioned that the data hosting business should grow half over half but it could still go down next quarter and grow half over half? So if you guys could give us little bit more sense as to what the expectation here because last quarter we were still expecting this business to grow single digit, so seems like something kind of really went off the rails in the quarter?","On the other side of the coin, Stewart, the midpoint of the revenue guidance is actually the highest revenue that you guys would've had pretty much for the whole year. And you guys have been talking down revenue growth expectations I think in terms of 2014. But it feels like we are finding some kind of level, so if you could talk about even with the data center business not performing, it does feel like we are flattening out on the revenue curve and could you kind of revisit what the puts and takes are for getting to revenue growth in reaching 2014? Thanks.","Glen Post","Hey, Dave, this is Glen. And I will see if I could guess it kind of on a couple of items. But -- I will get to your question about that quarter -- in the fourth quarter, we do expect growth. It won\u2019t be negative is our expectation. Anyway, we expect to see growth in the fourth quarter, sequential growth in the 2.5%, 3% range is our target for the fourth quarter. But the -- if you look at this past quarter, we have a number of one-time items. Firstly, we had a currency issue of little under $2 million. We had about a $2 million. We had couple of prior year adjustments in there around $3 million. The big item really was the churn of the old Qwest center where we had some very large customers who were peer colo customers, some very large that we know the names but I won\u2019t call it. But who took their business to their internal data centers. They had very large, both had huge amount of data out there. So that\u2019s the bigger, they worked in any cloud and managed services for almost peer colos.","So that\u2019s where a lot of the churn that came from, plus we had a bankruptcy of Kodak impacted us for about $3 million. So it was a combination of things in the quarter. We do expect to turn that growth around. I\u2019m confident that that we can drive growth. In the hosting business, we are seeing significant success in our cost selling efforts. We changed our go-to market with our network customers, are seeing really strong demand. Our sales, as we\u2019ve talked about continued strong and into the fourth quarter. For the last three quarters, it will get strong.","Bookings -- data hosting assets are really important for our future growth. They support analyst of course, industry analyst regarding trends, trends toward RTL outsourcing. We believe those are real. We\u2019ve some work to do. We are making some changes in some of our go-to market work and are focused on certain verticals. And so strategically these are very important assets for us and we see this is where the marketplace is going over time and I\u2019m confident we can grow this business. I will let Jeff make a few comments on this year.","Jeff Von Deylen","Sure. David, Jeff Von Deylen. As we went during the quarter, kind of expected Q3 would be flat to Q2. In Q2, there was some non-recurring revenue. But anyway, we got surprised by the $5 million. I think Glen talked about that. From a new sales perspective, we were in line with new sales really \u2013 we had the same level of new sales in Q3 as we did in Q2. And as Glen mentioned, probably the biggest success we're having is selling into some of the CenturyLink network customers who do hosting today so they're not part of that Legacy Qwest hosting base but they're buying the new products.","So we really think the combination of some of these one-time items are getting behind us after the third quarter. It's why we think the 2.5% to 3% total hosting growth is reasonable. And that's the result of the sales. I will say the quarter's impact has also negatively impacted our network, our other network as we call it, or the wide area. The VPN network was negative year-over-year. If you sort of take that out and just focus on the hosting revenue kind of year-over-year without the credits, we're about 8.6% growth. So a little better than kind of that reported 4% but \u2013 and we feel like going forward some of these one-time credits are out of the way and we're poised to grow sequentially. ","On the question on the goodwill write-down and sort of how we think about that. Stewart, do you want to take that one on the future growth rate?","Stewart Ewing ","","So in terms of the goodwill, David, we \u2013 just basically of our past performance, we decided we needed to take down the, just from an accounting standpoint, take down the assumed growth rates that we're using going forward for purposes of calculating the value of the business and comparing that with the amount that just flows and just decided that we needed to go ahead and write it down. I mean we certainly believe, as Glen pointed out in the value of this business going forward, we believe that we can get the growth rates that will \u2013 and if you look at market comps basically, there's more value there than we wrote it down to really.","So we're comfortable with that. I think we're conservative in the write-down and we're conservative in the projections that we used to calculate that. Your question concerning the revenue guidance and it feels like we're getting \u2013 finding some level of flattening revenue curve. So basically yes, we are continuing to get towards and move towards flat revenue. It's a little slower than we thought it would be a few quarters ago. And that's why we said last quarter we didn't think we'd get a flat revenue in '14.","But basically it's dependent on the continued growth and strategic revenue. The data hosting business is a big part of that. IPTV revenue and success there that we're seeing is a big part of that. And continued success in our business sector, with the MPLS revenue that we're driving there and the new customer growth we're driving there, we're having some really good success there. And if we can bring the success that we're seeing in the large customer segment, large enterprise customer segment down to the small and mid-sized segments will help us to get there quicker.","The other place is basically just our high speed Internet. We need to continue to do well from the standpoint of adding customers and hopefully increasing rates a little bit over time as we were able to do in the third quarter.","","David Barden - Bank of America","Okay. And just a follow-up quick, when you're looking for the data 2% to 3% growth, is that year-over-year or sequential?","Unidentified Participant","Sequential.","David Barden - Bank of America","Okay. Thanks a lot.","","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks very much. Could you dig a little bit more into the broadband numbers? You have very nice snap back. Obviously some of that was seasonality. But did you change or go to market with that driven by promotions. Is this also a level that we think is sustainable over the next couple of quarters? And capital intensity continues to move up into the mid to high teens. As the fiber-to-the-tower build slows, when do you think we'll sort of see a peak in that capital intensity, or are we seeing it right now or we are going to maintain it for another year or so? Thanks.","Karen Puckett","Hi. This is Karen Puckett. In terms of the broadband bounce back, we are pleased about that obviously. I would say no new go-to-market. We continue to execute and we do this well and so the seasonality helped. Also we were able to overcome the indirect partner we spoke about last time with some digital partners that we had helping them increase their business and our call center channel performed very well, as well as it\u2019s getting very focused on our go-to-market in terms of our prospect leads and making sure that those are all optimized. So the things that we normally do we continue to do well and have a good quarter from that.","Stewart Ewing","Yeah. Simon, regarding the capital budged. We expect CapEx -- even though we do expect on the top of the tower spend to go down. We believe we will -- our budget will stay in the range in the $3 billion range that we are talking about. It can be a little plus or minus either side of that, but that\u2019s the range we expect it to be and because video uptick we think we have a broadband expansion driving additional revenue opportunities.","Also one of its success based, yeah, third of our, about a third of our budget will be success based capital. So we continue to be successful in even at NPLS working and the Savvis sales, data center expansion and a lot of that will be success based. So we expect to be in this range, in this $3 billion range we expect for 2014.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS","Great. Thanks. First a follow up question on the data hosting business. I think couple of months ago you had mentioned that we will see some pick up in churn in the first quarter of \u201914, would the churn that we saw in the quarter, was that pulled forward or do you expect another pick up in churns in the beginning of the year?","And the second question is on the business revenues, we saw some slight improvements year-over-year growth in that business? Do you expect that to continue? Thanks.","Jeff Von Deylen","It\u2019s Jeff. Regarding to churn, the $2 million that we referenced on legacy Qwest that was a surprise, so that was sort of over and above what we had forecasted, so and we don\u2019t have kind of current view of Q1 -- Q4, Q1 any more large churn, any higher than kind of where we currently run, so that $2 million that we reference, we are going to reference in this quarter was over and above what we expected. But then as we go forward to Q4, Q1 we sort of expect to have sort of that a normal level of up churn which we currently run in the 1.3% to 1.5% of revenue.","Stewart Ewing","And Batya, on the business revenue growth, I mean, we do hope to continue to improve our business revenue growth, somewhere in the third quarter related to some price increases that we did, but small amount of it. But we are again seeing good success on the large multi-node NPLs networks and strategic data revenue growth that we are seeing in our business sector.","Batya Levi - UBS","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Goldman from Goldman Sachs.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess I want to follow up on David\u2019s question earlier and just looking at the 4Q guide that you\u2019ve laid out for really from both revenue and for EBITDA, if you kind of look where you came in 3Q, fairly close to the mid-point of your guide there, but which is though you are bringing down full year guide by about 50 million or so at the mid-point for both revenue and EBITDA, if we take your 4Q numbers there.","So I am wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the puts and takes that we should be thinking about, I know, you highlighted CPE? But anything else we should be thinking about, Stewart, as we go forward on that?","And then, secondly, obviously seeing good results on Prism IPTV and market expansion and the quality churn implications in HFI tax rates as you get there? Just wondering how you think about the opportunity to maybe accelerate that either within adjusting CapEx budget or even a willingness to move CapEx little bit higher just given the benefits of that product?","Stewart Ewing","Yeah. So, Scott, in terms of fourth quarter guidance, I mean, considering the guidance that we have for full year and the performance in the third quarter and our guidance that we gave in fourth quarter, we will probably be somewhere around the midpoint to the lower end of the guidance that we gave for revenue and operating cash flow for the full year. So yes, to the midpoint or slightly below. We feel good about that. There are some \u2013 we do expect an increase in our CPE sales in the fourth quarter and the associated costs with that since that\u2019s a low margin product.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","In terms of Prism \u2013","Glen Post","Yes, just to talk about Prism, we build out in markets where we are, we sell and other phases going in Phoenix and Colorado Springs, as well as Omaha, and other areas, we are building it, and you build out in those markets. As we continue to see success, as the growth continues we will consider expanding to other markets, that will be part of our 2014 budget processes. We are in a process of going through now and we will be considering those expansion, as far as increasing the budget \u2013 we don\u2019t expect significant increases in the budget, capital budget to build out Prism release in 2014. But that is an opportunity for us as we look \u2013 we continue to see success here, it\u2019s an opportunity to really consider acceleration to build-out in the months and years ahead.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Just one follow up to the guidance. Anything we should be thinking about in terms of the new union contract, how that layers in, in 4Q and into 2014 that would impact \u2013 benefit you on the EBITDA side come 4Q?","Glen Post","Yes, not much impact in the fourth quarter. We should see some margin [ph] little bit in the first quarter and full year 2014.","Operator","And our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thanks guys. Two questions. Where do you think your pricing is on the datacenter side versus market and versus legacy, are you seeing kind of much over-build in the markets that you are in, or is it more just the internet companies connecting their own facilities? And then secondly, on the GPON strategy, could you maybe just give a little bit more detail on how it compares and contracts to what kind of Verizon and FIOS and maybe a little bit of color on the cost structure and it seems like a very large opportunity and I know Omaha you had lost a lot of market share historically, maybe if you can give some color on what kind of update you are getting out there?","Glen Post","Sure. First of all, on the data center side, specifically it relates to colocation, I think our lighter fee base, certainly any pricing over the last few years has probably declined in 15% range. So some of those clients that are coming up for renewal, and just pure colocation we have to \u2013 we see that in price erosion. You are right that the larger, bigger content, kind of guys that build around data centers and look at choices of where to put their environment and we\u2019ve had that certainly in our numbers, negatively impacted. I will say there are probably couple markets that we think may be more competitive or price competitive than one in terms of DC, Santa Clara and Dallas, but those are markets that we are \u2013 it\u2019s good news that we are pretty well distributed and where we are adding footprint is probably away from those markets, where we see some of the wholesalers and other demand going. ","So yes, the last point is, we\u2019re really trying to take advantage of the better base of customers who \u2013 Karen really has a [indiscernible] and our abilities to data center and even colocation, racks and bubbles to those customers that they have never had that offer before when you take that \u2013 it really helps us kind of de-emphasize some of the larger one megawatt and above kind of deal, to really have enterprise, smaller opportunities. ","Karen Puckett","And Tim, Karen, on the GPON question, yes, I would say in terms of just Omaha, if you think about that, we had fiber deployed in that core of the network. So it made sense to put GPON in, what we are cutting to do here is really understand the market with the GPON message, take rate and such as well as hardening our process, somewhat of a new process for our systems and our organization. I will tell you that we are very pleased, we have not pitched even hard on the soft launch Omaha, very pleased with the result both from a consumer and business standpoint. So encouraged in every operating metric. The biggest, we have some fiber to the curb technology. So we have the fiber and we decided to use the most recent GPON capability to enable that again to try, to further harden our process and the legacy ceasefire in terms of those systems and processes.","Our focus is very targeted in terms of going after the high addressable market and consumer, so they\u2019re premium kind of customers but very focused on the business side too and you will hear more of that in the coming quarters as our focus on GPON with business.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins - Citi","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what\u2019s going on in the cost base and especially relative to revenue. So it seems like the segments that ruined in the quarter when -- let me phrase it year-over-year they grew like the business segment, data hosting segment. That\u2019s where you actually saw segment income decline year-over-year. And in aggregate, if you just look at the -- just the segment income or even take it to the larger consolidated EBITDA level, it looks like EBITDA was down and more than a dollar year-over-year for every dollar of revenue losses.","Stewart, if you can talk to us about how to think about the change in revenue relative to change in the EBITDA whether it can actually get better over time if there any specific issues that were impacting this quarter, more so than usual? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, Mike. So what you are saying is a combination of really two major things that are going on. One, we are cycling through or have pretty much cycled through the synergies related to Qwest. So we are not seeing the offsets to expense increases that we have been having really all along related to how network services really and charges related to business customer grow. And some of that was offset in the past related to synergies that we were achieving from Qwest.","Also, secondly in the third quarter, we do have some seasonality from a cost standpoint. So we got a chance to do maintenance on our networks and things like that. So that really drives our cost down, some in our power cost to higher in the third quarter simply because of the heat and the cooling required, and things like that.","The other is that basically we have new initiatives where we are rolling out new products and their cost associated with that really, that aren\u2019t really -- there's not a lot of revenue benefit there in the early stages in rolling out new products.","So I think that you are seeing some of that too. We should -- we would expect for other than the Qwest synergies for the other expenses to be more in line with the revenue growth in the future though.","Michael Rollins - Citi","","Thanks.","","Operator","Thank you. And I\u2019m showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. Please turn to Slide 21 as we close today\u2019s call. Overall, we are well pleased with our results for the third quarter. We believe our continued investments in key strategic opportunities will help us drive revenue growth and strong financial results over time. We are seeing strong demand from business customers for our advanced network and hosting IT solutions. And we are seeing -- also seeing improved sales success to increase collaboration among our business and data hosting sales leaders around the joint development of targeted innovative solutions.","Our new bundled offers have positioned us to capture additional spend in the IT services space from our customers portfolios. For example, our managed office product is a simple, fully managed bundle solution. It\u2019s created specifically for our small and commercial businesses and integrated all elements on our communications network, managed data, hosted managed voice and managed applications.","We believe these types of products and bundles that we are developing can be very effective in driving, future revenue streams and make -- develop a lot of customers loyalty. Overall we believe we are well positioned to effectively compete and drive revenue growth from our strategic products and services in the months and years ahead. Thank you for joining our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"5081":["CenturyLink, Inc.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, November 6, 2019.","It is now my pleasure to turn our conference over to Valerie Finberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Valerie Finberg","Thank you, Jen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink third quarter 2019 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Neel Dev, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to call your attention to our safe harbor statement on Slide 2 of our 3Q 2019 presentation, which notes that this conference call may include forward-looking statements subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures. Those reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release or our supplemental schedules. Additionally, please note that certain metrics discussed on the call today exclude transformation costs and other special items as noted in our earnings materials.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Storey","Thanks, Valerie, and thank you to everyone for joining us. On today\u2019s call, I\u2019ll give you an update on the state of the business. Neel will provide an overview of the quarter\u2019s financial results, and then we\u2019ll go into your questions.","During the quarter, we continued executing on our strategy around four key areas: investing in growth through product and network expansions; delivering an enhanced customer experience across our business; transforming the operations of our company to improve efficiency and employee experience; and delevering to further strengthen our balance sheet.","Our expanding adjusted EBITDA margin and year-over-year revenue growth in IGAM, Enterprise and consumer broadband demonstrate these efforts are making a difference. Our focus on providing innovative networking solutions continues to resonate with our large business customers for both IGAM and Enterprise. In addition to the year-over-year revenue growth, we followed strong sales in the second quarter with higher sales this quarter.","Included within the Enterprise segment results is our federal sector. We're seeing early wins under the federal EIS contract. We believe we are well positioned to grow our federal relationship under this new contract vehicle.","We're seeing mixed results in our SMB segment. The biggest challenge is offsetting pressures from legacy services such as TDM voice. But by tailoring product capabilities, specifically for this customer segment, products like Unified Communications as a Service, network security, and SD-WAN, we're bringing much-needed solutions to the market for SMB customers.","We believe we operate one of the world's most extensive and capable fiber networks for business and wholesale customers. We continue to focus investments on improving that advantage by expanding our network reach to new buildings.","During the quarter, we added approximately 4,900 new fiber-fed buildings, bringing the year-to-date total to roughly 14,500. These investments are particularly relevant to the SMB customers located in those buildings. Our sales team is focused on leveraging these investments both within and beyond our legacy LEC footprint. Utilizing the entire CenturyLink fiber footprint, our team is intent on becoming a major provider to SMB customers throughout the U.S. I'm excited about the opportunities for SMB and expect improved performance in the future.","Our Wholesale results met our expectations. While revenue can be lumpy in any given quarter, the market is large and CenturyLink is a key player. We do, however, continue to expect this segment to decline over time, offset to some extent by our expanding on-net footprint and Ethernet capabilities. We're obviously focused on leveraging the power of our fiber network to drive growth in all of our business segments.","I'd also like to highlight some of the ways we are enhancing the products and the capabilities we deliver across our platform. We continue to enable our Dynamic Connections product, which provides our customers real-time and self-serve access to secure multi-cloud connectivity across thousands of global endpoints.","Last month, we announced that we added Google Cloud to our ecosystem. Shortly after that announcement, we had customers logging in to our Dynamic Connections platform to connect workloads to the Google Cloud without having to call us or establish new physical connections.","On our second quarter earnings call, we announced plans for our edge computing solutions, which combines our edge computing infrastructure with our incredible fiber network, Dynamic Connections offerings, cloud application management tools, and managed services portfolio. We've already begun closing sales of this newly enabled offering with recently closed a deal to support a global edge computing solution for an IT-intensive securities trading customer.","Our edge computing capabilities enable the customer to move trading system workloads closer to the digital interactions with other trading platforms all over the world. Our solution provides the customer fully managed compute, storage, network, managed security, and market connectivity, monitor 24\/7 by a managed services team aligned to financial services industry best practices.","We're enriching our CDN platform, both organically by expanding our capabilities, capacity, and footprint and inorganically through the acquisition of technology companies like the Streamroot acquisition we announced in September. I won't go too far into the details. The Streamroot gives us disruptive technology that enables connected devices to deliver content through secure and privately meshed networks.","We continue to expand our overbuild of the nationwide ultra-low loss fiber infrastructure discussed on the second quarter call. By leveraging our significant conduit infrastructure, we are deploying this next-generation fiber network at what we believe are significantly lower cost and a much faster time to market.","Investments in these capabilities are leading customers to select CenturyLink to support their complex networking and technology needs. As an example, I'll briefly discuss our relationship with Chick-fil-A. Before I get into the details, I have to say that personally I'm an avid fan of Chick-fil-A. It certainly starts with liking the food, but I also appreciate the way they've integrated technology into providing a superior customer experience.","To even further enhance that customer experience, Chick-fil-A required increased bandwidth capabilities at their restaurants, which we supported with fiber investments to hundreds of locations nationwide. Fiber connectivity is a foundational component of the Chick-fil-A digital strategy and is enabling many of their smart restaurant initiatives. We continue to work with this customer to support their future digital requirements.","Turning to our Consumer segment, over the past couple of years, we've made strides in our efforts to transform our Consumer business. We have simplified our go-to-market approach, focusing on an easy-to-understand, non-promotional offering known as Price for Life. This simplified product has significantly improved the customer and employee experience, reduced marketing and customer care costs, lowered churn and driven higher ARPU. Coupled with our transformation initiatives, we focused on driving higher levels of digital interaction and customer self-service. You heard me say a number of times, we will grow where we invest, and we continue to invest in deploying consumer fiber where it is economical to do so.","In 2018, we shifted to a consumer investment strategy that was heavily weighted to fiber-to-the-home solutions rather than investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We\u2019re seeing good success with this strategy. Micro-targeting our fiber builds down to the neighborhood level and digitally targeting sales efforts down to the individual households.","As I said, these efforts are paying off. Through our Price for Life offer, higher levels of fiber deployment and improved customer experience initiatives, we've seen year-over-year growth in consumer broadband revenue each and every quarter since the beginning of last year. We're very focused on accelerating that growth and while we certainly have more to do, I'm pleased with our ability to operate the Consumer business to grow where we invest and to generate significant free cash flow.","I'd like to touch briefly on our ongoing strategic review of the Consumer business. We continue to make good progress with the review. However, as I've previously said, these are complex assets and this is an extensive process. We believe there are good opportunities in the Consumer business, and we are dedicated to identifying the best path forward for our shareholders. We remain open to the various potential outcomes, but we won't give specific details until we complete the review and decide upon a definitive course of action.","Moving back to our overall strategy. The entire thesis of our business is that we will build and leverage our extensive fiber network to deliver the capabilities our customers require for their own digital transformations. As we look at our company going forward we have several strong beliefs that form the basis of our strategy.","First of all, the reliance of enterprises on networking solutions is growing not diminishing. Customers need our products and services for artificial intelligence and big data, augmented reality, multi-cloud environments and the exponential growth of IoT devices, complex networking services are the key enablers for these applications.","Of course, we have to keep pace with technology advancements and adapt our products, adapt our services and the delivery mechanisms to match. But that's the true opportunity for us to execute well in the market and we are intensely focused on it.","Secondly, whether compared to copper, hybrid fiber-coax, wireless or even 5G, we believe fiber is the long-term technology winner. We all spend a lot of time talking about wireless and it certainly has its place in the last few hundred feet. But there is no scalable communications technology where fiber is not the true underlying infrastructure. Wi-Fi, private LTE, 4G all go back to fiber as quickly as possible. In fact, the key enabling technology for 5G will be the continual densification of our own fiber infrastructure.","Third, for Wholesale and Enterprise customers, direct fiber-based services are a clear favor to wireless or copper solutions. The scalability, the reliability and affordability of fiber is unmatched by wireless, free space optics, microwave, HFC or any other transport technology you can name. We will continue to invest in being the preferred provider of direct fiber-based solutions.","Lastly, investments in our digital transformation and expanding our fiber reach, our investments in long-life assets that generate sustainable free cash flow into the future and are key to our growth and improving profitable revenue.","From a transformation perspective, we believe simplification and automation will drive a better employee experience, a better customer experience, lower churn, improved sales and increased margins. We've made steady progress toward transforming our company during 2019 and have a milestone-based set of initiatives over the next few years to drive those outcomes.","In summary, we continue to invest in the growth of our business through product enhancement and network expansion. We remain focused on providing a superior customer experience by transforming the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating capabilities and we are committed to meeting our deleveraging objectives, while driving long-term sustainable free cash flow per share.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results for the quarter. Neel?","Neel Dev","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary on slide four. For the third quarter of 2019, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.261 billion. Year-over-year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40.3% from 29.3% from the year ago quarter. From a cost transformation perspective, we achieved approximately $360 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings which compares to $290 million reported in the second quarter.","We are pleased with the improved revenue performance this quarter, specifically for IGAM and Enterprise. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are reiterating all full year 2019 financial outlook measures. While revenue declined, year-to-date adjusted EBITDA grew compared to the same period in 2018.","This growth was driven by improved revenue trajectory in our Enterprise business, our continued focus on profitable revenue. Management of legacy product declines, along with the benefits from our cost transformation initiatives.","Turning to revenue on slide five. Total revenue in the third quarter declined 3.6% to $5.606 billion. This compares to declines of 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. Before moving to revenue by segment, I want to point out that we saw a substantial increase in USF or Universal Service Fund rates this quarter.","Relative to the first couple of quarters this year, USF revenue is up approximately $40 million this quarter. Keep in mind; this is pass-through revenue we collect for the FCC. Sequentially, excluding the step-up in USF that I just mentioned, total revenue decreased 0.2% compared to the 1.2% sequential decline we saw in the second quarter and a 2.3% decline in the first quarter.","Within our IGAM segment, revenue grew 0.8% year-over-year. We saw currency pressures, both year-over-year and sequentially. On a constant currency basis, revenue grew 1.9% year-over-year compared to 1.6% growth in the second quarter. Sequentially, revenue was roughly flat. As a reminder, last quarter benefited from strength in non-recurring revenue of approximately $15 million.","Moving to our Enterprise segment. Revenue grew 3% both year-over-year and sequentially. Adjusting for the step-up in the USF, revenue grew 1.5% year-over-year and sequentially. This compares to a decline of 1.2% both year-over-year and sequentially in the second quarter of 2019.","Revenue growth was driven by installs from sales earlier in the year as well as strength in the federal government channel. Overall, we're pleased with the progress towards our objective of growing both IGAM and Enterprise revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019.","SMB revenue decreased 6.4% year-over-year compared to a decline of 10% in the second quarter of 2019. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.3% compared to a decline of 2.5% last quarter. We continue to invest in our product capabilities and continue to feel good about our ability to sell into our on-net building footprint with a large addressable market opportunity.","Wholesale revenue decreased 6.6% year-over-year. Sequentially, we saw an increase of 0.7% compared to a decline of 1.8% last quarter. I'd like to point out that specific to the third quarter of 2019, we did see a benefit from a carrier settlement of approximately $15 million.","Turning to Consumer on Slide 6. Third quarter 2019 revenue declined 9.2% year-over-year. In the third quarter of 2018 revenue was stronger due to a benefit of roughly $40 million from a revenue recognition-related adjustment completed during that quarter.","As a reminder, we adopted the new revenue recognition standard in 2018. Excluding the benefit of that adjustment in third quarter 2018, revenue would have declined 6.7% year-over-year. This compares to an 8% decline last quarter. Sequentially, revenue declined 1.3%, which compares to declines of 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter.","Broadband revenue for the third quarter 2019 grew 2.3% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 1.8% last quarter. Broadband performance last year was largely driven by our Price for Life initiative. This quarter and going forward, our performance will be a function of our fiber-to-the-home investments and improving the penetration of our competitive assets.","In the third quarter, we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 54 000 subs. I'd like to point out that for the third quarter of 2019 versus the third quarter of 2018, we have roughly doubled our greater than 100 meg sub additions. We also saw similar year-over-year growth in the first and second quarter of this year.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 7. For the third quarter 2019 adjusted EBITDA was $2.261 billion compared to $2.287 billion in the third quarter 2018. As you think about EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis, keep in mind, the revenue recognition adjustment that I just mentioned benefited third quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA. On a sequential basis, we saw the typical increase in utility costs in our network facilities. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.3% for the third quarter 2019, compared to 39.3% in the year ago quarter and 35.5% at the close of the Level 3 transaction.","As of the end of the third quarter, we've achieved approximately $360 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the third quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $38 million and free cash flow by $32 million.","Moving to slide eight. For the third quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $957 million. We continue to invest in expanding our fiber footprint, adding buildings to our network and the initiatives that Jeff mentioned earlier. In the third quarter 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $983 million.","Turning to slide nine. We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.7 times which compares to 4.3 times at the close of the Level 3 transaction. During the quarter, we retired approximately $700 million of debt and through the third quarter we have addressed roughly $1.5 billion through a combination of actions.","After quarter end, in October, we paid out maturity to approximately $150 million in debt. Including this fourth quarter transaction, we paid down approximately $1.7 billion in debt obligations this year. In addition, we completed a transaction to refinance $1 billion of debt, which lowers interest costs and extends maturities. ","As we indicated at the time, these proceeds will be used in the fourth quarter for redemptions. We paid down $ 400 million of debt in October and will pay down $600 million in early December. Overall, we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75 to 3.25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target.","Turning to the business outlook on slide 10. We continue to feel good with our progress this year and are reiterating all of our full year 2019 financial outlook measures. In summary, we continue to remain focused on execution, specifically on improving revenue trajectory, maximizing profitability and staying disciplined on cost transformation and deleveraging.","Jeff Storey","Thank you, Neel. Operator, would you explain the process for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan","Thanks a lot, guys. Can you discuss the booking trends on how they've kind of continued in the third quarter and maybe so far this quarter? ","Jeff Storey","I didn't hear the first part.","Neel Dev","Booking trends. ","Jeff Storey","Booking trends. Go ahead. ","Neel Dev","So I think, Tim, for both IGAM and Enterprise, we had strong sales or bookings in the second quarter, and sequentially it was up in third quarter relative to what we saw in second quarter for both IGAM and Enterprise.","Timothy Horan","And any more color on what's driving the strength in bookings?","Jeff Storey","I think it's our products and services and the way we deliver on them, and we have confidence in the market and the types of things that we sell our customers need, the types of products and services we have, they're going to need in the future. And I think it's just best doing a good job in the market and expect to continue. I hope to continue.","Timothy Horan","Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Good afternoon. Jeff, you talked about the customer experience and trying to improve the efficiency of the network. Can you just give us a little bit more anecdotal of what you're seeing on the ground and how that's transforming itself into the bookings that Tim was asking about? And maybe Neel just following up, again the visibility you have into moving past the 360 and continuing to move towards the full program opportunity in over the next few quarters? Thanks.","Jeff Storey","Sure. On the customer experience, I mean there's some thing that are just basic blocking and tackling, doing a good job in service delivery, doing it -- having a reliable network and doing a great job in service assurance. Those are things that we focus on every single day.","Part of it has to do with evolving our products. If you look at Dynamic Connections and you think about a customer experience where they can all of a sudden reroute traffic from one cloud location to another, and it can be their own private data center to another private data center, but when they can reroute capacity, scale capacity up and down, move it around, however they like, without having to pick up a phone, without having to call through us, without having to wait for service delivery, that's a much better customer experience.","And so, we're making enhancements in our products and services. We're making enhancements continuing to move things on-net. More you're on-net, the better reliability, the better experience our customers have. So, we're continuing to focus on a whole array of initiatives to drive the customer experience there.","Simon Flannery","And are you -- like Net Promoter Scores, is there any -- are you seeing any kind of metrics or things that is going to help you kind of get more tangible about how your -- how the customers are really feeling?","Jeff Storey","Sure. And especially, if you look at our Consumer business in the -- our fiber product, our Net Promoter Scores have, have improved dramatically and are pretty good. We're pretty pleased with the Net Promoter Scores there. And so, yes, we look at a lot of internal metrics to know that what we're doing is actually affecting our customers and the performance that they're receiving is improving their experience overall.","Neel Dev","Simon, on your question on visibility. I think if we look at IGAM and Enterprise, our 90-day funnel is very healthy. And more importantly, the conversations that we're having with the customers are very, very positive in terms of what they're trying to do with their business. The two examples that Jeff gave in his prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing a lot of those were the conversations have been with the CIOs in terms of how they are trying to transform their business. So, it\u2019s a very different discussion where we can bring to bear our whole assets and capabilities, and we\u2019re leaning in there and we are adding fiber into customers' locations to enable a lot of that transformation.","Simon Flannery","Great. And on the EIS, that's good to see. I mean, is that something that will be -- you'll see much in 2020? Or is that -- it's going to take a while to get that through?","Jeff Storey","And I don't want to predict specific timing on contracts, but we're seeing early success already. We were the first company to be certified or whatever the word was to receive bids through that contract and we're seeing that early success.","It's a long-term contract, extends for years and years. And I expect that the traffic will be moving and services will be moving to that contract over a long period of time.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thank you.","Jeff Storey","But, of course, if we\u2019re seeing results already, I expect results in 2020 as well. ","Simon Flannery","Yeah. Thank you.","Jeff Storey","Sure.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Louthan","Great. Thank you. Looking out to the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund auction, how are you thinking about the change there from the current CAF II funding that you're getting, and what's sort of the point where you might walk away from some of that? Auction 903 came in well below the cost model and spread, likely this one probably would come in as well.","Is there a point where maybe you would walk away from that? And then, with that, where are you on the thoughts on the asset sales for Consumer? Are you closer to the end of that process and what completions did come to you? Thanks.","Jeff Storey","Sure. So I'll answer about CAF II and the Digital Opportunity Fund, make sure I'm clear, I'll answer them separately. We have no intention of walking away from CAF II. We're doing a great job. We've got -- we're very far along the way of building that out. And so, there's nothing I'm about to say changes any of that.","With respect to the Digital Opportunity Fund, when would we walk away from it? When it's not advantageous our company. If it doesn't make sense for us to do, we won't do it. And that's not a big problem for us.","We only are going to do things that make sense. So we will be involved in the process. We will make sure that we fully evaluate what it means for CenturyLink. And if we can do something economically that benefits our shareholders, we'll do it. And if we don't, we'll walk away.","Neel Dev","Yeah. Just to add to that, I think, for all the things keep in mind is, that there's an opportunity cost for us to participate. So we -- if you think about the -- our consumer management team and our planning teams, et cetera, if we're going to participate, we want to make sure it's economical, it's a long-term asset that we can drive good penetration on.","And so, that's what we'll evaluate versus just participating for the -- the subsidy is good, but there's also an offset on the capital side. So we're going to look at the overall economics.","Jeff Storey","Frank, I think you had a second -- ","Neel Dev","Consumer asset sales.","Jeff Storey","Consumer assets. Are we closer to the end of that process? Yes. But we're not there yet and we really won't talk about the details of it. What we are focused on in the Consumer business, is making sure we run the best Consumer business possible, making sure that where we invest we grow and we're introducing products and services and the customer experience that resonate with our customers and we're doing that. And then we'll evaluate that and all of the other strategic options and we are evaluating that and all the other strategic options that are out there. And I expect we're closer, obviously, to the end of it. ","Frank Louthan","Okay. Any other asset sales that you might consider real estate or other things that you're not getting a lot of credit for on the balance sheet that could help delevering?","Jeff Storey","Yes. We look at everything. We try to be diligent and disciplined about all of our assets and look at things periodically to make sure and I think there are some things that we're not getting the full appreciation for the value of these assets. And so, if there's something that we can divest, if there's something that we can acquire, where we think we can drive better free cash flow per share for our customers or excuse me, for our shareholders then we'll do that. And we're pretty open and agnostic about \u2013 there's nothing that's off the table. It's not quite \u2013 but I think you get the point.","Frank Louthan","Great. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess to follow up on that. Specifically, there's been reports out there Jeff that, essentially it has been shopping the Latin American fiber assets. And it seems somewhat counterintuitive to me, if that is in fact going on just because you've become focused on developing these enterprise services and assets on a global basis.","If you could kind of comment on whether that's a real thing or not it would be helpful. And then I guess just second on the \u2013 this is the impressive pivot in some of the kind of fundamental IGAM and Enterprise business lift. And I guess the question I have is just in terms of the kind of the composition of that lift. Is it \u2013 are we talking about kind of hundreds of smaller contracts that kind of are just going through the machine and getting installed and kind of run rating? Or are these kind of chunkier, big contracts like the federal contracts that are kind of driving the business at the moment? Thanks.","Jeff Storey","Sure. I'll try and answer the question on LatAm and all of our asset sales -- potential assets sales more eloquently than I did on Frank's question. Look we value our LatAm business. We value our EMEA business. We value the North America business. We think we have great strengths and great capabilities.","We don't comment on speculation and rumors that are out there but we do look at all aspects of our company. And while I won't specifically comment on LatAm or any other thing specific other than the consumer process that we've announced, we are focused on creating long-term value for our shareholders and we'll look into the various opportunities within the context of that.","Neel Dev","On your second question David, I think for Enterprise, it really is installs from second quarter sales. So I think we mentioned second quarter was a good sales quarter. Also for federal, keep in mind we have the federal shutdown in fourth quarter and impacted in January and February of this year, but we had strong federal sales in March of this year. And so a lot of installs on the Fed side as well. So performance on the Fed channel and overall installs related to sells in the Enterprise business.","For IGAM, it's just strength from our large customers. Again, second quarter sales was good from those customers. And we also -- our international business performed well as well. So those are the drivers. ","David Barden","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Mike McCormack with Guggenheim Partners. Please go\u2026","Mike McCormack","Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just two quick ones. Neel, on the equipment revenue for the quarter, I think what should be thinking about there? And then also, I guess, looking into Q4 as well? And then, secondly, a lot of the peers are concerned about pricing in the business marketplace around Enterprise. What are you guys seeing out there as far as spot pricing goes? Thanks.","Neel Dev","So, I'll take the pricing one first and then Jeff may want to add to that. I think, we're seeing pricing dynamic as very rational and we're not really seeing anything that would concern us. Now, on the transactional side, like if you think about long-haul waves, there are certain pockets.","If it's competitive, then we step away at price points that we don't like. But generally, most of what we see are solutions that we're having discussions with customers where price is part of the discussion, but it's not starting with price. They're more focused on the overall solution, specific to some of the examples that Jeff shared. A lot of those are solutions that we're deploying for the customers that our products and services wrapped with professional services and other capabilities.","Jeff Storey","I think that's right. I mean, prices is an important point for customers, but we think pricing in the market is rational and we think that we can win at the prices that are out there.","Neel Dev","And from an equipment perspective, I think, we've deemphasized, like we've said before, low-margin equipment sales, but we do have equipment every quarter, which is more wrapped around solutions that we're deploying. And the margins there are relatively healthy and there's network attached to that. And we see that every quarter, then there's nothing out of the ordinary there.","In terms of fourth quarter, the only thing I would highlight is, keep in mind that fourth quarter of last year was fairly strong. We had roughly $40 million of non-recurring revenues that we highlighted. But as we say here today, we don't see anything like that in the fourth quarter of this year.","Mike McCormack","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. You had prior guidance that you expect Enterprise and IGAM revenues to be up sequentially in the fourth quarter. Do you still expect that? Is there another USF contribution that we need to think about? And also, on the expense side, can you quantify maybe the seasonal expenses that you saw in the quarter? Going forward, can we expect cost-cutting to continue at the pace of the top line decline?","Neel Dev","So for IGAM and Enterprise, I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have seen improvement excluding USF and we expect the same going into fourth quarter. So, overall, we do expect IGAM and Enterprise to do better in the second half of this year relative to the first half of this year. The only thing to keep in mind is, currency has been a headwind.","In terms of your question on seasonality -- cost seasonality. We did see the typical increase in utilities in the third quarter, roughly $20 million. And in terms of the cost savings over the long term, we still feel good about the $800 million to $1 billion. And we have good line of sight there and our execution has been good. So we feel good about that.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Neel Dev","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Del Deo","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. You had a pretty substantial sequential decline in SG&A this quarter. I know there's some noise in that number based on integration costs when they're booked. Is there anything worth calling out behind that decline? And should we think of that as a good jumping off point for Q4 and beyond?","Neel Dev","Yes. No there's nothing specific to call out. Now these things are never linear, so we're very milestone-based. And so nothing specific to call out. There might be some noise like you mentioned with the integration costs. So there might have been some integration costs last year in that -- last quarter I mean in that category. But nothing specific to call out.","Nicholas Del Deo","Okay. That's helpful. And you guys have talked about an opportunity to drive SMB revenue by targeting on-net buildings. Can you help us understand how you're sizing that opportunity and when we might start to see an impact?","Jeff Storey","Well, we don't really talk about how we size it but we look at the various buildings that are out there. We look at the customers in them and we target our network expansions with multiple factors in mind.","We look at off-net expense. If we have off-net expense, we know how much we get to save by moving that building on-net. And so it's a guaranteed returns for us. We look at existing customers and then we look \u2013 and we transition those customers into our on-net footprint and we can provide better service to them.","And then we look at potential customers and we have a pretty sophisticated targeting capability to look digitally at these customers to understand where they are, how we're going to serve them and really position our products for them. And so we'll continue to do that inside the legacy ILEC footprint but we have a lot of opportunity outside the legacy ILEC footprint as well.","Neel Dev","And opportunity outside the ILEC footprint that Jeff just mentioned, the addressable opportunity is large. It really is about improving our execution and that's where we're spending a lot of time in terms of fine-tuning how we go-to-market and how do we drive better penetration there. So that's just a function of execution. We're not constrained by the market opportunity there.","Nicholas Del Deo","Okay. Great. And maybe one quick one for Neel. The $40 million sequential increase in USF how is that split between consumer and business?","Neel Dev","Consumer is very small. It's mostly business.","Nicholas Del Deo","Mostly business. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Reed Kern","Hi. This is Reed for Philip. Two follow-ups if I can. First you talked about equipment. How far through the exit from unprofitable revenue is CenturyLink today? And what's the composition of that remaining revenue? Is it all video? And second I think it goes to Frank and Dave's question, can you expand on CenturyLink's strategy for moving closer to the edge and how that strategy influences your thinking about potentially monetizing non-core assets on the map?","Neel Dev","So on the unprofitable revenue I think the best way to think about it is going forward it's fairly clean. Is there a little things around the edges yes primarily Prism. So we still have call it that $30 million of Prism revenues that will continue to straight way going forward. But as you think about sequential performance relatively clean.","Jeff Storey","With respect to going closer to the edge, fiber is the edge. That's how we pick up customers, how we bring them into the network. So the fiber is the edge of the network. But we -- when we talk about edge computing, that means taking customers' computing resources and moving them closer to that fiber connected edge to the -- closer to the place that that traffic is originated or that traffic needs to be terminated.","CDN is the same way. We continue to move CDN resources that we have closer and closer to our customer, making them closer to the edge where we directly connect to the customers with the fiber infrastructure that we have. I hope that answers the question.","Reed Kern","Thank you.","Jeff Storey","Okay. Operator, I think, that's the last question we have. So I'd like to wrap up, before we conclude the call, to summarize a few key points. As we said and as demonstrated in our third quarter results, we expect revenue performance will be better for IGAM and Enterprise, comparing the second half of 2019 to the first half.","We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on expanding our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network. We are executing on our transformation initiatives, which improve the customer experience and increase efficiency throughout the organization.","We delivered another quarter of solid progress on our deleveraging objectives and expect to be within our leverage target in our three-year time frame. And all of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned to our overall guiding principle, which is to grow free cash flow per share.","Thank you for joining today's call and for your continued support of CenturyLink. Operator that concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you, Jeff. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using CenturyLink conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call. We ask that you please disconnect your lines and have a great day, everyone."],"4966":["CenturyLink Inc.

Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","","Thank you, Saeed and good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2014 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks, portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for fourth quarter 2014 and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in these forward-looking statements. ","We ask that you also note that, our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call, certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our web site at ir.centurylink.com.","Now as you move to slide 3, your host for today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer and also available during the question-and-answer portion of today's call will be Karen Puckett, CenturyLink's Chief Operating Officer; Bill Cheek, President of Wholesale; and Jeff Von Deylen, President of Technology Solutions.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through November 13, 2014 and the web cast replay of our call would be available through November 27, 2014. Anyone listening to a taped or web cast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of November 5, 2014 and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","As we move to slide 4, I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post, III","","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our solid financial performance for the third quarter. We continued to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments that we believe will drive increased revenue.","Now turning to slide 5, we achieved solid revenue in the third quarter. Total operating revenues of $4.514 billion were basically flat compared to third quarter of 2013. This revenue performance represented significant improvement from 1.2% decline in year-over-year revenues in third quarter 2013, and 1.3% decline in pro forma growth year-over-year revenues in the third quarter 2012.","Data integration revenues were $22 million higher in third quarter of 2014 than the third quarter of 2013, primarily due to increased CPE or customer premise equipment sales. Our core revenue, which represents strategic and legacy revenues combined, was $4.08 billion for the quarter, a decline of only 0.6% from the year-ago period. This comparison also represents a strong improvement from the 1% and 1.8% declines in year-over-year core revenues in third quarter of 2013 and 2012 respectively.","Now continuing to slide 6, I'd like to highlight the key drivers for this continued strong improvement on our revenue trend. The improvement in core revenues was driven by the combination of the continued growth in strategic revenue and a lower rate of decline of legacy revenue. Business at core revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year, driven by demand for high bandwidth data services and our bundled service offerings, combining network, CPE, software applications, and managed services.","We also continued to see good growth in Ethernet services from our fiber-to-the-tower investments in our wholesale business as we meet the growing data transport needs of our wireless carriers. However, as we mentioned last quarter, wholesale operating revenue continues to be pressured by the migration from low speed data services to fiber-based Ethernet as well as continued network grooming by wireless carriers. Consumer strategic revenue grew over 6% year-over-year, fueled by continued strength in high speed Internet and Prism TV customer growth, price increases, and improved churn.","Managed-hosting and cloud revenue grew 14% year-over-year, while total occasion revenue grew 4.5%, resulting in total hosting revenue growth of 5.6%, compared to third quarter 2013. Additionally, if you look at our combined business and hosting segment revenues, we've achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the last nine quarters.","Turning to slide 7, we continued to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting, and IP services that we are refining our focus and executing on several strategic priorities. We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company in driving long-term profitable growth and value to our shareholders. The first of these is to grow business network solutions. We expect to continue to focus on driving growth from high bandwidth data services, including MPLS, Ethernet, Wavelength, business depot, and voice-over-IP services, by providing reliable connectivity to meet the growing bandwidth needs of our business customers.","In the third quarter, we experienced continued strength in sale for high bandwidth data services. We announced expansion of our 1 gig service for business customers to 16 markets in August, which has resulted in strong small and mid-size business sales. This expansion provides increased addressable market opportunities for our business sales team and ultra-fast Ethernet quality speeds to our customers allowing them to cloud-enable their businesses.","We also believe our targeted marketing approach and a continued expansion of our sales team as well as continued enhancements in our product portfolio positions us well to drive revenue growth. For example, we are seeing continued strong sales results associated with our launch of Managed Office, a solution that integrates network, voice-over-IP, email, and other key business applications. And although slowing somewhat from the levels of last few years, we continued our fiber deployment to wireless towers to capture the growing demand from wireless carriers for data backhaul. During the third quarter, we completed fiber to approximately 1,200 towers for a total of near 21,000 fiber builds.","With respect to our cloud and hosting business, we believe we have a strong set of assets to enable us to meet the growing demand we're seeing from businesses ranging from small to global in size for cloud and hosting services. These assets, coupled with our expansive network capabilities, enable our sales teams to deliver integrated hosting and network solutions that meet the customers\u2019 needs, lower operating costs, enable them to focus on their core businesses. We continue to believe we are well positioned to compete and win in the hybrid cloud market as we offer the full range of network cloud, managed hosting, hosting co-location , and IP services that we believe our customers want.","During third quarter, we launched CenturyLinks private cloud service, which is available on the same industry recognized platform as our public cloud service, enabling new hybrid IP capabilities. This new cloud service delivers the agility and innovation of public cloud but with the physical isolation, dedicated hardware, and security standards that many large enterprises require. I believe CenturyLink is well positioned to capture the future growth of enterprise IT workload that we expect to migrate to the cloud over time whether these workloads end up in multi-tenant or dedicated cloud infrastructures.","Additionally during the quarter, we announced the rollout of our global managed hosting services in China. This expansion along with our Asia Pacific capabilities enable us to better serve multinational corporations inducting business in the world\u2019s second largest economy. We continue to enhance our ability to compete in the growth of hosting services by building and leveraging our broad IP capabilities to offer enterprise customers a complete portfolio of IP, cloud enablement, and consulting services.","Turning now to slide 8. In the consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets. We have deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. For example, since our limited gigabit services deployment in Omaha, the results continue to exceed our expectation in the consumer market and we are seeing good results in small and medium business space as well.","Along with our gigabit service expansion for businesses, we also announced the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in selected locations in 10 cities, including some of our larger markets like Minneapolis, St. Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas, and Portland and we expect to continue to expand the availability of this service in the months ahead.","We also plan to continue to invest our Prism TV capabilities and we've added more than 240,000 addressable homes year-to-date, on track to reach a total of 300,000 new Prism TV addressable homes for the full year of 2014. We do anticipate expanding Prism TV service to additional households and markets during 2015, however we're not ready to announce specific markets at this time. ","Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our NDN provisioning time and help to drive standardization. We are also focusing on improving process automation through applications and work tools that drive lower operating costs and that we expect to improve our sales efficiency. We continue to modernize our network replacing ATM with IP technology that enables high broadband speeds while also adding network capacity to serve our growing customer base. Since January, we have added over 3 terabytes to our IP backbone, bringing our total capacity to 19 terabytes per second. Also we continued to manage expenses related to our declining legacy revenue.","Lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. In recent years, we have consolidated our internal IT operations for more than 10 data centers to 4 data centers. We are also using a Cloud First approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and software-as-a-service solutions across to internal IT operations that we are selling through our cloud and IP hosting customers. We are currently on track and have average to host the vast majority of our new and strategic internal IT applications, the CenturyLink cloud instead of our internal data center.","Moving to slide 9. Effective November 1st, we've implemented and refined our organization structure to better serve our customers and drive incremental growth. We are pleased with the progress we've made toward our goal of reaching long-term growth and we believe this structure will accelerate that progress. This change combines marketing, sales and services delivery for all of our customers under one leader additional we've created an organization of single leader who is responsible for operational excellence, the NDN engineering, delivery and managing our network and data centers. We believe that these changes will strengthen our focus on revenue generation and go-to-market strategy and improve our ability of development delivering new technology and solutions by better aligning our cost structure in our revenue stream. ","This change in our organization structure are likely to result in some modification of our segment reporting that we'll determine in the coming weeks. Overall, I'm pleased with the solid results for the quarter. We've remained focused across all operating segments on offering our customers high-value products and service solutions along with high-quality of customer experience we believe creates loyalty, improves customer retention and we continue to invest in to dry growth in our business.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Stewart Ewing for looking at our financial results and fourth quarter guidance. Stew?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr.","","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude remarks with an overview of the fourth quarter 2014 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Beginning on the slide 11, I'd like to review some highlights from our solid third quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we've generated strong operating revenues and cash flows in the quarter.","Operating revenues were $4.51 billion on a consolidated basis, nearly flat from the third quarter of 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue was $4.08 billion from the third quarter, a decline of only 0.6% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 4.4% year-over-year and now represent 51% of our total revenues compared to 49% a year ago.","Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and managed hosting services continuous to drive this growth. Additionally, we entered approximately 14,000 Prism TV customers and 8,400 high-speed Internet customers during the third quarter. We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.75 billion for the third quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.7%. The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin was primarily driven by higher Customer Premise Equipment sales, higher content cost related to the growth of Prism TV and the continued decline in legacy revenues. ","Additionally, we generated $780 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow, less cash taxes paid, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income. Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.63, the high end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the quarter.","As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we have repurchased 1.7 million shares for an investment of $64 million during the third quarter. We expect to set up a program in the next few days to facilitate the purchase of shares through our fourth quarter earnings release date.","Now turning to slide 12. Third quarter 2014 operating revenues were flat to third quarter 2013 as the growth in strategic data and integration revenues was offset by lower legacy revenues due to excess live losses and lower minutes of use. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strengthened high-speed Internet, high bandwidth data business services, Prism TV and hosting services. Although legacy revenues continued to decline, the revenue decline in third quarter 2014 was 9% lower than the third quarter revenue decline a year ago.","Now turning to slide 13, I'll discuss each of our operating side with beginning with the Consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.49 billion in total revenues, which represented a decline of eight-tenth of a percent from third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year-over-year to $712 million, driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers, price increases and improved churn. ","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.6% from third quarter 2013 as access line and long distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. The comparable year-over-year decline in third quarter 2013 was 8.7%. Operating expenses increased 1% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher Prism TV cost or contact cost.","Moving to slide 14, our business segment generated $1.57 billion in operating revenues during the third quarter, which increased $25 million or 1.6% from the same period a year ago. Third quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 6.1% to $677 million from third quarter 2013, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength.","We continued to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer base and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and midsized business space to improve our market share and drive further growth. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 4.8% from third quarter of 2013, due primarily to continuing decline in access lines.","Our data integration revenues grew 13.6% in third quarter 2014 compared to third quarter 2013, driven by higher CPE sales. Total business segment expenses increased 7%, driven primarily by higher CPE costs and facility costs associated with the MPLS product growth, along with higher employee-related expenses related to additional sales resources brought in to drive future revenue growth. Our segment margin of 36.5% declined from 39.6% a year ago, this decrease was primarily due to the higher costs I just mentioned, along with continued decline in business segment legacy revenue.","Now turning to slide 15. Our wholesale segment generated $843 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 4% from the third quarter of 2013. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $560 million, down slightly from third quarter 2013 as growth in Ethernet services and wireless bandwidth expansion was offset by declines in low speed data revenues. Legacy revenues declined to 10.2% to $283 million, reflecting the continued decline in access and long distance minutes of use and the annual implementation of lower access rights, under the KF order. Operating expenses for the quarter declined $8.1 million or 2.7%, compared to the same period a year ago, driven by lower employee-related and facility costs.","Now moving to slide 16 to our hosting segment, which includes all managed hosting, cloud services, collocation and hosting related network services revenue. This segment generated $361 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 5.6% from third quarter 2013. Year-over-year managed hosting revenues including cloud grew 14%, but collocation revenue grew 4.5%. Hosting operating expenses increased $9 million or 3.5%, primarily due to higher employee cost related to the revenue growth. Overtime, we expect long-term improvement in both revenue and margin trends across the hosting segment and we continue to leverage these assets to drive additional revenue through cross selling opportunities in our other segments.","Now turning to slide 17 and our fourth quarter 2014 guidance. For fourth quarter 2014, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.44 billion to $4.49 billion. Core revenues of $4.04 billion to $4.10 billion and operating cash flow between $1.75 billion and $1.8 billion.","Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.59 to $0.64. We expect fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues to be lower than third quarter 2014, primarily due to lower data integration revenues or our CPE revenues. Core revenues are expected to be approximately inline with third quarter as the declines in legacy services are offset by growth in strategic services. Fourth quarter cash expenses are expected to decrease from third quarter primarily due to the normal seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility cost and lower CPE sales related to the anticipated decline in data integration revenues. ","Based on our revenue outlook for fourth quarter 2014, we expect total revenue results for 2014 to be approximately $40 million to $80 million above the midpoint of our original 2014 guided range, which was $18 billion, primarily driven by higher than anticipated non-recurring CPE sales. As we look forward to 2015, we continue to expect operating revenues to be approximately the same as these projected 2014 revenues. However, the increase in the rate of decline in the low speed data services revenues, which is Glen discussed earlier driven by the accelerated pace of network grooming by wholesale customers in the second half of 2014 and the higher than anticipated CPE sales in our projected 2014 revenues as mentioned above has added risk to this comparison.","We also anticipate capital expenditures for full year 2015 to be inline with our expected full year 2014 capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion. We will provide further 2015 guidance in mid-February when we report our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. ","That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. ","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, I guess first question is on the fourth quarter revenue guidance. Stewart, I guess I was looking at the data integration revenue line, and it's been elevated all year. I think every quarter you've called it out as being surprisingly strong, but it's strong every single quarter and now in fourth quarter is the quarter where you are now expecting it to maybe ease off. So, are you expecting it to be kind of flat year-over-year growth wise, or really significantly down? And if so, why?","And then this kind a goes into my next question which was, I mean, we've been looking at 2015 as the revenue inflection year for probably a couple of years now. It's been this goal you guys have really set out, you seem to be now hedging a little bit that maybe it is, maybe it isn't because of all these risk factors, one of which is CPE and the other is the narrow band contraction revenues. So, if you could talk a little bit about the driver of the narrow band issue and what was unexpected about it and kind a how you're planning on managing it to get to revenue growth for next year will be great. Thanks. ","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr.","","Yeah. So, first of all David, I\u2019ll try to get in the order that you indicated. It is forecast lower in the fourth quarter. We had a larger deal that closed in the third quarter. Fourth quarter of '13 was about $187 million, and we are expecting the fourth quarter of this year to be about $144 million. So, we do expect it to be down. We just don't have the same number of large deals into pipeline that we expect to close in the fourth quarter. In terms of 2015 being an inflection year, basically when we started talking about \u2013 we still believe first of all when we say, we still believe that we can get to the level of revenue hopefully that we will have this year in 2014, which will be higher than the midpoint of the original guidance that we gave. So, the original guidance we gave, the midpoint $18 billion.","We are going to end up probably $40 million to $80 million higher than that. So, basically that puts some challenge associated with 2015 just right out of the gate plus our CPE revenues, and it really relates to CPE revenues in 2014 being higher than 2013. So, the low speed, narrow band issue that we have seen basically really started kind of at the end of the second quarter. So, where we started seeing more disconnects than we saw in actually the first quarter and really second quarter of this year, and what it is basically is related to we're having fewer towers that we are building to because we're just about through the cycle of building fiber to the towers, and we are still seeing disconnects of the low speed circuits and they really seem to relate to; one, a customer that basically shut a network down, and secondly, towers that we were not successful in terms of obtaining the fiber-to-the-tower bills from.","So, we expect this to play out sometime probably during the first half of 2015 in terms of the rate of decline that we are seeing, and just to quantify it for you, it\u2019s probably in the -- and it's really lower than what our expectations were. It won't necessarily be lower than \u2013 it won\u2019t be that much lower than this year\u2019s revenue, but it\u2019s somewhere in the range of $50 million to $100 million or so. But we have overcome that and think we can overcome that with the improvement that we have been able to see in our business, revenue growth, and also the lower decline in our consumer revenue growth that growth that we have seen this year. So, we have offset some of that decline in effect.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","So, basically two parts to that. One is the starting point for the revenue growth kind of inflection is actually higher than what we thought it was going to be when we were talking about it at the beginning of 2014, and then we have got this narrow band issue we can overcome that with the business and consumer initiatives, and the CPE side is probably going to be relatively low margin. So at the end of the day, it's not that important to revenue stream?","Glen F. Post, III","","At the end of the day, it's not that important Dave. We will be right in the range of our 2014 revenue in 2014 plus or minus a little bit, and it may depend on how much CPE we sell. But again you've got to characterize exactly correct, the jump off point more or less or the base that we set in 2014 was higher than the midpoint when we started talking about revenue stability, and then towards the latter half of this year, we've seen a little bit weakness in the low speed connections on the wholesale side.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS","","Great, thanks. Could you also provide some color on your outlook for margins? I think you have always said that, once the revenue trends stabilize, EBITDA stability should be 12 to 18 months behind that. So, how should we think about margin outlook for 2015 and beyond? And another question on the CapEx. You are maintaining your $3 billion guidance would suggest a big ramp in 4Q, what will that mainly be spent on? And looking at 2015, wireless backhaul spending, it probably comes down, what will that be replaced with to maintain a flat level? Thanks.","Glen F. Post, III","","Yes. So Batya, the margins we think they will continue to come down slightly as we continue to lose the higher margin revenue. But again lose it at a slower rate than we've been losing it in the past. But we would still expect EBITDA to stabilize 12 to 18 months or so afterwards, assuming we can continue the rate of decline in the legacy revenue and assuming we can continue the rate of growth in our strategic revenue. And I think we haven't really called where the margins will end up but somewhere in probably the mid to upper 30s range. ","One thing if you if you look at our business margins, I mean, they were down a pretty good quarter-to-quarter, but if you back CPE out of both of the quarters the third quarter last year third quarter this year, the margins in third quarter last year were 41%, the margin this year is about 39%. So again outside of the CPE, we're getting good margins in that business. ","CapEx it is going to be somewhat higher in the fourth quarter. We have some of the network work that we are doing to try to upgrade some of our networks. We also have some data center expenditures that we're going to buy as well in the fourth quarter. So, we will just kind of catch-up a little bit in the fourth quarter with what we had expected to stand for the year.","In terms of wireless backhaul, we really don\u2019t have the details of 2015 budget laid out at this point, but we probably still have some fiber-to-the-tower builds next year and any monies that we don't spend there will probably go in our funds deployment as we try to build fiber to more business customer and more buildings to allow our customers to be able to sell high-speed data services to our customer.","Batya Levi - UBS","","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","","Great. Thanks a lot. You are saying on the CapEx, I think you said Prism would cover 300,000 households this year. You are not ready to choose markets in the next year, but having given forth to accelerating the pace of Prism? I noticed the broadband ads were somewhat light this quarter, perhaps you can sort of just talk to that as there some pressure on DSO outside of your Prism market so, what can you do to get some better growth in that? Thanks.","Glen F. Post, III","","I'll talk about the first part of your question Simon and then Karen can pursue with the units. But as we are considering acceleration of the Prism investment, here we have probably mid-year before we actually initiate service in new markets but we do expect to expand and we've identified a number of markets and we're still working with franchise with some of the cities and we are grooming our plan, getting ready for that investment will be also have with that process of bringing Prism cities, but we are expecting more move forward certainly accelerate what we have been this year.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Good.","Karen A. Puckett","","Simon, this is Karen. In terms of HS-5, I will first say that, we still have historically low churn and we are very proud of that work we have done. In terms of some of the softness, I would characterize that we have some softness in our ATM market. We have you know really taken out some of the marketing that we will do there for all the right reasons. We have to some softness in some alternative channels that we have and then this quarter we are very focused on just improving our inward ARPU and we accomplished that cost on the unit, but we are still very optimistic we have fiber-to-the-node and where we have fiber-to-the-prem. We're very competitive and can compete with cable in ATM market you know so that's a bit more challenging.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Hey, guys thanks. I guess just thinking about the couple of comments regarding prices and Karen just mentioned inwards, but how price sensitive are you finding consumers right now with respect to whether you know it's broadband or traditional telecom services? And then secondly just as thought on Prism TV I mean hearing a lot of over the top chatter and TV moving in different directions, does that changed your view on sort of longer-term where you want to take Prism TV? Thanks.","Karen A. Puckett","","In terms of the pricing, how concern consumers are, I would say the market hasn't changed a lot. It really is around the promotional that ad flows in terms of the amount sometimes per quarter. There is a lot more chatter around speed as you get especially cable where they have up their speed on their entry level programs that 60 gigs in many of our markets. On Prism, I think we are very still very optimistic about Prism over the top there is an opportunity. We continue to follow what's happening. We have the capability given our Prism foundation and content capability there and it's a matter of getting the economics right. So, we continue to be focused and look at plans to have some type of over the top offering in the future.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Karen just I guess sticking on the economics on the consumer market, the 1 gig product you're rolling out obviously it's relatively limited. But how do you think about the economic sort of on a permanent basis if you would?","Karen A. Puckett","","So, the announcement that we made actually last earnings call, we look at the opportunity. We're focused on the fiber deployment getting that cost per households deployed down, and so that range needs to be under 1,000 per households. We have the GPON that were currently rolling out that were constructing as we speak fit into those metrics very easily because it was aerial fiber and short leaves. So, that works. The bigger next step that we got to continue to get that fiber deployment done.","We've been working on a couple of different approaches and we're making progress there so that's important for our ability to rollout fiber in a bigger way. The other thing I would just mention on the fiber to the business, GPON to business really very optimistic. The sales team there is very excited, the early indicators and we just started marketing that are positive and we think that will put us in a very competitive position here in the next couple of quarters.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question Phil Cusick with JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Phil Cusick - JP Morgan","","Hey guys. Thanks. Given what sounds like a potential revenue decline in 2015, should we still think about EBITDA stability a couple of years beyond revenue or with CPE being the difference or good chunk of difference in 2015 could that time frame tighten a bit? Thanks.","Glen F. Post, III","","Yeah. Phil, we still believe we can hit hopefully 2014 revenue and 2015 into where it will be the planned. We're just saying that there is some challenges and risks getting there with what we're seeing, but we still should be able to see EBITDA stability. We think again within the periods that we've talked about of 12 to 18 months after we get revenue stability. So, hopefully after 2015.","Phil Cusick - JP Morgan","","Thanks, guys.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie Capital. Your line is open please go ahead.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital","","Yeah. How should we think about cash taxes in 2015, and assuming difference in scenarios on bonus appreciation? I know you have some amortization that's not deductible. Can you talk a little bit about the difference scenarios for cash taxes?","And then as follow up to that can we talk a little bit about priorities for use of cash next year. I think your share repurchase is a little bit lower this quarter despite the strong free cash flow. How should we think about use of cash in 2015?","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr.","","So basically in terms of cash taxes, we'll pay $50 million to $100 million of cash taxes in 2014 and really that represents virtually no federal taxes. In 2015, we would expect our cash taxes to increase somewhere in the $600 million to $700 million range on incremental basis. So $700 to $800 million or so of cash taxes in 2015. Should almost depreciation get implemented and extended basically for 2014 and 2015? We would expect our 2015 cash taxes to be maybe $50 million to $150 million higher than they are in 2014. So, maybe $150 million to $175 million next year.","Glen F. Post, III","","Kevin, this is Glen. I'll talk about the use of cash. As far as the stock buyback is concerned, we did very much progress this past quarter. We expect to be back on track in the coming quarter. As we said from the beginning we'll buy optimistically and we look each quarter but we are committed to stock buybacks. We think they are good. The money we spent on our own in the last couple a years has really been a good investment for us. So, we're pleased with that. We also are committed to our dividend. We think is well protected by our free cash flow and our dividend payout ratio this year we expect to be about 45% as we feel good about dividend.","In addition to dividend and stock buyback, we're continually waiting to make best utilize our cash. We look at additional capital expenditure opportunities we're drive growth in the business. We looking to possible debt reduction and then acquisition opportunities inorganic opportunities that can drive growth for us. But our continued focus is really on the best way is to utilize our cash to drive long-term shareholder value and that's where it\u2019s been for years and we're continue that focus. ","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Capital","","And any from further development on sort of your REIT exploration process if you will? ","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. ","","No, Kevin. We're basically going watch which streams go to their process and just see how that goes and then we'll make a decision at some point after that. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citigroup.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup ","","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could, first is, should we be thinking about the revenue impact of the inter-carrier compensation reform during the quarter in terms of moving some revenue from regulatory to retail and how much that might be in the Consumer and Business segment?","And then second question I have is, if you look at the slowdown in legacy revenue erosion, are you look by market, are you look by product? Is there a certain secret sauce that you're finding in some markets where you really start to see that slow? Is that the maybe the voice customers get to a certain level of market share or broadband capabilities get above a certain level. If you can maybe give us your sense of what's happening underneath there, that would be great. ","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. ","","So, Mike the revenue impact of the inter-carrier comp or reform is really is not that significant. It does reflect or result and a decline in our wholesale segment revenue, but that decline in the wholesale revenue segment is really pretty much offset as you'd indicated by many increases that we're able to do in the charge to our consumer and our business customers. They are charged which really virtually offsets the access to charge reductions that we're implementing. ","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","","And how much is that that moves from wholesale to retail in terms of dollars? ","R. Stewart Ewing, Jr. ","","Yeah. About $5 million a quarter or so. ","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","","Okay. ","Glen F. Post, III","","And concerning the secret sauce, we don't know if there is really a secret sauce. We look at every market individually as far as at the capabilities and that we've provided in the marketplace. We've look at bundles of services kind of price it comparatively, but we have found a level of voice customers, a level of broadband and really said it's going to slow at any point in time. We think that will happen we just don't know where that is yet. But absolutely new product and services as a bundle services where we believe it helps a lot for us in recent quarters. ","Michael Rollins - Citigroup","","Thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you, and our final question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","","Thanks. Can you talk a little bit about the cost trends in the network where you kind of seen both of deploying fibers more to the nodes and fiber to the home over the last couple of years? Thanks. ","Karen A. Puckett ","","Yeah. I think the cost trends I would say continued to improve and a lot of it is just around like I said the work that we've been doing. And we do need to continue to drive improvement in those each year, so that we can get fiber further out. But it's everything from the approach to the process and also anything around the install improvements that we can get there. So it's really an improved. ","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","","Have you seen material improvements though or can you talk about the trends a little bit on the technology that you've seeing over the last two or three years?","Karen A. Puckett","","I can't say that there has been a large increase in technology over the last couple of years. The biggest thing that helped us is really more on the Prism side the wireless set-top box. That really has changed the game for us. It improved significantly our ability on the time of install as well as the customers love it. But, I think there is one thing that you would ask us to the team that would be the number one thing.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","","Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen F. Post, III","","Thank you, Steve. Overall, we are well pleased with our solid third quarter operating and financial results. We are pleased with a continued improvement in our revenue trend.

Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss CenturyLink\u2019s second quarter 2013 results. We were very pleased with the financial results for the second quarter and the first half of this year and we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. Operating revenues for the second quarter were in line with our expectations, while operating cash flow and adjusted earnings per share were near the high end of our previous guidance. We believe our investments and our key strategic growth initiatives continue to strengthen our overall product portfolio, further positioning CenturyLink as a leading integrated provider of global network, co-location, managed hosting and cloud solutions.","Demand from business customers for high bandwidth network and data hosting services continues to drive solid sales opportunities for integrated solutions. If you\u2019ll turn to Slide 5, I\u2019d like to begin with some highlights from the second quarter. We generated solid financial results with annual strategic revenue growth of 4.1%, strength in revenue from high speed internet, high-bandwidth data services, data hosting and Prism TV were the primary drivers of this growth. Additionally, we have maintained our focus on expenses as we reduced cash expenses by $45 million or 1.7% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower personnel- and data integration costs. ","From a business market perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers across the company for network and hosting services in the second quarter. Also during the quarter we made good progress in the share repurchase program we announced in February. Through August 6, 2013 we repurchased nearly 29 million shares or 4.6% of our outstanding common stock for a total of approximately $1 billion. We have repurchased shares aggressively over the past few months and we expect to opportunistically buy back additional shares going forward. We continue to expect to complete the $2 billion repurchase by February of 2015. We still anticipate improvement in our strategic revenue growth in the second half of this year. However, we do expect this level of improvement to be slightly lower than the more aggressive growth we originally anticipated.","And finally, I\u2019m pleased we have reached a tentative agreement in contract negotiations with the Communications Workers of America in many of our -- covering many of our western states. Our focus during these negotiations has been to align the call structure and work rules under this agreement with the rest of our organization and the competitive dynamics in the market targets where we operate. ","If you turn to Slide 6, I\u2019ll provide an update on our key strategic initiatives, starting with broadband expansion and enhancement. We continue to make significant investments in this area that we believe will benefit our business and consumer customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 5.91 million broadband subscribers. We did experience the first ever decline in broadband net adds in the second quarter due to typical seasonality and lower than normal level of indirect sales. While this quarter was challenging, we do expect broadband subscriber net adds to be positive for the remainder of this year.","We believe our fiber assets position us well in the business market. In the first half of 2013 we put over 1000 of our fiber-fed multi-tenant buildings into our advanced MTU program which offers customers broadband capability of up to 500Mbps of symmetrical service and enhances cloud connectivity for these customers. In addition, we plan to leverage our existing fiber to opportunistically expand GPON capabilities into nearby high density business districts offering broadband speeds of up to 1gig. Both the MTU and GPON programs offer upstream speeds and business service level agreements beyond what is normally available with cable and they make these capabilities particularly compelling in the business market where upstream capabilities are critical to enablement of cloud services. The business areas where we do not offer our advanced MTU or GPON programs would essentially deploy Ethernet. We cover over 2 million business locations with Ethernet capability with about half of this footprint capable of 20 megabits and higher symmetrical speeds today.","In the months ahead we expect to continue making investments in our network to enhance speed capabilities required to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets. Turning now to slide seven. Our Prism TV service continues to perform well and represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV service in the markets where we offer this service. We added over 12,000 Prism TV subscribers in the second quarter ending the quarter with a total of 132,000 subscribers in service. These customers continue to have a high rate of broadband attachment, it was actually 97% in the second quarter this year. And there were 50% of these customers who were new to CenturyLink.","We now have a penetration rate of nearly 9% across the markets in which the service is available and that includes the newest markets of Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Omaha, Prism TV triple play bundled customers are significantly less likely to churn then single play voice customers. In the second quarter the churn rate for Prism TV triple play customers was over 500 basis points lower than the single play voice customers. We are pleased with the early Prism subscriber growth in Phoenix, our first legacy Qwest market in which we provided this service.","And in the second quarter we also commercially launched the service in Colorado Springs and soft launched in Omaha with or fiber-to-prim service. Additionally, we continue to enhance our IPTV features by introducing new functionality and applications including expansion of our TV Everywhere capabilities, video-on-demand library and a recent successful trial of wireless set-top boxes.","Now going to slide eight. A third key strategic initiative is investing in fiber builds to as many towers in our services areas as economically feasible. During the second quarter we completed more than 1150 fiber-to-the-tower builds for a total of over 16,700 across our footprint. We currently expect to complete a total of 4000 to 5000 builds in 2013. As we have discussed with you before, we are experiencing some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper based DS1 facilities to fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we anticipate that wireless data bandwidth growth will result in expansion of Ethernet consumption reversing the current revenue compression during 2014.","Now moving on to slide nine, in managed hosting and cloud services. We continue to believe we are well positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in this space where we have developed and are expanding our strong product offering for businesses of all sizes. We continue to build upon solid momentum of the past two quarters with solid new sales again this quarter. Cross-sell or team selling opportunities for hosting products across our hosting and networks sales teams continues to be strong with sales of hosting services to business customers steadily growing. We also continue to invest to increase our data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity.","In the second quarter, we opened a new data center in London, adding approximately 25,000 square feet of saleable floor space. And for full year 2013, we continue to expect to add a total of approximately 87,000 saleable square feet of which over 57,000 has been added in the first half of the year. Our recent acquisition of AppFog, a rapidly growing platform-as-a-service provider used by more than 100,000 developers who have deployed over 150,000 applications, represents an excellent addition to our Savvis cloud service suite. We are offering multiple programming languages and interoperability between public and private cloud environments. And AppFog delivers a reliable, scalable and fast platform for developing apps in the cloud.","Combining AppFog's market leading platform-as-a-service capability with our industry-leading infrastructure-as-a-service, Savvis cloud services and our global network, CenturyLink will enable the developers to securely and reliably operate and connect to applications they build and deploy. We look forward to making the full suite of AppFog services available to both our existing and perspective customers in the weeks ahead.","Finally, in June Savvis was recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for our European Managed Hosting, another confirmation of CenturyLink\u2019s global leadership position in managed hosting. Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the financial results for the quarter. We continue to invest to drive growth and are experiencing good traction in those key areas.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results.","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the first quarter and full year 2013 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Starting on Slide 11, beginning this quarter, we\u2019re providing guidance on core revenues. Core revenues reflect the two largest contributors to operating revenues, our strategic revenues and legacy revenues. Strategic and legacy revenues account for approximately 91% of total revenues and are primarily recurring in nature. Core revenues exclude revenues from data integration, which includes primarily customer premise equipment sales and related maintenance and other revenues which includes primarily universal service receipts.","As you can see in the chart on Slide 11, the green line represents the annual percent change for core revenues while the orange line represents the annual percent change for total revenues. The core revenue trend has improved from a 3.2% decline in pro forma 2011 to 2.3% decline in 2012 and we expect further improvement in 2013 with a decline of 0.9% to 1.5%. we believe this trend is a more accurate reflection of the underlying business as it takes out the noise of changing USF contribution rates and the lower margin CPE business.","Turning to slide 12, with that, let\u2019s move to our results for the second quarter. I\u2019ll be reviewing the results, excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. As you can see, we generated solid operating revenues and cash flows in the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.53 billion on a consolidated basis and this represents a 1.9% decline from second quarter 2012 operating revenues.","Our core revenues were $4.11 billion for second quarter, a decline of 1.6% from the year ago period. Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 48% of total revenue from 45% in the second quarter a year ago due to growth in strategic products such as high-speed internet, high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and Managed Hosting Services.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.69. As we\u2019ve discussed on prior calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.","Total cash operating expenses declined from second quarter 2012 to second quarter 2013. This decline was primarily the result of lower personnel related and data integration costs.","We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.86 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 41.1%. Additionally, we generated $703 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income. Our strong cash flows continue to provide us with financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to slide 13, the decline in second quarter 2013 operating revenues compared to second quarter a year ago, was primarily a result of growth in strategic revenues that was more than offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed internet, high-bandwidth business data services and our data hosting services.","Now turning to Slide 14 which is our consumer segment. I\u2019ll discuss each of the operating segments, beginning with consumer. Consumer generated $1.4 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 3% over second quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year over year to $628 million. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 8.7% from second quarter 2012 due primarily to a continued decline in access lines long distance revenues partially mitigated by implementation of the access recovery charge in July of 2012. Expenses in this segment declined $17 million or 3% during second quarter compared to the same period a year ago, driven mainly by lower bad debt expense, network and facility costs, which were partially offset by higher costs associated with our Prism TV product.","Moving to slide 15. Our business segment generated $1.53 billion in operating revenues during the second quarter which were slightly below revenues from the same year ago period. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased by 4.6% to $617 million from second quarter 2012, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength. Excluding low bandwidth services, strategic revenue grew nearly 10% from a year ago.","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 4.9% from second quarter 2012 due primarily to a continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues, partially mitigated by the implementation of the excess recovery charge in mid-year 2012. The total segment expenses declined $6 million, driven by lower data integration and network cost, partially offset by higher facility cost.","Now turning to slide 16. Our wholesale segment generated $910 million in operating revenues, a decline of 3.8% from second quarter 2012. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $572 million, nearly flat from second quarter 2012, as declining low speed transport services revenue offset growth in Ethernet services and data bandwidth capacity expansion by the wireless carriers. Legacy revenues declined by 9% to $338 million reflecting the continued decline in access and long-distance minutes of use and the implementation of lower access rates under the CAF Order rate step down.","Our operating expenses for the quarter in this segment were $301 million, 3.8% below the same period a year ago, driven primarily by lower facility cost. Now moving to slide 17 and our data hosting segment, which includes all colocation, managed hosting, cloud services and hosting related network services revenue. This segment generated $347 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 7.4% from second quarter 2012 revenues of $323 million. This growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 2.1% in colocation revenues and 20.7% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues.","Second quarter 2013 revenues included approximately $15 million of revenue contribution from the Ciber IT outsourcing assets acquired in October 2012. Excluding this revenue, managed hosting revenue grew 7.4% year-over-year. Data hosting revenues also grew 4% sequentially from first quarter this year driven by strength in the managed hosting products. Data hosting operating expenses were $273 million in second quarter compared to $239 million in second quarter 2012. This increase of 14% is driven by added data center expansion, operations and sales and marketing headcount to support revenue growth, including headcount for savvisdirect, and enabling sales channels along with expenses related to the acquisition of the Ciber ITO assets not present in the prior year period.","Turning to slide 18, we provide our third quarter and full-year 2013 guidance. For the third quarter 2013, we expect total operating revenues of $4.5 billion to $4.55 billion. And core revenues of $4.09 billion to $4.14 billion and operating cash flow between $1.79 billion and $1.83 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be in a range from $0.59 to $0.64. Our anticipated sequential decline in third quarter operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS compared to second quarter results is primarily due to higher seasonal expenses we typical incur in the third quarter each year associated with our outside plants maintenance and utility costs and increased costs related to our continued investment in key initiatives. ","For the full year 2013, the company has updated its guidance to reflect year to date results as well as updated expectations for the remainder of the year. Full year revenues guidance has been lowered slightly to $18.05 billion to $18.2 billion. Although our first half results were in line with our previous expectations and our second half forecast reflects improved growth rates for total revenues, we anticipate that these levels of growth will be slightly lower than the more aggressive amounts we originally anticipated. Some of the primary drivers of this reduced level of growth in the second half of the year are slower acceleration in data hosting revenue growth rates, a faster rate of decline in our low bandwidth services and lower than originally anticipated federal universal service of contribution rates which really is a flow-through item. ","This level of revenue growth in the second half of 2013, although still reflecting a positive trend in growth rates, is lower than our original projections and we believe will likely result in a slight decline in 2014 total revenues compared to 2013. Additionally, we have tightened the ranges for operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS. Even with the revision to our revenue guidance, these new projections for operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS are better than our original 2013 projections due to our control of cash expenses during the year and the impact of our share repurchases.","We also expect capital expenditures to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion due to increased investment in broadband capacity, higher than expected success-based business sales and an increase in new sub-division Greenfield fiber bills. This increased capital investment also influenced the revision in our free cash flow guidance for the year.","This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I\u2019ll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Stewart, 90 days ago, you guys came out and raised the expectations for the business. And then now we're taking them back down actually pretty much to where they started on EBITDA, but a little bit lower on revenues. And we had this line in the sand for trying to get to flattish revenues for a long time in 2014. So something over the last 90 days seems to have really dramatically changed to back away from these longstanding targets. And I guess obviously everyone is going to run around with their hair on fire until we find out what it is. Can you elaborate on what's going on? That would be great. ","Stewart Ewing","David, I think the primary things affecting the latter half of the year, number one, the (inaudible) rate is down. So that contributes somewhat to the decline in revenue.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Can you quantify that Stewart? How much of that change is related to that?","Stewart Ewing","It\u2019s probably about $20 million or so. The other -- let me get it David, just a second. $25 million to $30 million, David. And then, I guess the other things affecting the last half of the year really is the Savvisdirect product that we rolled out. The sales channel through the Internet has not materialized as quickly as we had hoped. We've done a good job we think with Savvis in terms of cross-selling the Savvis products into -- and gaining momentum there in the second quarter and expecting to gain some more momentum in the third quarter, but Savvisdirect, probably about $20 million below what we had hoped the second half of the year to be. And then our lower speed products, lower bandwidth products, probably about $30 million or so there. Primarily, again, related to a little bit faster conversion of our fiber-to-the-tower where we are disconnecting the copper circuits and seeing some of the compression a little bit quicker than we had anticipated. So those are really the three primary items that are affecting the latter half of the year.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess, sort of as a follow-up to that. I mean as we kind of lower the EBITDA expectation and raise the CapEx expectation. I mean this is kind of the scenario that you don\u2019t want to see for a dividend paying company if it kind of continues along these trends. So if you look into the back half of the year, what are upside surprises, what are the -- as you look into your next 90 days, what are the downside surprises that could potentially emerge here?","Stewart Ewing","As -- frankly, we have got everything built in. Jim, we lowered the EBITDA but we lowered it basically back to where we started it first of the year and then in fact we have got costs in the latter half of the year associated with some of the growth initiatives. And we think they are in fact starting to drive revenue. We are starting to see some of that effect. And we just don\u2019t want to back down from the standpoint of reducing the expenses associated with that. On the CapEx side, most of the incremental CapEx where we effectively raised, it got us maybe [$50 million] or so, thereby closing the gap from $2.8 billion to $3 billion to $2.9 billion to $3 billion. It's more associated with success that we are having on the customer side and the business segment, as well as new home developments or new subdivision developments, which hopefully again over the long term will translate into revenue opportunities for customers in those areas because we are putting fiber in most of those subdivisions to enable more high bandwidth services to those areas.","The third area was basically just capacity growth within the network just for normal growth and due to really our customers using video streaming more, as they are across the rest of the industry as well. So again, not a significant increase there. And two out of three of those really should result in increased revenue over time and the third increase in bandwidth should help us with our being able to add new high-speed internet customers and maintain the customers that we have.","David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, thanks, Stewart. And I could just, this is my last one, is just given that you are chewing through the buyback so quickly, are you willing to keep your kind of foot on the gas on that buyback? Or given that you are kind of moving into the second billion dollars already, are you going to slow it down?","Glen Post","David, I think that depends on where stock price goes. We essentially have been using all of our free cash flow to repurchase shares. And in fact that's where the incremental free cash flow has gone in the first six months of the year. And I think it just really depends. We'll be opportunistic in the latter half of the year and next year and we'll -- it really again just depends on the stock price.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Deutsche Bank.","Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank","I was hoping we could dig into the broadband sub losses a little bit. Just a couple of questions there. So first of all on the seasonality. Could you just remind us, is the seasonal slowdown typically a function of gross adds or churn and to what extent were those similar or different than what you've usually seen. I'm also interested in the impact of the indirect channel. Maybe just explain a little more happened there? And then the last question is, of the customers that you are losing, are you seeing any consistency, for example, they tend to be lower speed customers as opposed to higher speed customers?","Karen Puckett","Hi, this is Karen Puckett. In terms of seasonality. Seasonality, as we've grown in with the Qwest acquisition we have more snowbird type states and so we did have a lot of a success with snowbirds in terms of getting them in. Typically that's people going back to the Northeast or to the Midwest as well college students. So that's typical in terms, and we pretty much told in last call that upcoming with seasonality. On the indirect side we have a particular partner that basically had some underperformance relative to churn rates and that caught us. In terms of the churn to lower, what I would say is the footprint, if we look at our fiber-to-the-node footprint, we certainly have better churn in closed rates than we do on our ATM footprint. So that is a fact. But we now have 7.4 million households on our fiber-to-the-node product.","Brett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank","So as you think about the back half of the year, you obviously get a seasonal boost in the third quarter. Is that the principal reason why you\u2019re optimistic you'll return to growth or are there any other things going on that should help that through the balance of the year?","Karen Puckett","We\u2019re pretty good on execution on high speed. We have a good track record. So I\u2019m confident that we will be back positive. Obviously, the back half of the year we don't have the seasonal situation. And we always have our plans in place to know pretty much every day where the levers are. So we\u2019re confident on the back half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","I guess two things on the revenue side. First on Prism, can you give us an update there? You talked about higher investment in the second half. Is that a little bit more Prism efforts? And then second on the revenue in '14, should we still -- is it still fair to expect that at some point in '14 revenue grows sequentially quarter-to-quarter or should we be still sitting and watching it track down through '14? Thanks.","Glen Post","Your last question, I guess, in terms of revenue, I guess we\u2019re not ready to put a stake in the ground in terms of quarter-to-quarter 2014. But we think we\u2019ll be able to give more guidance there, certainly not at the end of the third quarter, but at the end of the fourth quarter as we normally do. But again we\u2019re tweaking our revenue guidance a little bit. It\u2019s not significant in terms of the real aggregate dollar change. In terms of Prism TV, there\u2019s really not any additional CapEx on Prism TV in the second half for the most part. There may be a little bit of increased expenses because we continue to roll out more areas in the Phoenix market and also the Omaha markets and Colorado Springs. So there may be slightly increased expenses associated with Prism in the back half of the year compared with the first half.","Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan","And then as we -- despite a little bit of a revenue downtick, we're getting closer to revenue being flat at this point. Is there a significant change in your mindset when you reach that flat revenue? Does that open things up strategically for you a little bit more, whether that's acquiring other companies or being little more aggressive in terms of investing in the business?","Glen Post","Phil, I\u2019m not sure it opens things up necessarily. We're focused right now on our key growth areas, growth objectives, growth strategies as we have been. We believe that there is significant growth there. We don't think we have to acquire in order to drive growth. And with our stock price being suppressed, we believe undervalued right now, obviously that makes a large transaction difficult today. That being said, we will continue to consider inorganic opportunities, but we will maintain our very disciplined approach in making those decisions. So we\u2019d see now what the opportunities are. And then obviously I think if you turn to revenue -- the revenue dynamics around and see revenue flat and eventual growth and certainly the stock price should follow that. But that is obviously a major factor here in larger acquisition decisions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Wonder if we could just talk a little bit more about savvisdirect. Could you just do a little bit of diagnostic on what was the reasons behind the shortfall? Was it the timing of the product? Was it pricing? Or what are the feedbacks you\u2019re getting in terms of why that didn't ramp? And is that something that is just delayed a couple of quarters, we should see that benefit in '14? And then on the union deal, I understand it's not ratified, but is there anything in your 2013 guidance set out for benefits from that or is that all likely to flow through in 2014?","Jeff Von Deylen","Hi Simon. This is Jeff Von Deylen. I'll take the one on Savvisdirect and then pass it Glen or Stewart on the union question. On savvisdirect, clearly that product is set to -- we really rolled that out to deliver an online and web channel platform which we didn't have in the legacy Savvis cloud platform. It was more of an enterprise play. So, I think that market is difficult in terms of adoption rate and we are behind some of what is pretty aggressive ramp up in growth in the second half of the year. So I think it's the right platform, the right capabilities, I just think the uptake and penetration is slower than original plan.","We also think that AppFog, frankly, that acquisition is really strategic to our cloud platform. Especially as we think about the enterprise which is where our hosting services play best. So, we're really looking at AppFog with developers together with our entire suite of Savvis could products, to really give us an opportunity to talk to enterprises, and the developers in the enterprises where we weren't able to talk to before, to accelerate more of that cloud play. So, we're short on the online and web but frankly think that the play with the developer and strengthening our enterprise portfolio is the right move for us.","Stewart Ewing","Regarding the union, we have not factored in any benefit or cost in our forecast for rest of the year, Simon.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS","Just one more follow-up on the guidance question. The low end of the new revenue guidance is outside of the prior range. So, does this change mean that you expect to come in at the low end of the guidance in terms of revenues, or how could that sort of change throughout the second half? And second question on the cost side, you mentioned that you still have more cost cutting initiatives. Can you provide more color on where they could come from and how do you think about margins going forward?","Stewart Ewing","So, Batya, the low end of the guidance being outside of the prior range does not mean that we basically are targeting the low end of the range. One of the reasons we lowered the top end is because of the (inaudible) rate, which again is probably $30 million or so of short fall in the second half of the year. So, it shouldn't be an indication that we expect to come in at the low end of the range. In terms of other cost saving opportunities, I guess we have been saying the last few quarters that we think our margins will continue to come down slightly. We have been able to through managing the cost, been able to keep them fairly flat. But I would think that we would still say that just with the margin compression that you see with losing the higher margin revenue and substituting for that the lower margin revenue from some of the services that we are growing. Basically, you would see some margin compression over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer","Obviously, you have a balancing act here between stock buybacks and CapEx and I know you are spending at the much higher range than your peers. But can you think if you spend a bit more on CapEx to get more the fiber-out-to-node a little faster, that could help the growth rate. And it seems like it would be pretty high return on invested capital. Just kind of curious on your thought process balancing that out?","Glen Post","Yeah, Tim, this is Glen. We debate that on a continual basis. So balancing that how much we spend on CapEx. But, yes, there is no question you can pop more growth by building more fiber, fiber deeper. The question is, what your returns are overall and what's the best use of capital. Capital allocation is one of the most difficult decision I think our entire industry faces. And one of the potential items when you look at fiber-to-the-node or fiber deeper in the network and then fiber-to-the-prim, fiber-to-the-businesses and to use, those are all part of the decision making process. And what we look at is trying to invest in the areas that can drive the most growth and also have the solid margins. And that's what we're looking at. So, that's a continual decision process for us really.","Operator","(Operator instructions). Our next question comes from Alex (inaudible) from Raymond James.","Frank Louthan \u2013 Raymond James","It's actually Frank who made it to the call. Quick question, looking at the Savvis business, it looks like the co-location growth is about 2% year-over-year. Can you talk us about what's going on there? It just seems like it\u2019s maybe not getting as much traction as you maybe had expected. Is there anything structurally there going on or anything from a market perspective or demand perspective that you're seeing? What\u2019s driving that growth rate there?","Jeff Von Deylen","Hi Frank, Jeff again. On co-lo, I think one of the things we continue to manage through is some large -- we talked about this I think in the last call, some large customer churn events. We've got customers like eBay, Yahoo who are building their own data centers. They are existing customers. They are ultimately going to exit our data centers. So it's about managing them out and then our fill rate back in. So we still feel good about that business and that market. I think we have a tremendous opportunity to add more what I'll call retail customers into that and especially the -- as Glen talked about, the teeming success of the CenturyLink customers. So you'll see us continue to expand our footprint in co-location. It will likely be in markets that are legacy network sites like Minnesota, like Arizona, like North Carolina. So I think we feel good about the market. I think our customer mix is changing. We think that's a higher value and a better margin customer. But we've got to manage through some larger end customers who have built out their own facilities.","Glen Post","I might just add to that. Frank, if you look at our cloud services growth is close to 25% and our managed services is the high teens. So it\u2019s really some of the local network side that was slower and the co-lo side that was slower growth for us. And we have not invested as heavily from a CapEx standpoint in -- with data centers as some of the company sales. So we don't expect to have the 15% growth in co-lo side because we don't believe the return is good there long-term as some of the other opportunities we have.","Frank Louthan \u2013 Raymond James","Then look at the Connect America Fund money you've been offered, any thoughts on how much of that looks attractive to you, how much you think you might be taking or when you might be able to give us an update on that?","Glen Post","Could you repeat that question?","Frank Louthan \u2013 Raymond James","Looking at some of the new Connect America Fund money that's been offered, the new second release of CAF 1, any thoughts on how much of what you\u2019ve been allocated? Do you think that you all will choose or any update on when you might be able to give us an update on when you might determine how much of that is available to you you'd be willing to take?","Glen Post","Frank, we expect to have a significant amount available under CAF 2, probably in excess of $400 million. We\u2019re not sure yet. That's just an estimate there. It depends on what their terms are. We are hearing pretty positive feedback from the FCC that they really want to encourage investment in low density rural areas. So we\u2019re hopeful that that could be a catalyst for us and as far as expanding our investment in areas that are under served or unserved really today. On the CAF -- latest CAF 1, we were allocated $90 million. We\u2019re not sure how much of that we\u2019ll spend, but we are looking at that as we speak, and we'll spend quite a bit of that in the next year or so.","Stewart Ewing","We have the FCC in late August.","Operator","And our final question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi","I was wondering, if you guys could talk a little bit more longer term about ideally how big you want to see Prism within your footprint in terms of homes path. And is there a way of thinking about if you want to get to that point, what the investment implications of that would be?","Glen Post","Mike, we certainly look at that and it's really success based from our standpoint. We've said before, we want to see how Phoenix and Colorado Springs doe in these larger markets and we have Omaha with the gig service now. And we'll make decisions after that. We think around 30% or more of our access lines are suitable for our Prism service. So, that what's on our radar right now. We continue to look at compression technologies and other ways to make that footprint even larger. But if we continue to see success in Phoenix and Colorado Springs then we will have more reasons to go after other markets more quickly.","Operator","Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. Please turn to slide 24 as we close today's call. Overall, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter. We believe our continued investment in key strategic opportunities continued to help us drive revenue growth and strong financial results and will over time. Our strategic product and services development continue to strengthen CenturyLink's competitive position, and our guidance reflects our expectation that our revenues in these strategic services will continue to grow. The expansion of our Prism TV service and the recent launch of managed hosting and cloud services for small and midsize businesses will further strengthen the product portfolio and should provide us additional revenue growth opportunities in 2013 and beyond.","And lastly, we are pleased with the progress we've made in the share repurchase program since inception in mid-February, and we will continue that program in the months ahead. Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Sayed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2012 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A. ","On Slide 2, you find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for second quarter and full year 2012, the integration of Qwest and Savvis and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Anyone listening to a tape or webcast replay or reading a transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of May 9, 2012, and should be considered valid only as of this date regardless of the date heard or reviewed. ","As we move to Slide 4, I will now turn the call over to your host today, Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2012 performance and review our strategic focus areas for the months ahead. ","For the past few quarters, we've outlined our plan to continue to move toward revenue stability, stable cash flow and further growth. That plan includes investing in key strategic initiatives, broadband expansion enhancement, Prism TV, fiber-to-the-tower and Managed Hosting and Cloud Computing services, areas that we believe provide the best opportunities for future revenue growth. We're executing well on this plan and remain focused on continuing this progress in the months ahead. ","Now turning to Slide 5. During the quarter, we made good progress in improving our top line revenue trend. We generated over $4.61 billion, a 2.7% year-over-year decline, comparing favorably to the 3.6% decline from the first quarter 2011 and a 3.2% decline from the pro forma fourth quarter 2011. Full year 2012, we remain on track to reduce our annual revenue rate of decline to between 1.5% to 2.5%. ","Business customers now drive about 60% of our total operating revenues. Our focus on delivering advanced solutions and data hosting services to businesses are key factors in improving our top line revenue trend. Also in the first quarter, we achieved further access line loss improvement and strong broadband subscriber growth, and we continue to scale our Prism TV service in the 8 markets where it is currently available. ","The integrations of Qwest and Savvis remain on track, and we will continue to leverage these assets to strengthen our competitive position. Due to the -- to better-than-expected synergy achievement and better visibility related to the Qwest acquisition, we have raised our annual operating expense synergy target to $650 million from $575 million, an increase of 13%. As of the end of the quarter, we have achieved an annual synergy run rate of $340 million related to the Qwest integration. Now we expect to end 2012 with an annual synergy run rate of about $465 million. Still, we'll provide additional color around the Qwest synergy target increase a little later in the call. ","To more effectively leverage the strategic assets obtained from the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis acquisitions, we announced the restructuring of our operating groups in March. Effective April 1 this year, we consolidated our organizations focused on business and government customer segments into 2 organizations: the Enterprise Markets Group, or EMG, and Regional Markets Group or RMG. EMG is led by Jim Ousley and serves national and international business customers that operate primarily outside of local market areas, along with Savvis customers and Federal Government customers. Regional and local business customers that operate primarily in our local market areas and state and local government customers are now served by Regions -- Regional Markets Group, which Karen Puckett continues to lead. The Wholesale Markets Group, led by Bill Cheek, continues to serve our wholesale international customers. They also now provide sales and support for the Savvis wholesale carrier customers. We believe this structure provides a more integrated approach that will allow us to serve our business and government customers more effectively and competitively, and it underscores the strategic rationale for the acquisitions we made the past few years. ","Moving to Slide 6, I'll provide a few highlights regarding these 4 key strategic initiatives. Our first quarter results reflect the solid progress we're making in these key areas. During the quarter, we continued our disciplined investment in broadband expansion enhancement, in Prism TV, our fiber-to-the-tower and in Managed Hosting and cloud services. Now first, we continue to make significant investments in the expansion enhancement of our broadband network. During the first quarter, we added over 89,000 high-speed Internet customers. Our customer retention efforts and the benefit of bundling broadband with products and services resulted in the continued decline of the rate of access line losses in our business. We improved from 7.6% at first quarter 2011 to 6.4% at first quarter 2012. But we also expanded our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure to an additional 175,000 living units during the quarter and now pass nearly 6.3 million living units with fiber-to-the-node, and we expect to pass about 7.1 million living units by year end. Also in late first quarter, we rolled out simplified packages for higher-speed Ethernet, bundled with voice over IP and IT services targeted to our SMB customers. Early indicators were encouraging with positive market feedback as this bundling is simple and compelling and begins to position us for further provisioning of IT services in the SMB market. ","As a result of our network investment enhancements, broadband speed availability has continued to improve. Nearly 70% of enabled lines receive speeds of 6 megabits or higher now, almost 55% of enabled lines receive 10 megabits or higher and over 25% have speeds of 20 megabits or higher. We expect to continue to make investments in our network to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets in the months ahead. ","Second, our Prism TV service represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV services in the 8 markets where it is currently available. We remain focused on expanding our Prism TV-enabled footprint and on driving additional subscriber growth in the months ahead. Our Prism product continues to perform well. We added nearly 15,000 Prism subscribers during the first quarter, 55% of which are new to CenturyLink. We now have a penetration rate of over 8% across the 8 markets in which this service is available. Prism TV continues to have a positive impact on churn and line loss trends, and we experience greater than 90% broadband pull-through rate with our Prism sales to new customers. We continue to see an annualized 350- to 400-basis-point improvement in churn for our customers taking the Prism product. We remain on track to launch Prism TV in our first legacy Qwest market in the coming months. ","Continuing on to Slide 7. Our third quarter -- our third key strategic initiative is investing in fiber builds to as many towers in our service areas as economically feasible. This initiative supports anticipated long-term growth in data transport, most of which is driven by wireless data traffic, and it expands our addressable customer footprint by enabling fiber access points to other strategic locations, where viable, along these routes. Through the first quarter, we completed 650 fiber builds. This is in line with expectations. And we continue to anticipate completing 4,000 to 5,000 builds in 2012 as fiber-to-the-tower construction continues to ramp up through the remainder of the year. Now we believe our fiber-to-the-tower program solidifies our wholesale special access revenue for the long term, and you can see a stabilization of our revenue trend. ","As we have discussed with you before, we do expect some near-term revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper-based DS1 backhaul facilities to fiber-based Ethernet backhaul services. However, we believe the continued acceleration in wireless data consumption will drive increases in Ethernet service revenues that will offset any revenue compression within a reasonable period of time and provide solid growth over the 7- to 10-year lives of the associated contracts. ","And finally, we continue to invest in Managed Hosting and cloud services to increase data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. During the first quarter, Savvis bookings were strong once again, growing 26% from the year ago period and comparable to the fourth quarter '11, which had the highest bookings level since first quarter 2008. Additionally, to further expand our global presence, we announced a joint venture with Digital Realty Trust to build a data center in the Hong Kong financial district, and we launched Savvis cloud products in both Hong Kong and Japan. We're also adding a data center in Singapore that will enhance our ability to provide service in the Asia region and better meet the needs of our global clients. Also, our Savvis Operating Group was provisionally selected by several third-party global IT service providers and financial service companies to provide their cloud and hosting services to help transform their existing IT infrastructure into more agile, cost-effective computing environments. We also gained traction in cross-selling opportunities for our Savvis product to our existing enterprise customers through our RMG and BMG segments. For example, several existing network customers now have signed agreements for Savvis hosting services. We expect further improvement in this key effort in the second quarter and beyond. Finally, we ended the first quarter with 51 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia with total salable square -- salable floor space of 1.36 million square feet. ","In summary, I am pleased with the first quarter financial results, which were supported by strong customer metrics. We continue to improve our top line revenue trends as we move toward revenue stabilization and eventual growth. Our employees did a very good job of containing costs, and we generated strong cash flow during the quarter. We also reduced our access line losses by more than 20% compared to pro forma first quarter 2011 and 6% compared to fourth quarter 2011 and grew our high-speed Internet customers by nearly 90,000 subscribers. And we made some solid progress on our key strategic initiatives that we believe position us well as we continue to improve our top line revenue trends in the months and years ahead. With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results.","R. Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the first quarter, and then I'll provide a brief liability management update and conclude my remarks with an overview of the second quarter and full year 2012 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. ","Turning to Slide 10. First, in order to provide more relevant comparisons, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Qwest and Savvis were fully included in the results for all periods. I'll also be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. Additionally, this quarter, we continued to report 4 operating segments: RMG, BMG, WMG and Savvis. Next quarter, we'll continue to report 4 segments. However, they will be realigned to report under the new operating structure we announced in late March, which are the Enterprise Managements Group, which will include 2 segments, Network Services and Data Hosting Services, and the Regional Market Group and the Wholesale Markets Group. When we report second quarter results in early August, we plan to publish historical quarterly segment financial information along the new reporting lines as outlined in more detail in the earnings release. With that, let's turn our results -- to our results for the first quarter. ","As you can see, we generated strong operating cash flows and solid cash flows during the first quarter. Operating revenues were $4.61 billion on a consolidated basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter and represent a 2.7% decline from pro forma first quarter 2011 operating revenues. This also represents a solid improvement from the 3.6% annual decline in the year ago period. Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 45% of total revenue from 42% of total revenue in first quarter a year ago. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for first quarter was $0.68, exceeding guidance by $0.05, which was driven by lower-than-anticipated depreciation, professional services and operating tax expenses, the timing of certain hardware and software maintenance contracts, as well as higher-than-anticipated capitalized expenses. Adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments, as we have discussed during prior earnings calls. ","Total cash operating expenses declined modestly from our pro forma first quarter 2011 to first quarter 2012 with synergy achievement and other cost reductions partially offset by continued investments in our key strategic initiatives. We generated solid operating cash flow of approximately $1.94 billion for the first quarter, about $40 million above the top of our prior guidance, and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 42.2%. Additionally, we generated $1.04 billion of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash taxes paid, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income. Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. ","Now turning to Slide 11, I'll begin my operating segments discussion today with our Regional Markets Group. Regional Markets Group generated $2.2 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 4.1% over pro forma first quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $764 million in the quarter, up 3.9% pro forma year-over-year. Legacy services revenues for the segment declined $124 million, or 8.1% from pro forma first quarter 2011, due primarily to a continuing decline in revenues related to access lines. However, this 8.1% decline represents a solid improvement over the 9.4% year-over-year decline in legacy revenues in pro forma first quarter 2011. Our expense reductions for the first quarter compared to the previous year were mainly driven by lower employee-related expenses, professional fees and marketing and advertising costs, which were partially offset by higher Prism TV expenses. ","Moving to Slide 12. Our Business Markets Group generated $917 million in operating revenues during the first quarter, which represented a decrease of 1.3% from pro forma first quarter 2011. That said, excluding data integration revenues, the year-over-year decline in BMG operating revenues for the quarter was only 4\/10 of 1%. First quarter strategic revenues for BMG increased by $13 million, or 3%, to $450 million from pro forma first quarter 2011, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services, such as Ethernet, MPLS and DWDM. Excluding low-speed Private Line Services, which were in decline as customers migrate to higher-bandwidth services, strategic revenue grew nearly 8% from the pro forma year ago period. ","Legacy revenue for BMG declined by $16 million from pro forma first quarter 2011 due primarily to declines in local and legacy WAN services, while data integration revenues decreased $9 million, or 7%, due to lower equipment sales and professional services revenues. Our total segment expenses in BMG increased by 9.6% to $581 million for first quarter 2012 as we experienced higher expenses related primarily to the expansion of sales resources and increased network allocations from RMG. ","Moving to Slide 13. Our Wholesale Markets Group generated $957 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 4.2% from pro forma first quarter 2011 as access and long-distance revenues continued to decline but were partially offset by wireless and other wholesale carrier bandwidth revenue growth during the quarter. Strategic revenues for WMG grew 4.2% to $576 million from pro forma first quarter 2011 primarily driven by continued strong data transport demand from wireless providers. WMG's legacy revenues declined by 14.6% to $381 million, reflecting the continued decline in access revenues. WMG's operating expenses for the quarter were $278 million, 4.1% below the pro forma period from the prior year. The decline was primarily due to lower professional fees and reduced headcount. ","Now turning to Slide 14 and our Savvis Operating Group. Savvis generated $266 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 3.9% from pro forma first quarter 2011 revenues of $256 million. This growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 4% in colocation revenues and over 7.5% in Managed Hosting and cloud services revenues, which were partially offset by a 1.5% decline in Network Services revenues. Savvis' strong fourth quarter 2011 bookings, which we discussed last quarter, helped drive this revenue growth in first quarter, and we believe the continued strong Savvis bookings in the first quarter provide a solid provisioning funnel to support continued revenue growth in the second quarter. Savvis' operating expenses were $209 million in the first quarter compared to $190 million in pro forma first quarter 2011. This increase of 10% is driven by the expansion of data center operations and additional sales and marketing staff to support revenue growth. ","As shown on Slide 15, we continue to make good progress on our $1.5 billion to $2 billion gross debt repayment program. In 2011, we set a target to repay $1.5 billion to $2 billion of gross debt on a pro forma basis over the 2-year period ending December 31, 2012. We remain on track to reach this goal as we've accomplished approximately $1 billion of our target through the first quarter. Recent liability management actions have extended the weighted average maturity of our debt by approximately 2 years and slightly decreased our weighted average interest rate. ","The chart illustrates the change in annual debt maturities. As you can see, these recent actions position CenturyLink well from a debt maturity standpoint through 2017. As a result of the refinancing and debt reductions over the last several months, we currently expect interest expense to decline modestly each quarter through the remainder of 2012. ","Slide 16 addresses our second quarter and full year 2012 guidance. For the second quarter 2012, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.55 billion to $4.6 billion and operating cash flow between $1.86 billion and $1.91 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.59 to $0.64. For full year 2012, the previously provided guidance for operating revenues, free cash flow and capital expenditures remains unchanged from the previous guidance we gave when we reported fourth quarter 2011 earnings. However, primarily as a result of our lower-than-anticipated first quarter operating expenses, we now expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.65 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.35 to $2.55. Lastly, as Glen mentioned earlier, we've increased our annual run rate operating expense synergy from the Qwest acquisition to $650 million from $575 million. The majority of this $75 million increase is driven by non-personnel-related costs, primarily in RMG, finance and Network Services areas. That concludes our prepared remarks. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just if I could, quickly, Glen, could you go into a little bit more behind the rationale for the restructuring? I guess Chris has left and now, Jim, I think you're going to be taking over a larger swath of responsibilities. What are the specific benefits that are supposed to come out of that and is that part of the synergy guidance change? And then second, Stewart, could you refresh us or remind us kind of where your net operating loss tax carryforward now stands? And as you look out into the future, how many years are you now thinking that you'll be shielded from taxes under the current regime?","Glen F. Post","First of all, regarding the rationale for the organization change, first of all, we have a lot of common customers between our BMG -- legacy BMG group and our Savvis group, number one. Secondly, we're finding that virtually all of our enterprise customers now are asking and talking about what is -- wanting to talk about cloud and hosting services. And we believe that bringing those sales groups together, manage those groups together will enhance our ability to bring value to those enterprise and business customers. So that's a major factor there. And that -- we believe that opportunity will grow in the months ahead. Of course, we have a lot of training to do, cross-training to do with our BMG sales folks on cloud and some network training in the Savvis group. But we'll get that done over time. And it also consolidates how we approach the enterprise customers with one contact with coordination here. And we'll have leads and, of course, experts in different types of services. But it makes a lot of sense to us. Secondly, if you look at the businesses we moved to RMG and territory, the large businesses that we -- where we have local presence and we feel like, with our region management system and our general managers, we can bring more personalized -- build better relationships in these cities and markets where we have our local operating [indiscernible] business. So we think it makes a lot of sense and really will drive value for us and for our customers over time.","R. Stewart Ewing","And David, as of the end of 2011, we had $6.2 billion of NOLs, and we would expect to be a full taxpayer probably in 2015. And also on the synergy question, David, we did not include the reorganization synergies as part of the synergy increase we're talking about with Qwest and -- with Qwest transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael McCormack from Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Stewart, can you just address the change in guidance? It looks like the benefit on both the EPS and SGF [ph] was reached in Q1. I'm just trying to get a sense for how we should think about margins as the year progresses. It looks like, again, that the guidance increase was already captured. And then maybe just a quick comment, a little more color on the Qwest upside. You mentioned it was non-personnel. Is that access or other things we should be thinking about?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so Michael, basically the change in the guidance, most of it was captured. We always have a seasonal increase in expenses in the second and third quarters really related to our folks being able to get out and do more maintenance on the network and energy cost increase with heating -- with cooling, rather, in the summer and things like that. So most of it was really captured in the first quarter. With respect to margins, we'd expect the margin, it was a little bit over 42% in the first quarter, would expect to end up somewhere in the 41.5% range or so, probably, for the full year.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And any Qwest comments? You mentioned it was non-personnel. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the moving parts were there on the upside.","R. Stewart Ewing","So basically, in the network side, I think we've basically been able to consolidate, do more from the standpoint of consolidating some of the networks and getting more efficiencies there, getting off of third-party networks. With respect to RMG, I think they were just able to basically reduce some of the expenses associated -- that are really -- they're not headcount-related, but they're related to getting out of some buildings and things like that. And then with respect to the finance group, basically we were able to reduce some of our insurance costs more than we thought and then just some of the other costs, actually building-related costs, too, that were financed -- that were related to their...","Glen F. Post","And some contract labor.","R. Stewart Ewing","And some contract labor. Contract labor reductions as well, both in the finance group and in RMG.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Coleman from RBC Capital Markets.","David G. Coleman - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just on your revenue guidance for 2012, if I take the midpoint of the 2Q and the full year revenue guidance, it suggests a material improvement in the rate of decline in the second half of the year, almost to the point of flat revenues existing -- I'm sorry, exiting 2012. So I was wondering what your revenue trend expectations are for the year and when you would anticipate achieving revenue stabilization. And then just on the broadband side, you continue to post pretty good broadband subscriber numbers. Just wondering what the source of these new subscribers are, if it's new to category or switchers from cable or another broadband provider.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. So basically, on the revenue guidance, I mean, we do expect revenue to continue to improve throughout the year. And the reasons that it will continue to improve is, one, on the RMG side, basically we'll continue to add customers with our Prism TV service. We also expect to add additional broadband customers. And our folks are doing a really good job on the business side as well, attracting new customers and data revenues from our business customers. On the -- and we expect Savvis revenues to continue to grow throughout the year. So we believe that will help revenue growth as well during the year or help improve the reduction that we've been seeing in the past. Yes, we're not ready to call yet that we'll get to revenue stability in the fourth quarter, but, hopefully, we should see some continued improvement throughout the year.","Karen A. Puckett","And on the -- this is Karen Puckett. On the high speed, really there's 3 categories. One, our local model. General managers and the local engagement from the team having quota kind of by market has been extremely helpful in visibility into that. Secondly, I would just say the continuation of the change in the go-to-market. So first off, our Price-Lock, 5-year Price-Lock, as well as our Bundle Your Way [ph], which is something we've had in the market for a couple of quarters now, have continued to play extremely well for us. Our call center continues to perform. Their Sales Per 100 [ph] continues to go up, especially in the legacy Qwest centers that we were attempting to get up to the legacy CenturyLink levels. And then we've initiated quite a few contact kind of retention strategies that has helped us on the churn side. So all 3 of those really gave us a great quarter. Relative to second quarter, I would just be mindful that there is seasonality always in second quarter pretty significantly right around Snowbirds. And so typically, that had been [indiscernible] for us. Now we have Arizona and other areas as well as college students.","Operator","Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","For the BMG unit, I believe that you mentioned some personnel increases that caused some pressure on expenses and on margins in the first quarter. Have you reached the scale that you want now? Can we expect margins for that unit to continue to improve from here? I understand those organizational changes are going to change the overall outlook, but would you -- just for that segment, would you expect margins to improve?","Glen F. Post","Batya, yes. We believe that the -- now we're going to be changing segments next quarter, so it's going to be awfully -- and we're going to have to go back and restate what is BMG segment today because some of their -- all their customers that are in -- for the most part, their customers that are in the legacy local exchange areas are going to be moving over to the RMG group. So we'll have to see what impact that has on margins. But just from the standpoint of where the sales force is, I mean, we think the expense associated with the sales force is where it needs to be at this point and don't really expect any continued expansion there in the BMG.","Operator","And our next question comes from Scott Goldman from Goldman Sachs.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. Maybe, Stewart, just going back to one of the previous questions and talking in reference to the margin trajectory, but help us think through how some of the costs layer in throughout the year. What would be the timing of that? With the Qwest markets, are you still planning on doing 2 Qwest markets throughout the year? And what might be the timing of that and perhaps the timing of some of the other initiatives around hosting and cloud to help us think through that? And then secondly, maybe, Glen, maybe you can help us think about or your latest thoughts on M&A. Clearly, with the synergy guidance hike today, I think that suggests you're more comfortable with the Qwest integration progress. So maybe you could talk a little bit about your appetite for further M&A and what types of assets could be of interest.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so cash expenses, we would expect to be up marginally in the second quarter over the first quarter, again just due to mostly seasonality, and then marginally up again in the third quarter, partially due to seasonality there in the utilities and the expectation that we would be increasing cost associated with the Prism TV service, and also Savvis where we're adding some data center capacity throughout the year. And then, hopefully, costs would flatten out somewhat between third and fourth quarter as those seasonal increases start declining somewhat as the weather cools off.","Glen F. Post","And Scott, regarding the Qwest integration, but it is going well. We're on target there. We successfully completed the SAP conversion. We have selected all the major systems now. We're going to be converting in the months ahead. So it's going well. We have more visibility than we had. So we're feeling good about it. But there still has to be a lot of focus on integration. We have to get it right. So we're not letting up there. Also, we have still Savvis coming in and really the reorganization, a lot of focus there. However, as we see these -- the integration really come to fruition like we expect, we will continue to, first of all, focus on our 4 key initiatives, like we've talked about: the broadband expansion, fiber-to-the-tower, our Prism TV and Managed Hosting and cloud services. That being said, we will continue to look at opportunities for inorganic growth and drive shareholder value but more so the further we move down the road with the Qwest integration. So I'm not ready to tip our hand on what our favorites would be there, but we'll be looking at opportunities that we think can drive long-term shareholder value. And that will be our goal as we look at inorganic opportunities.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, Scott, it's not really a cash flow item, but we would expect depreciation expense to increase marginally each quarter as well as we continue to make investments for growth in the future.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","All right. And just following up on that, Stewart. Is it -- can you help us or remind us how much incremental IPTV costs you'll see on the OpEx side this year?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, I think it's about $70 million over last year, over 2011.","Operator","And our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you talk to us about the Connect America Fund money that you've been offered and what your thoughts are there and when we might see some announcement of how much of that you might be able to put to use? And then maybe a question for Jim. Looking at having all of BMG and the Savvis units together, how differently will you be going to market? And how should we think about your approach in the enterprise space with those combined assets as opposed to maybe the way Qwest and Century were operating before?","Glen F. Post","Yes, Frank, so we were allocated about $90 million of the Connect America Fund. And in very rural areas where we really have the greatest need for support, this amount, on a per-location basis, will not be enough to allow us to really do an economic build-out. So we're still in the process really of evaluating our opportunities with respect to that fund, and we'll make a decision within the 90-day period and talk with the FCC. And Frank, on the enterprise, the new enterprise approach, clearly we'll still keep focus on network because we have a large base to maintain there. But more importantly, and the reason we brought these together is a very small percentage of the Qwest and BMG customer base today are using any level of Savvis hosting services or even competitor hosting services. So the opportunity to go to that customer base and leverage our services is very high. So we'll have a focus on hosting, we'll have a focus on network and we'll bring products and services together. In fact, we'll be announcing some in the next few weeks that combines network capabilities with hosting capabilities and cloud capabilities that we can take to that large Qwest base that we think will afford some significant growth opportunities.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","That's great. One quick follow-up, do you have the Qwest data center assets? I think those are under Savvis now? What are the -- what is the outlook for those assets? Were they underutilized? And should we expect to see any -- when should we expect to see that sort of impact the Savvis numbers?","James E. Ousley","We do have those data centers, and those were relatively high utilization. And so we're in the process of, one, kind of refocusing those. And also, they -- in several cases, they weren't up to the Savvis level of data center quality that we need for true enterprise markets. So we've been upgrading those. That'll probably take until the end of the year. And so we'll hopefully be able to expand that by the end of the year. And one of the reasons we brought it under Savvis was to be able to get it under the Savvis umbrella and then leverage those assets. So I would say in the second half of the year you'll see some growth from those Qwest assets.","Operator","Our next question comes from Armintas Sinkevicius from Morgan Stanley.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You guys engaged in a significant amount of debt refinancing this quarter. What sort of visibility do you have with...","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, we're having trouble hearing you, I'm sorry. Could you speak up? Much better.","Armintas Sinkevicius - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you guys have engaged in a significant amount of debt refinancing this quarter. And just wondering what kind of visibility you have into the rating agencies and how you think about buybacks or dividend increases as we go towards the end of this year and beginning of next.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so basically, we'll have our normal conversation with the rating agencies after today in the next week or 2. And -- but we do plan on really fully executing on the $1.5 billion to $2 billion debt payback that we committed to by the end of the year. And then the board will talk at the end of the year or early next year about what to do with free cash flow in 2013. So we can't really make any commitments there now. It will take the rest of the year really to fulfill the commitment that we have.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","I noticed there was no change to free cash flow guidance despite the upside in Q1. Maybe you could talk about the sort of progression of CapEx and working capital puts and takes over the remainder of the year and how you view that. Are you -- are there anything I'm missing aside from the CapEx? Because even if you keep CapEx flat, with the upside in Q1, you should see higher free cash flow for the year.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so the range of guidance that we've given for CapEx is a couple of hundred million dollars. And we were just -- we really wanted to get further into the year before we adjust free cash flow guidance just to see where we think we're going to end up from a CapEx standpoint. If we end up towards the top of the CapEx guidance or from the mid to the top, then basically we wouldn't be able to raise our guidance on free cash flow. So we wanted to give ourselves another quarter there to let that flush out a little bit.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","So we should think of your CapEx progression as more along the lines of AT&T and Verizon seeing a sequential acceleration versus Frontier who seems like they front loaded more of their CapEx given the warm weather?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. We'll see. It'll really be pretty -- I would imagine pretty steady for the rest of the year. We had -- we probably -- our CapEx was unusually high the first quarter this year, the cash CapEx, because of really a lot of money that we spent and invested at the end of last year and the -- just our payables didn't get paid until after the first of the year. So that's why the cash CapEx number was higher than it normally is in first quarter. And expect it to be pretty flat next quarter.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Any further thoughts on Prism TV CapEx for 2013? I had in my notes that you were going to get back to us with some more color at some point as to sort of success-based CapEx there for next year.","R. Stewart Ewing","I think we need to get through 2012 or further into 2012 and get one of the Qwest markets turn to see if we continue to have the success that we've experienced in the 8 markets that we have today and also get one of the Qwest markets up. And then I think we'll be able to give some guidance on 2013.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen F. Post","Thank you, Sayed. CenturyLink's first quarter financial results and operating metrics reflect a solid start toward achieving our 2012 objectives. We're improving our top line revenue trend, slowing the rate of our line loss and driving product penetration of our broadband services, including Internet and Prism TV and high-bandwidth services. Our integration of the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions are proceeding well and, as a result, we've increased the annual synergy run rate to $650 million. Our operating group restructuring announced in late March became effective April 1, which we expect to drive additional benefits in the integration of Qwest and Savvis. And we believe this enhances our ability to leverage our asset portfolio to serve our business and government customers. We expect to continue to invest in our key strategic initiatives as we believe these investments continue to strengthen CenturyLink's ability to compete on a local, national and a global scale. Finally, I'd like to invite all of you and the investment community to our Analyst Day that we have scheduled for June 12 at the New York Stock Exchange. The invitation and registration information will be sent out this week. We hope you'll be able to attend and meet members of our executive team there. Thank you for being on our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in the months ahead.","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Glen?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results of operations and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015.","Beginning on slide 5, as you know, CenturyLink continues our transition to becoming a leading provider of integrated IP-enabled network hosting and IT services. This transition brings both opportunities and challenges, as we work to find ways to provide our customers the products and services that they need in today's environment. Faster broadband speeds and hosting solutions are at the top of many of our customers' list of needs. We're deploying GPON to consumer and business customers. We're expanding Prism TV availability and providing competitive enhancements to our network, hosting, and cloud services to meet these demands.","In the third quarter, we saw several positive signs that we're making progress in this transition. First, the Consumer segment had a solid quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth of 1.2%. As we continue to deploy GPON and Prism TV to more locations throughout our footprint, we're attracting more high-valued customers. And we have increased our ARPU through the continued launch of GPON, higher value bundle sales, and select pricing increases. Second, the business sales organization realignment implemented earlier this year is now proving effective, as new sales to business customers for the third quarter increased year over year and sequentially. The third quarter marks the second straight quarter of accelerating sales, with particular strength in global and enterprise.","Additionally, in our business sector, we exited third quarter with a strong business sales funnel, including an increased number of large deal opportunities. You will recall last quarter we stated that our operating expenses got ahead of our budgets and that we were committed to addressing that during the last half of the year. We're delivering on that commitment, as we have taken steps to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015. We achieved a portion of this expense reduction relative to plan in the third quarter, but the majority of the benefit will be realized in the fourth quarter of this year.","Also, we are well on track to lower our full-year 2015 planned capital budget by about $200 million, which will result in full-year capital expenditures of about $2.8 billion. We're encouraged by these areas where we're seeing positive momentum. However, the overall revenues for third quarter were below our expectations, primarily due to softness in hosting and long-distance service revenues along with higher credits and other one-time items in the quarter.","If you normalize for the one-time items that total about $20 million to $25 million, operating and core revenues were both at the low end of our quarterly guidance range. Although our third quarter revenue results did not meet our expectations, I'm very confident that we have the assets, the products and the opportunities required to grow our business in the months ahead.","Now turning to slide 6. We believe several key priorities will drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues, driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud, and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network service offerings, we continue to see strong demand from business, wholesale, and government customers for high-bandwidth data services such as Ethernet, MPLS, and business GPON. And we're investing in aligning our business to take advantage of this opportunity.","This quarter, we saw continued strength in our sales momentum. Third quarter 2015 retail network sales were up approximately 15% from second quarter 2015 and up approximately 25% from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, we exited the quarter with a strong business sales funnel. The sales funnel has continued to strengthen during fourth quarter, and October sales results were the highest of the year.","I want to give you a few examples of what we're doing to drive higher sales over time. As of September 30, we had fiber to the prem, including GPON, available to about 490,000 business locations. There is good demand for this product, and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. We also continue to enhance other core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS and SIP trunking services and to add new capabilities to our managed office product suite to provide differentiated simplicity for small to medium business customers looking for fully outsourced network, customer prem equipment, cloud, and business application solutions.","We're also seeing increased interest in our managed network service offerings, that is, customers who look to us not only to provide their connectivity, but also to manage their NDN network environment to include monitoring, security, and CPE. Additionally, we have a major focus on leveraging our cloud capabilities to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private and dedicated environments. Over the last few months, we have refocused on our legacy cloud and managed hosting products as part of our hybrid IT strategy. We recently rolled out an enhancement of our legacy cloud product that seamlessly supports SAP workloads and we have seen strong customer interest in this product.","We're seeing growing interest in managed hosting legacy cloud products, as our managed hosting funnel is up almost 60% since August. This funnel growth is being driven by cross-selling across our customer base, including state government, education and a broad range of Fortune 500 and mid-size companies. Finally, we're also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers who are underserved by the traditional larger systems integrators.","Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, generating only about $50 million in revenue this year, but these service offerings give us a good low-capital intensive opportunity to engage at the CXO level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. This capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions including IT consulting has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion or all communications, data and IT services for those customers.","Now continuing on to slide 7 and turning to the Consumer segment. We continue to see good results in those markets where we have deployed higher broadband speeds and Prism TV services. Specifically in our markets with fiber to the prem, including GPON, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint, ending the quarter more than 780,000 households and 16 markets that are now fiber-to-the-prem capable. We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabits over legacy copper networks. Now, this is in the early stages, but it is showing good promise.","We also expanded our Prism TV service to new and existing markets, adding a total of 360,000 addressable homes in the third quarter. We now have nearly 3 million Prism TV addressable homes, which exceeds our expansion target for the year as we pulled forward some 2016 expansion plans into this year. In addition, we're developing an over-the-top platform and finalizing content agreements to enable a robust and competitive video offering for customers, both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint.","And, finally, we are focusing on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization, that should improve our end-to-end provisioning time and help drive standardization. We continue our focus on improving back office processes and systems in an effort to enhance the customer experience and realize expense efficiencies in running the business.","We mentioned last quarter that we had reduced the provisioning time for one of our major products by approximately 40%. And since that time, we've implementing process and system changes to improve the provisioning time for another major product by 30% to 40%. We'll continue to enhance our efforts in this area as we evolve our back-office systems to a more automated approach in the delivery of CenturyLink's products and services.","In addition, we continue to drive network virtualization through the expansion of our software-defined network, or SDN, product and network function virtualization, NFV, capabilities. These enhancements allow customers to remotely establish and manage key network services, such as virtual firewalls, CDN and virtual wide area network services. Our goal is to enable this capability to 43 data centers and approximately 3.1 million businesses by year end.","We have also laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization. We are continuing to use a cloud-first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and Software-as-a-Service solutions across our internal IT operations that we're selling to our cloud and IT hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and drive other efficiencies for us.","Lastly, we continue to make progress in simplifying our processes and streamlining our workflow. Our network inventory consolidation effort, which we have mentioned before, continues to progress well. Additionally, we have implemented an automated sales tool that increased our seller efficiency with anywhere, anytime access to our back-office systems. This initiative has also provided our real-time tracking of opportunities and associated results.","Continuing on to slide 8, I'd also like to briefly comment on the strategic alternative process for our data centers and colocation business operations that we announced today. CenturyLink's board of directors and management team regularly review the company's strategy and consider a wide range of opportunities regarding our business and operations to create value for shareholders. We believe we have the right strategy in combining our network service offerings with the delivery of managed IT and cloud-based services, and our enterprise customers are responding well to our managed services offerings. We expect colocation services will continue to be a service our customers will look for us for, but we do not necessarily believe we have to own the data center assets to be effective in delivery of those services.","Therefore, we have engaged financial advisers, and we've initiated a process to explore the strategic options for our data center assets and operations, which includes 59 datacenters in the U.S., Asia, and Europe, with more than 185 megawatts of power across 2.6 million square feet of raised floor capacity. The review process will involve a full range of options, including but not limited to a partnership or a joint venture, a sale of all or a portion of the data centers, as well as potentially keeping these assets and operations as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. This announcement continues our strategy of proactive portfolio management to drive focus on strategic businesses where we can achieve profitable growth and deliver attractive shareholder value. The process has just commenced, and we have not set a specific timetable for a decision, but we will be updating you on this process as appropriate in the weeks and months ahead.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart for a discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of fourth quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Beginning on slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our third quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. Operating revenues were $4.55 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.9% increase from third quarter 2014 operating revenues. The increase primarily due to the incremental $158 million revenue impact from the acceptance and recognition of CAF phase II funds in the quarter. Our core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.99 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 2.1% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 0.7% year over year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data, and Prism TV.","In the third quarter, we added approximately 11,300 Prism TV customers. High-speed Internet customers declined about 37,000, partially the result of tightening our credit and collection processes. As a result of these actions, high-speed Internet and Prism TV net subscriber growth was negatively impacted. However, these adjustments had little impact on revenue and should actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016, due to lower churn.","We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.78 billion for the third quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39.1%. Cash expenses were nearly flat year over year, primarily due to lower customer premise equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues, which were partially offset by higher employee benefit expenses, Prism TV, and other costs. Cash expenses declined $23 million from the second quarter 2015, as we took measures to reduce planned expenses in the second half of the year. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest, and capital expenditures, along with other income, was $747 million for the quarter. Our solid cash flows continued to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.70. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 9.8 million shares for an investment of $263 million during the quarter. Under the current program, started in the second quarter of 2014, we have repurchased 27.5 million shares through November 3 and have approximately $133 million remaining under the repurchase program.","Moving to slide 11, and our Business segment. In third quarter, Business segment generated $2.64 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $137 million or 4.9% from the same period a year ago. Third quarter strategic revenues for the segment decreased 2.1% to $1.6 billion from third quarter a year ago, driven by the declines in low-bandwidth data services, wholesale repricing, and one-time items, partially offset by continued strength in high-bandwidth services, such as MPLS, Ethernet, and Wavelength. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.1% from third quarter 2014, due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total Business segment expenses decreased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower CPE cost, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 41.5% declined from 44.1% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenues.","On slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. Our high-bandwidth data services revenue grew $44 million, or 6.7% year over year, compared to third quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. While the growth rate remained solid for high-bandwidth services, it was somewhat dampened by renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large wholesale data customer, as we discussed with you last quarter. High-bandwidth data services revenue for retail network customers, excluding wholesale, grew approximately 8.6% year over year.","Our low-bandwidth data services, including private line, continued to decline in the third quarter. The year-over-year decline of $68 million or 11.8% was primarily due to wholesale customers' continued network grooming efforts and the migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year. We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. Hosting revenues declined $7 million, or 2.1% from the prior year, driven primarily by higher credit reserves, including those related to service outages, and an unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, which were partially offset by higher nonrecurring revenue. In the third quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $32 million, or 17% compared to third quarter 2014, driven by lower CPE sales and maintenance revenues. And, again, these revenues are fairly low margin.","Now, turning to slide 13, Consumer generated $1.15 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $18 million or 1.2% from third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 7.2% year over year to $763 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and higher average revenue per customer through select price increases and higher-value bundles. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined only 4.2% from third quarter 2014, as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $10 million or 1.6% compared to the same period a year ago, due to higher Prism TV costs.","Now turning to slide 14. For fourth quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.4 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.97 billion to $4.02 billion and operating cash flow between $1.72 billion and $1.77 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.62 to $0.67. Our anticipated sequential decrease in fourth quarter operating revenues and operating cash flow compared to third quarter results is primarily driven by the retroactive recognition of CAF-II funds in the third quarter.","That concludes our prepared remarks for the day. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Rollins. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was curious if you'd talk a little bit more about the thought process of pursuing strategic alternatives for the data center business. Firstly, if you dispose of that, would that include the cloud and hosting business, or would it be colocation only?","Second, could you talk to us about how much capital you've put into that business to-date, including the M&A? And then, third, could you give us an EBITDA figure for that business in terms of the portion that you're pursuing these alternatives for? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. First of all, we're not ready to talk about the financials at this point. Obviously, we do disclose the revenue for this business is about $600 million annually today. And the sale of these assets do not include our cloud and hosting operations, strictly the data center operations, the colo business itself. That's what we're selling or looking to sell, looking at alternatives, looking at what the best use of these or management of these assets will be. So that's our view right now. We're just starting this process.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And can you just refresh our memory with how much of the assets that you physically own maybe versus those that you lease from third parties?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, most of the assets are leased from third parties. We own several of the data center properties, but just guessing offhand, probably less than 10 or so. Some of the old Qwest data center assets are primarily the ones that we own. Most of the others are leased.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Last question. As you thought about pursuing strategic alternatives for this part of your business, did you evaluate pursuing strategic alternatives for any other parts of your business? Or is that something that you may consider in the future? And thanks again for answering all those questions.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. We continue to look at all of our assets and look at the opportunities for them. And these are the ones we believe today are the ones we should take a look at. We may look at others in the future. But right now, this is the part of the business that we believe that is not necessarily important for us to own. So this is why we're looking at these assets as far as the strategic alternatives are concerned.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line's open. Please go ahead.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, just a follow-up on that. If this $600 million colo business generates a 35% margin and it were to trade at the multiple at which Windstream recently announced their deal, that'd be about $3 billion. And then if you took about half of that and got back to the midpoint of your leverage range, you'd still have $1.5 billion.","What would be your thought process in terms of priorities for allocating that money? 10% of the equity market cap, it obviously potentially creates a lot of options that'd be interesting to discuss.","Second, if you could just give us, more specifically of the $125 million cost cuts, what was in the third quarter? And obviously then we could do the math on the fourth quarter.","And then the last piece would be, Stewart, just on those slides, on 11 and 12, I think that there's a big debate around a company like a CenturyLink, and in particular CenturyLink, is your revenues are coming down, you've had a tough time figuring out what's going to happen on revenue. We're having a tough time. But even tougher has been trying to line up the margins with these different businesses to try to figure out what's important. If CPE comes down, it's not important, but if legacy voice does, it is. Can you put margins around these different buckets so that we could do the math and figure out as we predict what's happening to revenue decline, what's going to happen to margin decline? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, this is Glen. I'll answer the first question and ask Stewart to address the others. We realize there are a lot of good options for us to use the proceeds from this, if we were to end up selling these assets or leverage them in a way to create cash for the company. But we're not ready to talk about those. They're pretty obvious, some of the options we have. But we believe the opportunity is there and we continue to work with our board over the next few months to decide how to best utilize those proceeds.","Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, so in terms of the cost cuts, basically we did a little bit better than we had expected in the third quarter. But we expect fourth quarter costs to be down in the neighborhood of $100 million, which is the same amount we gave last quarter, between third and fourth. And part of that is seasonal, just related to the seasonality of the business. And the rest of it really relates to CPE and some of the measures that we took to reduce our staff. So, again, probably about another $100 million decline from third quarter sequentially in terms of cash operating expenses.","In terms of the revenue trends and forecasting of the margins, based on our increasing sales funnel and the improving sales trend over the last couple quarters and our improving sales to revenue, or order to cash, we hope to reach \u2013 we expect to reach revenue stability during the last half of 2016, so we believe the pressure we're seeing the last half of this year in hosting and wholesale will carry forward into the first half of 2016, which will make the year-over-year revenue comps during that period somewhat challenging. Again, remember, we had the wholesale renegotiation of a contract, too, with a large customer that will cycle through after second quarter of next year. But, unlike previous years, we don't think that next year we will be dependent on significant revenue growth from new initiatives to hit the revenue target in the second half of next year.","In terms of margins, the margins in the Consumer business have been relatively flat, and we would hope to keep the margins there, relatively flat to slightly down, as we'll still see the cycling through of legacy revenue as we drop legacy revenue and replace it with the more strategic revenues such as our Prism TV product. On the Business side, basically, the margin's there. We'd expect to see some continued deterioration there, due to really the same reasons, associated with the loss of legacy revenue and replacing it with the strategic revenues at a lower margin. But we've also done a good job there of controlling our expenses as well, which will hopefully mitigate some of the margin decline that we would otherwise see.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line's open. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Just following up on some of the questions around the strategic alternatives that you're currently pursuing. Can you provide us with a bit more color in terms of why do you believe this is the opportune time right now to monetize sort of the colocation services business? I would suspect that given the demand environment, there is healthy demand for those types of services. So would love to hear sort of your thought process on why this is the opportune time.","And I recognize that thinking about sort of specifics around what you could do with that capital building, upon David's prior question, is probably a bit early stage right now, but as you look at your portfolio of assets today, how do you feel about the portfolio assets in terms of the growth opportunities? Because clearly, within the portfolio, there are some key growth opportunities. And how we should think about whether or not there's a potential opportunity to bolt on additional assets or anything along those lines in order to accelerate growth toward your strategic services. Thank you very much.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Amir, first of all, as you mentioned as far as why now is an opportune time. Valuations are obviously good right now. They can always change, but we know the market's good. But that's just one factor. For us to really grow the business, the colo business, it requires really more CapEx than we've been willing to put in the business. We said that up-front, that we weren't going to invest heavily in the data centers, that we felt they were a synergistic asset that we could grow with the rest of our business.","However, with the valuations, with the \u2013 we think our cash flow maybe could be used for investments that can drive higher returns, basically, and drive better shareholder value. So that's why we're looking at it. And we don't think it's \u2013 as I mentioned earlier \u2013 that it's crucial for us to own these assets in order to provide a full solution package for our customers. So that's why we're looking at it now.","And as far as the asset portfolio, we believe we have a strong portfolio of assets. We can leverage to drive future growth. We don't feel like we are compelled to go out and acquire additional assets or companies. However, we do believe there are some potential acquisitions, inorganic opportunities there that could drive growth. Whatever we do, we'll continue to utilize our very disciplined approach to acquisitions and be sure that we believe they're \u2013 investments can really drive long-term shareholder value. So they're fiber assets, assets that could perhaps drive top line growth that would be synergistic to our other offerings, such as our managed cloud offerings, our other network services that we believe we can grow in the months ahead. So those are the types of opportunities for acquiring assets we'd be looking at.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, and one follow-up, if I may. In terms of your operations, you folks had transitioned a bit of your strategy with respect to your sales force in recent quarters. Would love to get an update in terms of how that transition has occurred and in terms of the progress that you've made from that perspective.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it was a pretty bumpy pride. We said up front it was not going to be \u2013 we were going to have some issues with that. It lasted a little longer than we thought. However, if you look at our sales results this last quarter especially, the latter part of the second quarter and going into third quarter and especially into fourth quarter, we're seeing the benefits of those changes really come to fruition. So we believe it is \u2013 we're proving that it was the right move. And we're hoping \u2013 there are some adjustments we'll make to really fine tune it, but we believe these were positive changes that we're going to see benefit from in the months and years ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line's open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot. You touched on the revenue growth outlook. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment with cable? The broadband market was a little bit soft, or broadband adds were a little bit soft. What's going on there \u2013 churn, gross adds? What can you do to return to growth there? And also on the \u2013 maybe talk a little bit about Prism. We were talking earlier today on one of the calls about cord cutting by the Millennials and the move to over the top, skinny bundles, et cetera. Any thoughts on some of those offerings? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to ask Ross Garrity to talk about that for a minute with you guys.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Ross D. Garrity - Senior Vice President-IT Solutions","Yeah, just in the \u2013 hi, it's nice to meet you. In the Consumer market, the competitive environment has remained fairly stable, but we're seeing another round of speed increases coming from sort of cable providers, from the cable providers. But we continue to see success in areas where we've got greater speeds, and we remain challenged in areas without the higher speeds. We are still continuing to see strong penetration velocity, especially in our GPON markets.","In our small to medium business over the last three quarters, we've seen our investments increase distribution and business GPON in advanced capabilities such as our managed office significantly improved our market share trends versus the cable providers. And we expect to see improving sales and market share trends in the segment, certainly going into 2016. So I think the outlook is fairly positive.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Simon, I might add that the change that we made in the credit policies and, really, collections drove probably about 17,000 or so of the 37,000 decline we saw in high-speed Internet customers during the quarter. We are going to focus on really trying to penetrate the areas where we have rolled out GPON. We're also looking at other ways to improve our speeds \u2013 continually improve our speeds over copper.","So I think that we'll be able to remain competitive and hopefully become more competitive, actually, than we are today. We're also working on an over-the-top offering that we'll be trialing in the third quarter that we hope to roll out on a trial basis in two or three markets, latter part of this year and early next year, that we think will help us with the Millennials and be a lower-cost option from the standpoint of the way we roll it out than our Prism product is today.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Can you address the slowdown in high-speed retail business revenues that we saw? I think it grew 8.6% versus a trend of double-digit growth. And what are you doing to accelerate that growth again?","And second question on the CapEx. You pulled forward some of the spending into third quarter and you maintained the guide for the year. How should we think about potentially different CapEx buckets for next year?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Batya, the slowdown in high-speed internet revenues, we actually had some pretty large federal items that flowed through in the first quarter and the second quarter that didn't reoccur in the third quarter. So I think that's part of that. But part of what we're doing there, too, on high-speed internet and Ethernet really is really pushing to reduce our provisioning periods, like Glen spoke about earlier during his part. In terms of CapEx for 2016, we're currently thinking about $3 billion, which will probably include $350 million to $400 million of CapEx associated with the rollout of the CAF-II.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","And just to follow up, this is for 2016?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","2016, yes. CapEx.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about what's some other things it might take to get the strategic growth back up? And any kind of contracts or other things you can give to suggest that this has kind of changed? And then can you walk us through how you're going to be deploying the CAF-II funds, when we'll start to see the construction for that? And when do you expect to see revenue? And any chance that those deployments might also include video? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Frank, I have a few comments and let Stewart add in for strategic growth back up. If you look at the second half sales growth and funnel expansion, it is creating some improving trends headed into 2016, so we think that's a sign. If you look at our sales, just the sales I mentioned earlier in the funnel, we think that's really a positive.","We're seeing improvement in the front line sales productivity on the Business side. We're seeing higher participation rates or folks hitting our quotas basically. We're seeing growth in our channel partners and alliances there. We expect further growth there in the months ahead. We're also expanding our wholesale product to include HSI and VoIP, Voice over IP. So we expect to enhance our wholesale sales there and revenue.","And then finally, just the continued expansion of GPON and Prism. We've increased our GPON market significantly this year, up to 780,000 households passed. And just that expansion there, along with the business GPON up to about 490,000 businesses now, those give us a lot of potential going forward.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And on the CAF-II deployment?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Frank, with respect to the CAF-II deployment, we would expect to really hit the ground running here in late 2015 to 2016, to get some of the construction done and get the living units that are easiest to get to first such that by the end of 2016 we hope to be upwards of 20% or maybe even a little more in terms of the 1.2 million living units passed.","And with the over-the-top product that we're going to roll out, it would be available to CAF-II households where we have 10 down and one up. And some of those households will have more bandwidth than that, too, if they're closer to the node. So, yes, the product would be available there, so would have a video product available.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Any color on the over-the-top product? Is it just a smaller feature set, or is it a streaming package like Sling? Or what are you thinking about?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Why don't we ask Aamir Hussain to address that for you?","Aamir Hussain - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, we are actually looking at two different type of products. One is a skinny bundle with local, linear and premium. And it will have upsell opportunity for a kid's package, entertainment package and we are looking at multiple options there.","The second product that we are looking to do is in our franchise markets where we have Prism rights, just taking the same content and offering it on an over-the-top content along with an aggregation of other video services which are used by our customers today.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment. I know, Glen, you were talking about the consumer credit on the broadband side driving some share loss. I would have thought, I guess, that broadband was nondiscretionary. I guess you don't have a sense for where those folks are going. But can you just explain how much more runway we have on that consumer credit tightening piece?","And then second part, thinking about the Consumer high-speed internet revenues, do you have any sense or you can break down for us between the fiber-to-the-node served homes versus copper-based DSL? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. Firstly, on the consumer credit, a lot of folks are just switching back and forth carriers. A lot of that's taking place there. And a lot of nonpaid \u2013 we just tightened up on those folks who were not paying, basically, and just switching back and forth. So we think we're through \u2013 we know we're through the majority of that, but there could be \u2013 we'll continue to see the impact of this going forward, but the majority of what caused the initial hit, I think we're through most of that.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the breakdown between fiber to the node and non-fiber to the node, we really don't break that out. But I can tell you, Mike, that our best penetration really in the market's where we have the higher speeds. And that's why we're focused on investing more in access in 2016 to provide higher speeds for our customers such that it will give us a better opportunity to gain them as a customer.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Moorman from D. A. Davidson. Your line's open. Please go ahead.","James G. Moorman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, thanks. Could you just give us kind of your thoughts on the expectations for a bonus depreciation? Has anything changed in terms of you outlook for cash taxes for next year?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so really the outlook for cash taxes is the same as it was last quarter. Basically, our most current information is that we really believe bonus depreciation is squarely in the radar of congressional leaders. The House Ways and Means Committee cleared legislation making 50% bonus depreciation part of the permanent tax code, and the Senate Finance Committee included a two-year extension of 50% bonus retroactive 2015 and 2016 with their extenders package. So we believe the extenders package is going to move along, and we really think that the Senate staff has been really outspoken to our people in terms of getting bonus depreciation this year. So we feel more comfortable that we'll have bonus depreciation in 2015 and 2016 than we did last quarter. And we felt pretty good about it then.","James G. Moorman - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Saber from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Saber - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Related to the data center strategic review, I just wanted to ask around your leverage target, which has been three times for some time. Would this potentially change that target? And the only reason I ask is that if you were to receive a large amount of cash, you have very little prepayable debt. So I just wanted to ask around the leverage target in general. Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, David, that's one of the things we'll have to work through as we get further into the process, but our target is really still about three times. We have said we'll allow that to drift up, just if EBITDA deteriorates and we see EBITDA turning around, out to ultimately bring the leverage back down. So we wouldn't really be held by a rating, more or less, in terms of keeping our EBITDA within a ratings range, but we'll just determine once we get closer to the execution of the opportunity of the data centers as to where we might go with the proceeds there.","David Saber - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for closing remarks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Sayed. Overall, I'll just say I believe we have the best portfolio of assets we've ever had at the company. Now it's really about execution. We're taking these assets, leveraging and positioning them to drive future revenue growth, EBITDA growth and shareholder value. While there will be quarterly ups and downs, CenturyLink's long-term trajectory, in my view, is as positive as it's ever been. So look forward to working with you all in the months ahead.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, released earlier this afternoon. Before we begin, let me apologize for the delay in the start of the call today. However, we had a pretty severe ice storm move through the area in the last 24 hours, closing a number of bridges, overpasses, and roadways.","As a result, we\u2019re normally all in the room together doing this call from one location, but we are not today. So bear with us as the handoffs may not be quite as crisp as they normally are. And thank you for your patients as we get started today.","The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","On slide two, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for first quarter 2014, full year 2014, and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us and our forward-looking statements.","You\u2019ll also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at www.centurylink.com.","Now turning to slide three, your host on today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer; and also available during the question-and-answer period of today's call will be Karen Puckett, CenturyLink's Chief Operating Officer; Bill Cheek, President of our Wholesale Operations, and Jeff Von Deylen, President of CenturyLink Technology Solutions, formerly known as Savvis.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through February 19, 2014, and the webcast replay through March 5, 2014. Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of February 12, 2014 and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","As we move to slide four, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to your host today, Glen Post. Glen? ","","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I\u2019m one of the ones who is iced in. Working from my home, so we\u2019ll try to make this as smooth as we can, Stewart and Karen and Jeff. ","If you will turn to slide five, I\u2019d like to start off by recapping our performance for 2013. During the year, we continued to effectively execute our objectives and make investments that we believe will lead to revenue stability. For the full year 2013, total revenue declined by 1.5% compared to 2012. ","In 2013, our core revenues trend continued to improve from a 2.3% annual decline in 2012 to 1.3% annual decline in 2013. This continued revenue improvement was driven by a nearly $400 million increase in strategic revenues, primarily due to growth in broadband, Prism TV, and high bandwidth data services and hosting services.","The annual strategic revenue growth was driven in part by a 13.4% growth in MPLS, Ethernet , and Wavelength revenues. Additionally, the decline of legacy revenues has slowed from 8.4% in 2012 to 7.3% in 2013. ","We achieved solid growth in both high speed internet and Prism TV subscribers throughout the year, adding 140,00 HSI customers and 69,000 Prism TV subscribers. We\u2019ve been pleased with the early growth of Prism TV subscribers in new legacy Qwest markets where we lost Prism in 2013. ","Throughout the year, we invested to improve broadband speed availability across our footprint. We grew the number of enabled access lines receiving 20 Mbps and 40 Mbps each by approximately 25% over the prior year.","Also, we continue to focus on deploying more fiber to multitenant buildings and expanded the program by approximately 1,000 buildings during the year. We have continued to make excellent progress on our $2 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board in mid-February of last year.","During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 10.5 million shares for a total investment of $331 million. From the inception of the program in February 2013 through February 11, 2014, we have completed 86% of the $2 billion program, having purchased a total of 50.8 million shares or $1.72 billion. We currently expect to complete the remainder of the current $2 billion stock repurchase program during the second quarter of 2014, well ahead of the original two-year timeframe. ","Based on this anticipated early completion of our current stock repurchase program, the current level of our stock price, and the strong free cash flow we believe we will generate during 2014, management expects to recommend to our board that they approve a follow-on stock repurchase authorization at our regularly scheduled meeting later this month. This of course would position us to continue to opportunistically repurchase shares and return additional free cash to shareholders once our current stock repurchase plan is completed. ","Over the last few weeks, our investor relations team has heard from the investment community that some investors are stating CenturyLink\u2019s dividend is not sustainable. Obviously, that concerns us, so I want to clearly address the sustainability of our dividend before making further comments.","We remain confident that the investment in our key strategic initiatives continues to position us to reach revenue stability in 2015 and establish a revenue growth trend soon thereafter. Our strong fourth quarter and solid full year 2013 results, along with our full year 2014 revenue guidance show that we have made, and that we anticipate continuing to make, progress toward reaching our revenue objectives.","Additionally, we expect to successfully align our operating cost with our future revenue streams to continue to generate solid, predictable cash flows in the years ahead. We believe in our growth opportunities, and we also know that we must improve our operational efficiency to mitigate the impact of the revenue mix shift on our operational cash flow and free cash flow over time.","We believe this improving revenue trend, along with the strategic opportunities in the marketplace, position us well for future revenue growth and cash generation. These are the key reasons we believe that our dividend is sustainable and that our payout ratio will remain at a reasonable level, even as we begin to pay higher cash taxes in the future.","If you\u2019ll turn to slide six, I\u2019ll provide an update on our key strategic initiatives. Throughout the year, we have diligently executed in the four key strategic initiatives we initially laid out in third quarter 2011. We believe our investment in these strategies will continue to strengthen our overall product portfolio, which further positions CenturyLink as a leading integrated provider of global network, data hosting, and cloud solutions. ","Starting with broadband expansion and enhancement, we continue to make significant investments in this area that we believe will better serve our business and consumer customers. We ended the quarter with approximately 6 million broadband customers. We had a strong fourth quarter, adding nearly 49,000 new subscribers, and we believe our fiber assets, including approximately 240,000 fiber miles across the U.S., position us well in the business market.","We continue to grow our advanced multitenant unit, or MTU, program. We had 200 fiber-fed buildings in the quarter, increasing the number of fiber-fed buildings by 17% in the third quarter. This program offers broadband capabilities of up to 1 gigabit of symmetrical service and it enhances cloud connectivity for these business customers.","We have made very good progress over the past few years in cost effectively deploying broadband services. We have enabled a total of nearly 8 million homes with fiber to node, and have passed a total of approximately 2 million homes with Prism TV capabilities.","We have utilized and continue to utilized a balanced capital investment approach, including gigabit fiber, VDSL2, and pair bonding deployments to efficiently enable higher speeds and enhance services to consumers and businesses in our markets. This balanced investment strategy has allowed us to deliver very competitive broadband speeds, including up to 1 gigabit service in a number of areas in an efficient manner, and to continue to drive broadband penetration.","Early results from our 1 gigabit pilots in Omaha and Las Vegas have met or exceeded our expectations, and are good indicators that by coupling GPON technology, gigabit enablement with expansion of fiber to the node, and Prism TV deployment, we can successfully compete and meet the broadband needs of both consumer and business customers. ","Our announcement last week regarding the delivery of up to 1 gigabit service to more than 2,500 Salt Lake City businesses located in multitenant unit office buildings, or MTUs, is an example of how we\u2019re leveraging our existing fiber to opportunistically expand speed and service capability to high value business and consumer customers.","Both the MTU and GPON programs offer upstream speeds and business service level agreements beyond what is normally available with the cable companies. These offerings are particularly compelling in the business market, where upstream capabilities are critical to enablement of cloud services.","In business areas where we do not offer our advanced MTU or GPON programs, we have extensively deployed Ethernet services. We currently cover over 2.3 million business locations with even that capability, with nearly half of this footprint capable of 20 megabits and higher symmetrical speeds.","In the months ahead, we expect to continue making the investments in our network enhanced speed capabilities required to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets.","Turning to slide seven, Prism TV service continues to perform well, and represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable TV service in the markets where we offer the service, and we added a record 26,000 Prism TV subscribers during the fourth quarter, ending with a total of 175,000 subscribers in service.","Over 50% of these added customers are new to CenturyLink, and they continue to have a very high rate of broadband attachment. This quarter we experienced an attachment rate of 98%. We continue to expand the footprint where Prism service is available, and in fourth quarter we added approximately 180,000 addressable homes of which just over half are in the newly launched markets of Phoenix, Colorado Springs, Omaha, and Denver. We are very pleased with the early Prism subscriber growth in these first Qwest markets to provide this video service. ","We continue to see our churn rates improve with Prism Triple Play bundled customers, where the bundled customers are less likely to churn than the single play [unintelligible] customers. In addition, we continue to enhance our IPTV features by introducing new functionality and applications including expansion of our TV Everywhere capabilities, video-on-demand library, and our recent successful trial of wireless set top boxes.","Continuing on to slide eight, during the fourth quarter we completed approximately 930 fiber to tower builds for a total of 4,100 fiber builds in 2013, and over 18,800 total fiber connected towers across our footprint. In 2014, we expect to complete a total of 3,000 to 3,500 fiber builds.","As expected, we continue to experience some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition from copper based DS1 facilities to fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we anticipate that wireless data bandwidth growth will result in expansion of Ethernet consumption and thereby reverse the current revenue compression during 2014.","Moving to slide nine, managed hosting and cloud services, we continue to believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long term growth opportunities in this space will be developed and we\u2019re expanding our strong product offerings. Cross sell or team selling opportunities for hosting products across our hosting and network sales teams continue to be strong, with sales of hosting services to business customers steadily growing.","Sales of hosting services to the network business customer base has grown significantly in the fourth quarter. We expect to maintain this momentum as customers seek IT solutions to streamline their operations, increase efficiency, and reduce cost. We are focused on growing hosting sales to our large base of business network customers, and expanding our hosting demand generation across target customer segments.","While we expect to have some churn of larger colocation clients, we expect the new initiatives to continue to drive growth. We continue to invest to increase our data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. In the fourth quarter, we opened a new data center in Hong Kong, and we announced late in November the acquisition of Tier 3, an innovative provider of public cloud services. ","Tier 3\u2019s products, roadmap, and vision are now the foundation of CenturyLink\u2019s cloud development strategy. We believe Tier 3\u2019s public multitenant cloud platform, combined with our global network and data center footprint and managed services team will greatly enhance our service capabilities to businesses of all sizes.","Additionally, in January this year Savvis began operating as CenturyLink Technology Solutions, aligning the brand with CenturyLink and demonstrating deeper ties to the broadband portfolio of IT solutions delivered to businesses.","Turning to slide 10, I\u2019d like to shift briefly from 2013 achievement to looking ahead at our priorities for 2014. We were pleased with the strong consumer metrics generated in 2013, as we achieved high speed internet and Prism TV subscriber growth. As we enter 2014, we expect to continue to invest to enable higher broadband speeds and drive further broadband penetration across our markets.","During 2013, we enabled Prism TV service to approximately 800,000 incremental households, primarily driven by our launch of Phoenix, Colorado Springs, and Omaha during the year. We expect to continue to expand our Prism TV addressable market during 2014 and to drive subscriber growth during the year, driven by the expanded and addressable market, improvements in our programming packages, and the continued improvement in the customer experience. ","We also will continue to monitor our success in all of our Prism TV markets, including Highlands Ranch, Colorado, a suburb of Denver. We launched service late last year and may consider further expansion of our Prism markets if our results continue to be strong.","With our customer retention programs, we continue to refine a series of programs targeting our highest-value customers, focused on high speed internet, voice, and Prism TV services. We also extended programs focused on new customer outreach, auto-pay take rates, and overall higher quality sales during the year. ","In our business segment, we will continue to focus on driving growth in sales of high-bandwidth data services including MPLS, Ethernet, and Wavelength to meet strong customer demand. We believe our targeted marketing approach and sales programs, as well as continued enhancements in our product portfolio, continue to position us to drive revenue growth.","Based on early sales results associated with our recent launch of Managed Office, we will continue to grow and expand these by the seat solutions to meet market demand and gain market share. We also expect to continue to expand our GPON and fiber deployment to buildings, providing expanded addressable market opportunities to our business sales team.","In our wholesale segment, we continue to expand our fiber deployment to wireless towers, continue to drive revenue growth from the continued market demand, and from wireless carriers for wireless data backhaul. However, we expect our 2014 expansion pace to be below that of the last few years.","Utilizing the capabilities of CenturyLink technology solutions and the recent acquisition of Tier 3, we also expect to expand our marketing of white label cloud services on a wholesale basis, enabling us to drive further growth in cloud services in the coming year. ","In the data hosting segment, we will migrate it to a single platform, that of Tier 3, for all cloud and managed services, which will enable new capabilities that further differentiate CenturyLink in the market and enhance customer experience. ","Further, we will meet customer needs by selling a full portfolio of colocation, cloud, and managed hosting services, while retaining existing customers through exceptional service. Lastly, we expect to identify key partners that will help expand our capabilities beyond our direct sales force and drive additional revenues there as well. ","Overall, I\u2019m pleased with the solid results for the quarter and the full year. We continue to invest to drive growth, and we\u2019re experiencing good traction in those key areas. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and guidance.","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","Thank you, Glen. I\u2019ll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the first quarter and full year 2014 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon. ","Beginning on slide 12, I\u2019d like to review some highlights from our strong fourth quarter results. I\u2019ll be reviewing the results excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules.","As you can see, we generated solid operating revenues and cash flows in the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.54 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.9% decline from fourth quarter a year ago. Core revenues, defined as strategic revenues plus our legacy revenues, were $4.11 billion for fourth quarter, a decline of 0.4% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 5.4% year over year, and represent 50% of our total revenues compared to 47% a year ago. ","Strength in strategic products such as high speed internet, high bandwidth data services, Prism TV, and managed hosting services continues to drive this growth. As Glen mentioned earlier, subscriber growth was strong for both broadband and Prism TV.","From a business market perspective, we experienced strong new sales to business customers for network and hosting services in the fourth quarter. We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.84 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40.4%.","As we\u2019ve discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.68, well ahead of the midpoint of our guidance of $0.58. Results included the benefit of certain favorable year-end operating expense adjustments related to employee benefits, operating and income taxes. ","Normalizing for these items, operating expenses would be approximately $60 million higher and adjusted diluted earnings per share would be $0.59 above the midpoint of our guidance range for both operating cash flow and adjusted diluted EPS. Additionally, we generated $601 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest, and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income.","Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long term shareholder value. Also during the quarter, we made strong progress on the share repurchase program, buying 10.5 million shares for $331 million.","Now, turning to slide 13, the 0.9% decline in fourth quarter 2013 operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2012 was primarily a result of growth in strategic revenues that was more than offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high speed internet, high bandwidth business data services, Prism TV, and data hosting services.","Now, turning to slide 14, we\u2019ll discuss each of our operating segments, beginning first with the consumer segment. Consumer generated nearly $1.5 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 1.7% over fourth quarter a year ago. Our strategic revenues in this segment grew 7.7% year over year, to $683 million, driven by growth in high speed internet and Prism subscribers and the full quarter impact of price increases.","The long term growth rate in high speed internet is likely to slow over time, due to our growth in penetration of households. Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 8.4% from fourth quarter 2012, due primarily to a continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues. Expenses were essentially flat compared to the same period a year ago, driven mainly by lower employee related costs, which were partially offset by higher Prism TV cost.","Moving to slide 15, our business segment generated $1.56 billion in operating revenues during the fourth quarter, which increased $16 million or 1% from the same period a year ago. On a sequential basis, total revenues grew $19 million from third quarter 2013, primarily driven by higher CPE revenue.","Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased by 7.5% to $643 million from fourth quarter 2012, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet, and Wavelength. We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer segments, and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium sized business space to improve market share and drive further growth.","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined 3.5% from fourth quarter a year ago, due primarily to a continuing decline in access line and long distance revenues. Total segment expenses increased $39 million or 4.1%, driven by higher facility costs associated with our MPLS product growth.","Now, turning to slide 16, our wholesale segment generated $884 million in operating revenues, a decline of 2.5% from fourth quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $581 million, which grew 1.6% from fourth quarter 2012 as growth in Ethernet services and data bandwidth capacity expansion by wireless carriers and delays in TDM disconnects offset the decline in low speed transport services revenue. ","Legacy revenues declined by 9.6% to $303 million, reflecting the continued decline in access and long distance minutes of use and the implementation of lower access rates under the CAF Order rate step-down. ","Operating expenses for the quarter were $290 million, 3.7% below the same period in prior year, driven primarily by lower voice usage costs. Now, moving to slide 17, and our data hosting segment, which includes all colocation, managed hosting, cloud, and hosting related network services revenues.","This segment generated $353 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 3.8% from fourth quarter 2012 revenues of $340 million. Year over year managed hosting revenues including cloud grew 14%. Colocation growth of 1.4% was weakened by customer churn and price erosion in previous quarters.","Data hosting and operating expenses were $283 million in fourth quarter, compared to $264 million in fourth quarter 2012. This 7.2% increase is primarily due to increased sales costs, the Tier 3 and [unintelligible] acquisitions and incremental expenses associated with them, and investments in marketing.","Over time, we expect long term improvement in both revenue and margin trends across the data hosting segment and continue to leverage these assets to drive additional revenue through cross selling opportunities in our other segments. ","On slide 18, we provide our first quarter 2014 guidance. We expect for the first quarter 2014, operating revenues and operating cash flow to decrease compared to fourth quarter 2013, primarily due to a decline in legacy and data integration revenues along with favorable employee benefits and operating tax true-ups present in fourth quarter 2013 results that are not expected to reoccur in first quarter 2014.","Similar to last year, we also anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven primarily by the impact of declining amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and the annual review and update of depreciation rates.","For first quarter 2014, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.46 billion to $4.51 billion, our core revenues of $4.07 to $4.12 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.73 billion and $1.78 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.63.","On slide 19, we provide our full year 2014 guidance. For the full year 2014, we expect total operating revenues of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion, reflecting a year over year revenue change of flat to negative 1.2% and core revenues of $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion.","Operating cash flow is expected to be between $7.05 billion and $7.25 billion, and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be between $2.40 to $2.60. Our capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3 billion as we continue to make investments in key growth areas. So we anticipate free cash flow for full year 2014 to be between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion.","We anticipate decline in operating cash flow and free cash flow, primarily driven by the decline in legacy revenue, investments to continue to grow strategic revenues, as well as a lower level of acquisition related synergies in 2014 compared to the level of incremental synergies that we achieved in 2013. ","That concludes our prepared remarks for the day, so at this time I\u2019ll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Your final question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","I want to talk first a little bit about the guidance, Stewart, if I could. So first, the full year midpoint is looking for a margin of around 39.7%, which is a higher margin than you had in the fourth quarter, a higher margin than you\u2019re guiding to in the first quarter. So if you could kind of step us through where that margin expansion and where the pivot starts to occur, that would be helpful.","I think the second thing that would be helpful is, you know, last year, around the middle of the year, there were challenges to the guidance numbers and hitting those numbers. Can you talk a little about the process that you went through for setting these expectations here now, and kind of some of the base case expectations that you made around the enterprise environment and other things?","And then lastly, if I could, you talk about, as we all know, the falling revenues in legacy have higher margins than the growing revenues in kind of strategic services do. You\u2019ve also talked about the potential for a pivot in EBITDA about a year following the pivot in revenue growth. Could you put numbers around those margin numbers? If you were having a conversation with someone, and they say legacy revenues are X and strategic revenues are Y, at what margins could we have a conversation about that? And think about when the EBITDA pivot can occur.","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","First of all, the full year guidance midpoint basically is 39.7%. The midpoint in the first quarter is 39.1%. So obviously we expect the latter three quarters of the year to be above that. We basically have expense reduction programs that we\u2019re working to put in place, which will help reduce our expenses from the first quarter expected levels into second, third, and fourth quarter of the year.","Our guidance last year in 2013, if you\u2019ll recall, we had a hockey stick, basically, in revenues. So where we really missed our guidance in \u201913 and came back and tweaked it some was really associated with the revenue that we hope to get out of some of the products such as Savvis Direct, which is our cloud product, and another product that just didn\u2019t materialize as we had hoped.","We feel like we have all that worked through in 2014, and feel much more comfortable with the revenue guidance in 2014, I think, looking back on the experience we had last year. So we feel much better about the guidance there. And again, on the expense side, we think we have the programs in place and about to put in place to get us to the point where we need to be to hit the guidance.","In terms of EBITDA pivot, basically we will continue to lose legacy revenues, but our strategic revenues grew very strong in the fourth quarter, and really full \u201913. We expect continued growth in strategic revenues in 2014. What we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019re not ready really to put a peg in when we can stabilize the EBITDA, and turn to EBITDA growth, but as Glen indicated in his prepared remarks, we do expect to get to revenue stability in 2015. ","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","And Stewart, just to be clear, I think you have kind of talked about a 12-month lag between the revenue pivot and EBITDA stability. Are you saying something different now? Or am I missing it?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","Really pretty much the same. What we\u2019ve said exactly, I think, is hopefully we would get to EBITDA stability shortly thereafter, or sometime reasonably thereafter. You know, a year or so. We\u2019re not really saying anything different than we said before.","Operator","And our next question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick - JPMorgan ","Can you talk about a couple of things? One is the 4Q employee cost savings, just help us out and help us understand what was there, and I understand it\u2019s not going to be there in the first quarter. And then as you think about the buyback from here, what\u2019s management thinking about in terms of the size of that recommendation? And how should we think about the max leverage on the business going forward?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","From a leverage standpoint, we said that we would like to stay in the 3x debt to EBITDA or so. We\u2019re at 2.8x debt to EBITDA now. I\u2019ll let Glen talk to the buyback for a moment, and then I\u2019ll come back to the cost savings.","Glen F. Post III ","You know, besides the buyback, we\u2019ve really not discussed that with the board yet, so I\u2019m not ready to put a number out there, but we realize it has to be significant enough to make a difference and give us an opportunity really to buy our stock back at attractive prices, which obviously we believe the current price is very attractive. But we\u2019re not ready to give a number yet. We\u2019ll announce that after the board meets.","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","And the employee cost savings were really related to employee benefits, and it was really just making adjustments for really all the adjustments related to the full year 2013. They revolved around our medical, dental, and vision accruals, basically, for current year cost. ","They also revolved around some of our post-retirement benefit costs as we made adjustments to adjust that to the liability that it needed to be at. We changed our paid time off policy and had fewer hours carried over from year to year. A lot of people took a lot of time off, both the last quarter of the year, so that drove our paid time off expense up. ","That\u2019s about $40 million of that. The remainder of the other $20 million or so is really related to a transaction tax reserve that we had on an acquired company that is no longer necessary, so we\u2019re able to limit that reserve as well as our normal year-end ad valorem tax true ups for the most part. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. ","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Maybe just a quick comment, Stewart, regarding the view here. Obviously you\u2019re discussing the potential for share repurchase. The competitive landscape for high speed, obviously, becomes tougher and tougher, I think, as cable gets more aggressive on pricing or functionality. What\u2019s your thought regarding balance in the capital budget, when you look at 2014 versus thinking about a repo? And then if you can give us any color on what you\u2019re thinking for cash taxes rolling into the \u201914 guide, that would be great. ","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","Let me hit the last point first, and I\u2019ll let Karen talk a little bit about competition. Cash tax is somewhere between $50 million and $100 million in 2014. The potential for share repurchase and balancing that with the capital budget, we think our capital budget will be about $3 billion this year, and we think that that will give us enough free cash flow to complete the share repurchase program that we have in place, which we have about $300 million remaining there, and implement another program that we would expect to get the board to approve at our February meeting in a couple of weeks. ","Karen, you want to talk about where we are with regard to high speed internet?","Karen Puckett","Yeah, in terms of high speed internet, just great quarter, and congratulations to the CenturyLink whole team that made that happen. But I would say that we have ADSL2 fiber to the node capabilities, and we really do a great job with our local model using the capital and optimizing by market what capability, and how we can market the best capable speed with the cash available.","So it really is a balance of the cash, the technology capability on the economics, and then taking that and optimizing that message within each market. So it is very market specific. And we seem to win that way.","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","And we consistently upgrade speeds. I think in the talking points that we have, I think there\u2019s a 25% increase in the households that could receive a 20 megabits and higher and a 25% increase in the households that could get 40 megabits or higher at the end of \u201913 versus the end of \u201912. And we\u2019ll continue to shorten the loop, to put fiber in the network to shorten loops to bond, and just to do whatever\u2019s necessary in our markets to be able to compete with the cable companies. ","Mike McCormack - Jefferies ","And Stewart, when you look at 2014, does the available homes for sale for Prism, is that going to be expanding at the same rate we saw in \u201913?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","It will not expand at the same rate. We added about 800,000 homes past in 2013. For 2014, we have the Phoenix market to complete, and we have, I think Glen mentioned, the area in Colorado, Highlands Ranch. And we\u2019ll have incremental expansion in really most of the markets. We\u2019ll cover potentially at least an additional 300,000, maybe 400,000 homes in 2014, really without going into any new markets. And we\u2019ll evaluate new markets through the early part of the year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ","Glen, you talked in your prepared remarks about the strategic opportunities in the marketplace. I wonder if you could just expand on that a little bit. Does that mean doing more things like Tier 3? And then just a clarification, Stewart. I think I\u2019m right in saying that your Q1 and your \u201914 guidance only includes the share count as of December 31, that the buybacks you\u2019ve done year to date are not in that number? Just want to clarify that number. So, given what you\u2019ve already completed in the last six weeks or so, that will help some of the earnings versus what you\u2019ve printed here, is that right?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","Yes, Simon, that\u2019s correct. Our guidance only includes this year\u2019s purchases through the end of the year.","Glen F. Post III ","Regarding my comments about strategic opportunities, I really wasn\u2019t talking about a potential acquisition. I was talking more about the opportunity to expand our services, especially in the cloud hosting space, IT services space, where we\u2019re seeing more and more demand in that space, with our Tier 3 acquisition and the other product expansion, product development we\u2019re doing. We think there\u2019s significant opportunity there the next couple of years to do something very meaningful.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ","Is there timing on when the Tier 3 integration really kind of kicks into high gear and you can start benefitting from that acquisition?","Glen F. Post III ","We\u2019re thinking second quarter it kicks in really at a much higher level. We\u2019re talking about midyear, our target. We\u2019ve already begun selling it and integrating it in some ways, but a full integration, we\u2019re thinking second quarter.","And regarding acquisitions, we\u2019re focused on our key strategic initiatives, and we think there\u2019s good growth of these, and bringing more MPLS, Ethernet, expanding our Prism opportunities, connect the home, the connected office work that we\u2019re doing. So we think there\u2019s significant opportunities there. At the same time, we will consider inorganic opportunities that will help drive growth, really. We\u2019ll maintain our disciplined approach to these decisions, and we\u2019ll just look for the right opportunities that can really grow shareholder value. That will be our goal.","","Operator","And our next question comes from Batya Levi with UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS ","Strategic wholesale revenues grew for the first time in a while, and you had mentioned before that you expect wireless backhaul to grow in \u201914. Can you provide more color on the timing of that? Can we see that early on in the year? And then also, within your guidance for the year, for revenues, which is looking for an improvement in the rate of decline, can you talk about your assumption you have for strategic in there?","William Cheek ","Let me just talk to you a little bit about the timing and the growth of backhaul revenues. We are continuing to build out our fiber to the tower initiative, and we\u2019ll have completed [unintelligible] really about 18,800 or so towers next year with adding another 3,000 to 3,500. We are expecting to see revenue compression start to mitigate. It won\u2019t happen earlier in the year. There\u2019s a fairly major reduction in some DS1s when a large carrier turned down the push to talk network, and that affected everyone in the industry. So we\u2019re having to live through that a little bit, but we do expect that we\u2019ll mitigate towards the latter part of the year.","Batya Levi - UBS ","And in terms of strategic services growth within your guidance?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","We are expecting our strategic revenue growth to improve in 2014, and think it will be led by our broadband, our Prism, and our data hosting areas and the success that we continue to have with business customers in the business segment.","Batya Levi - UBS ","It\u2019s about 50% of revenues going to now to [45%]. Should we expect that trend to continue?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","Yes. ","Operator","And our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James "," ","Looking at some of the IP trials that are at the [unintelligible], do you see any value in pursuing that yourself? And then can you comment on the managed office platform that you recently launched? When do you start to get traction with that in the [unintelligible] segment?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","I\u2019ll comment on the [unintelligible] trials and Karen will discuss managed office. But yes, we would expect to be involved in the [unintelligible] trials, alongside the other major carriers there, so that we\u2019ll be in a position to move in that direction and get all the learnings that we would get from a trial.","Karen Puckett","In terms of managed office, we\u2019ve really just begun to roll that out in late fourth quarter. But we are really encouraged by the traction and the funnel that we\u2019re seeing. It is a different sell for our sales reps, but it\u2019s very simple for the business owner, right? Because it allows them to have their information technology simply on a per-seat basis, and it bundles a business grade data network and a hosted VOIP service, with cloud based applications for EMLs and storage, really all in one package. And so we\u2019re also enabling that with our MTU fiber to the building. And we\u2019ll keep you posted, but we\u2019re very encouraged. And the sales team has given us a lot of good feedback, and we think it\u2019s going to change the dialogs they\u2019re going to be able to have in front of the customer.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Smithen with Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research ","I just had a follow up on an earlier question. Given your sequential improvement over the past couple of quarters in broadband and Prism TV, I guess why wouldn\u2019t you launch new markets and try to pass as many homes as possible this year? And given that interest rates have fallen, why not take up lever slightly to fund both the capex and a buyback to try to get to revenue and EBITDA breakeven as quickly as possible and retire shares?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","We\u2019re certainly looking at new markets and evaluating new markets and the cost of going into them. And we really wanted to see a little bit more success. You know, we really just turned up the Omaha market in September or October on a commercial basis. And we\u2019ve done really well there. We\u2019ve done well in Las Vegas, where we have fiber to the home. We\u2019ve done well in Colorado Springs. So I think we want to see a little bit more performance and just make sure it really lasts, which we certainly believe it will, and all indications are that it will. But rest assured that we\u2019re looking at other potential markets that we could provide Prism service.","Glen F. Post III ","When you look at revenue growth opportunity, look at Prism, it\u2019s certainly one that, as Stewart just said, we\u2019re looking hard at. That would involve some additional capex. I don\u2019t think a whole lot for this 2014. But it also impacts our startup expenses, or EBITDA. So we would have to take a look at that. But if we did, we\u2019d come back to investors and explain, that we\u2019re doing this to accelerate revenue. We\u2019re seeing significant success in these markets, and this is why we\u2019re doing it. But that would be the issue we deal with if we decided to make a move to more aggressively invest in Prism TV in the coming months. "," ","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research ","And what would roughly the capex be per market and opex, for startup?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","It\u2019s really hard to say. It varies by market, and it depends on the quality of the plant that\u2019s there today, and how much work needs to be done. So it\u2019s really very difficult to generalize. But again, if we continue to have good success in the markets that we\u2019re in, we\u2019ll keep evaluating in other markets, and come back to you guys like Glen indicated.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research ","What\u2019s the max leverage ratios you feel comfortable with exiting 2014?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","What we\u2019ve said is that basically three times is really our bogey.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research ","I guess the first question is, if you just look out three to five years, is there a sense of what broadband speed a home needs given the evolution of technology and over the top type of applications? And then if you have a view there, how the company is working backwards to try to get the portfolio in better shape in aggregate to get to that goal. ","And then just secondly, on the consumer side as well, are you seeing any changes to the way customers are using bandwidth, using internet, that you could just give us a sense of whether it\u2019s volume growth or usage per household, and maybe how it\u2019s different in a fiber to node fed home versus a straight up copper home? ","Karen Puckett","In terms of the broadband, everyone has an opinion. We\u2019ve made good investment in our ADSL, VDSL, really VDSL, technology as well as our fiber to the [perim]. And you know, 33 meg to 53 meg, we believe we can be successful at. With bonding, we can get well beyond that. But really, what we\u2019re focused on is the functionality and the capability, so Prism and the connect the home we\u2019re pretty excited about. We continue to push the technology team in getting more efficient, and we\u2019re encouraged by some work that we have going on that we\u2019ll be talking about in future quarters. So I think from the standpoint of how we\u2019re positioned, we feel good about where we\u2019re positioned right now.","Glen F. Post III "," ","If you look at it, you know, we have 65% of our households can get access to 10 meg or higher, on an unbonded basis, not bonded. Almost 40% can get access at 20 megs or higher on a nonbonded basis. ","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research ","And just to follow up, if you have some details also on usage for home and maybe growth in broadband traffic over the last year, that would be great.","Glen F. Post III ","The growth, basically in the average monthly download, was 44 GB, which was an increase of 24% quarter to quarter. The median monthly download, however, was 16 GB, which is, again, about a 25% increase quarter to quarter. So the top 1% of our subscribers represented 11% of the total traffic, basically. And 20% represented 70% of the total traffic.","Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research ","And then just one final question, if I could. Is there a way to think about your capex in terms of what\u2019s a general bucket of the network, you know, that supports all of the segments? And then maybe the capex specifically for consumer versus business. I know you\u2019ve laid out some bogeys already on fiber to the tower, but is there a way to think about how you have this pool of broad capex, but then you could identify maybe some of the pieces for us, just think through where you\u2019re [pacing] your dollars?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","You know, we\u2019ll spend $400 million or so on broadband expansion enhancement this year, and another $150 million on our Prism TV products. We have a lot of success based capital with our business customers, but that\u2019s all the detail we really want to give you now. It\u2019s going to be slightly less for fiber to the tower in 2015. It will be more like into $200 million, depending upon the requirements there.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sergey Dluzhevskiy from Gabelli & Company. ","Sergey Dluzhevskiy - Gabelli & Company ","Two questions. One for Glen on M&A. Could you update us on your M&A philosophy and potential areas of interest. Obviously you guys have mentioned in the past that you have the right mix of assets to return to revenue stabilization, and eventually to grow, but to the extent that you would look to augment this growth through acquisitions, what areas would be of primary interest to you?","And also, one question for Karen, on 1 gigabit service offerings. Maybe if you could share with us some initial learnings from Omaha and Las Vegas, and what are your expectations for these markets and for 1 gigabit offerings in general, as you roll them out?","Glen F. Post III ","Regarding the acquisition approach we\u2019re taking, we don\u2019t feel like we are compelled to make an acquisition, but to the extent we can find companies that can accelerate our growth, that we are interested, we\u2019d expect it to be revenue growth accretive, also free cash flow accretive, I think we said within 12 months. And it has to drive long term shareholder value. So those are the three things we look for. And the recent acquisitions we\u2019ve made, all those fit this criteria, basically. They all are especially poised to enhance our growth in the months ahead, and we\u2019ll continue to look for those. These are all the small ones, but even larger ones we consider. But those are the primary criteria we\u2019ll be looking for in acquisition target.","Karen Puckett","And regarding the gig learnings from Omaha and Vegas, still early, but again, we are really encouraged by the results there. We are seeing strong pull through, just overall, two to three times in terms of HSI, even outside the gate footprint as well as in impact on business customers. So we have landed some new business opportunities just because of what we would call a halo effect in these two markets.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jonathan Epstein from Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Epstein - Deutsche Bank ","First, on your comments about the dividend, you\u2019ve previously expressed the desire to keep the 2015 dividend payout ratio under 60% of adjusted free cash flow. Is that still the foundation of the dividend policy? And if so, is it a litmus test? Or is there any wiggle room there, especially considering the forthcoming renewal of share repurchases? And then just a follow up on a previous question. Was the $60 million savings in the quarter originally contemplated in \u201913 guidance? And can we expect savings of this magnitude in the fourth quarter of this year, of course baking in the tax savings that you already mentioned that you expect?","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","","Last question first. No, this was not in our guidance for the fourth quarter or full year, really. We always have a few adjustments during the fourth quarter, more related to property taxes and the true-up of our income tax rate for the year and things like that. You know, minor items. But it just turned out to be much more significant this year because we had a number of employee benefit items that have been much smaller in the past. So it was not baked into guidance, and we would not expect that to reoccur in 2014.","In terms of the dividend, we basically indicated that we thought we could keep the payout ratio around 60% in 2015 when we became a cash taxpayer. It\u2019s not really a litmus test, and there is certainly wiggle room from there, so it\u2019s just where we thought we would be at the time that we indicated that. And so it\u2019s not set in stone, basically, that if we get above 60% we have to take action. So we\u2019re good with the dividend. We\u2019re comfortable with the dividend where it is, and we\u2019re comfortable looking out a few years to the time when we become a [full cash] taxpayer, that, based on our business plans today, we would not have to change the dividend.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Adam Ilkowitz from Nomura. ","Adam Ilkowitz - Nomura","Quick question on the data hosting segment. Can you give a little detail on how much Tier 3 added to the growth rate? I know we\u2019re lapping Cyber a bit, but I was wondering how much the managed hosting growth was actually organic. And then a question on cash flow beyond \u201914. I know it\u2019s a little out there, but thinking about cash taxes going up and capital spending for some of these initiatives going down, given that you\u2019re having success with GPON and with fiber on the business in consumer side, does this change how you\u2019re thinking about capex and the speed requirements and moving more to fiber than VDSL and bonding in the future, and how that would impact the capex budget going forward? ","Jeff Von Deylen","On the first question, for the quarter, the Tier 3 acquisition added about $1.6 million in revenue for the quarter. And then just full disclosure, we get about a $2 million benefit for exchange rate favorability. But the rest of the managed hosting cloud growth would have been organic. So we had a very strong quarter sequentially in terms of growth and new business customers that we added and got installed during the quarter. ","R. Stewart Ewing Jr. ","And on your second question, in terms of GPON and Prism impact, and how we might think about capital expenditures and leverage related to that, really we believe we have enough capital built into the budgets in the out years to be able to do what we need to do to adequately serve our customers and compete with the cable companies and other competitors. If we did get to the point where we felt like we needed to drive more fiber than we\u2019re planning on today, and expand into many more Prism markets, we would certainly come back and talk with you about that and have the case associated with that to sell that. ","But basically at this point, we plan on really using multiple technologies to provide higher speeds to our customers, and think we can continue to really have success there. Again, we\u2019ll monitor Omaha and the gigabit fiber trial there, as well as where we\u2019ve rolled it out in Las Vegas, and see what success we have and make decisions later. But for now, we believe that with other technologies, we can basically be competitive. ","Operator","I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen F. Post III ","Thank you, operator. Overall, we are well pleased with our strong fourth quarter and solid full year 2013 operating results and financial results. We believe the investments in our key strategic initiatives continue to position us to effectively compete in the marketplace and drive revenue growth from our strategic products and services into the future.

Glen?","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink\u2019s second quarter 2012 results and guidance for the third quarter and full year 2012 as we provide an update as well about our business.","During the second quarter CenturyLink achieved solid results and we continue to make good progress on a number of fronts. As announced previously, we restructured operating groups during the second quarter. We completed the reorganization successfully with minimal disruption of our business operations; we are pleased with the results of that restructuring.","Our national and international legacy Business Markets Group, BMG customers, our Savvis customers and Federal Government customers are now served by new Enterprise Markets Group or EMG, and our end region large business customers and state and local government customers are now served by our Regional Markets Group, RMG. We believe this restructuring strengthens our ability to better serve our business and government customers locally, nationally and internationally.","We also continue to make good progress with integration of Qwest and Savvis and remain on-track to meet our synergy targets for these transactions. Our operating group restructuring is just one example of how we continue to further integrate these acquisitions in to CenturyLink.","Additionally, we continue to see solid bookings in our enterprise business segment and we continue to map integrated network, co-location, managed hosting and cloud services and we continue to invest in additional data center capacity to position us to drive further growth from these services in the months ahead.","With our fiber-to-the-tower initiative we continue to make excellent progress in completing power builds and enabling high bandwidth Ethernet data services to support the growing demand for wireless data backhaul capacity.","As we have previously discussed, while this transition rather than from traditional copper based data services to fiber based data connectivity create some near term revenue pressure, we are confident our investments in fiber-to-the-tower will generate good returns and provide solid revenue growth over the seven to 10 year lives of these agreements.","Finally, we remain on schedule and launched Prism TV services in our first legacy Qwest market later this year and also on schedule to launch our (inaudible) managed hosting and cloud services platform for businesses in the fourth quarter of this year.","Now turning to slide five. During the quarter, we made good progress in improving our topline revenue trend. We generated revenue of $4.61 billion or 1.2% year-over-year decline comparing favorably to the 3.8% decline and the 2.7% decline for proforma second quarter 2011 and first quarter of 2012 respectively. Excluding data integration revenues which widely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the annual revenue decline in second quarter was 1.7%.","For full year 2012, we remain on-track to reduce our annual revenue rate of decline to the 1.5% to 2.5% range. The integration of Qwest and Savvis remain on-track and we will continue to leverage these assets to strengthen our competitive position throughout our operating areas.","As well at the end of the second quarter, we achieved an annual synergy run-rate in excess of $380 million related to the Qwest integration. We continue to expect to end 2012 at an annual synergy run rate of $465 million related to Qwest. Also in the second quarter, we delivered further access line loss improvement and subscriber growth in broadband and Prism TV services.","We continue to scale our Prism TV service in the eight markets where it is available today and are progressing on our plans to roll Prism out in the first leg of Qwest market later this year. We remain focused on delivering advanced communications solutions and data hosting services to businesses as key factors of improving our topline revenue trend.","As of the second quarter business customers drive more than 60% of our total operating revenues and during the quarter, we generated strong strategic data growth from our business customers in both RMG and EMG.","Moving to slide six I\u2019ll provide a few highlights regarding our key strategic initiatives. As we have outlined we are focused on continued investment in broadband expansion and enhancement. Prism TV, fiber-to-the-tower and managed hosting and cloud computing services; our second quarter results reflects the solid progress we are making in these key initiatives. Starting with broadband expansion enhancement, we continue to make significant investments and during the second quarter we had over 18,000 high speed Internet subscribers. We saw some weakness in demand, but second quarter is a seasonally weak quarter as we have significant presence in two snow bird states Florida and Arizona.","Our customer retention efforts and the growth benefits of bundling broadband with other products and services resulted in the continued decline of the rate of access line loss in our business improving with 7.4% in the second quarter 2011 to 6.1% at second quarter of 2012.","We expanded our Fiber-To-The-Node [FTTN] infrastructure to an additional 215,000 living units during the quarter and now passed nearly 6.6 million living units with Fiber-To-The-Node and we expect to pass approximately 7 million living units by end of this year. As a result, our network investment enhancements, broadband speed availability has also continued to improve.","Nearly 70% of enabled access lines now receive speeds of 6 megabits or higher and more than 55% of our enabled lines receive 10 megabits or higher and 27% have speeds of 20 megabits or higher. We expect to continue to make investments in our network to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets.","Turning to slide seven; our Prism TV service represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to Cable TV service in the eight markets of where it\u2019s currently available and it continues to perform well for us. We added over 9,000 Prism TV subscribers during the second quarter into period with over 94,000 subscribers.","The new customers we've added over the past 12 months, approximately 50% are new customer to CenturyLink. We now have a penetration rate of over 9% across the eight markets in which the service is now available. In addition, we continue to enhance our IPTV experience by introducing new functionality and applications.","This quarter we launched our (inaudible) application allowing our customers to aggregate multiple channels on one screen and new TV applications as well, including Facebook, Picasa, Weather Channel, Yahoo! Sports and others that we've enabled this quarter. Prism TV continues to have a positive impact on churn and line loss trends and we experienced a greater than 90% broadband pull-through rate with our Prism TV sales to new customers.","Approximately 65% of Prism customers have a triple play bundle with CenturyLink and the ARPU by the way is between $165 to $170, a really strong average revenue per customer with our Prism bundles. We continue to see an annualized 350 to 400 basis point improvement in churn for customers taking our Prism product. We remain focused on expanding our Prism TV enabled footprint in driving additional subscriber growth and we are on-track to launch Prism TV again in our first Qwest market in the coming months.","And turning on to slide eight, our third key strategic initiative is investing in fiber builds there are many towers in our service areas economically feasible. Now these initiatives supports anticipates long term growth in data transport both of which is driven by wireless data traffic expanse our addressable customer footprint by enabling fiber access points to other strategic locations were viable along these routes. ","During the second quarter we completed approximately 1,350 fiber builds this is in line with expectations and we continue to anticipate completing 4,000 to 5,000 builds in 2012 as fiber-to-the-tower construction season ramp up through the remainder of the year. ","We believe our fiber-to-the-tower program have solidify our wholesale special access revenue for the long-term and assist in stabilizing our revenue trend. As we discussed with you before we do expect some near term revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers' transition from copper-based DS1s backhaul facilities to fiber based Ethernet services. And we believe they continue the acceleration in wireless data consumption will drive increases in Ethernet service revenue will offset any revenue compression within a reasonable period of time and provide solid growth over the seven or 10 year lives of the associated contracts. ","Moving on slide nine, we continue to invest in Managed hosting and cloud service to increase data center capacity as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. During the quarter we announced our 2012 plan data center expansion in seven markets four of which were online in the second quarter. And we also lost our Savvis Symphony Virtual Private Data Center product cloud solution in (inaudible) and all these service in five locations across three continents. We continue to focus on leveraging multiple sales channels to drive further growth in data hosting services and at the end of the second quarter we are seeing significant growth in potential sales of hosting products within the EMG network and RMG segments. ","And in the months ahead, we will focus on allowing hosting product offerings and solutions bundles with existing RMG and EMG network client as we see that demand continuing to grow. We ended the second quarter with 50 datacenters in North America, Europe and Asia with total salable force of about 1.4 million square feet. On July 31, we announced the acquisition of certain assets Ciber\u2019s Global IT Outsourcing or ITO business. The addition of these assets will complement Savvis existing ITOs assets by expanding their capabilities for application management services and help desk support. ","And now on slide 10 and a summary I am pleased with our second quarter financial results. We continue to improve our top line revenue trend. Our employees did a good job of containing costs and we've generated solid cash flows during the quarter. ","We reduced our access line losses by 22% compared to proforma second quarter of 2011 and we grew high speed internet and Prism customer bases during the quarter. We also made solid progress in our key strategic initiatives that we believe positions us well to continue to improve our top line revenue trend in the months ahead. ","Let me now turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results.","Stewart Ewing","","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then I'll provide a brief liability management update and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2012 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Now turning to slide 12 first, in order to provide more relevant comparisons, I will be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Savvis was fully included in the results of all periods. I will also be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. With that let's turn to our results for the second quarter.","As you can see, we generated strong operating revenues and solid cash flows. Operating revenues were $4.6 billion on a consolidated basis exceed in our guidance for the quarter and represent a 1.2% decline from pro forma second quarter 2011 operating revenues.","This also represents a solid improvement from the 3.8% revenue annual decline in the year ago period. Excluding data integration revenue, the year-over-year decline in revenue is 1.7%. Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 45% of total revenue from 43% in pro forma second quarter a year ago due to growth in strategic products such as high-speed internet, data services, Prism TV and Managed hosting services. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.65 exceeding guidance by driven primarily by higher growth and strategic revenue than anticipated and a one-time adjustments to depreciation expense. As we discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items as certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. ","Total cash operating expenses increased modestly from pro forma second quarter a year ago to second quarter 2012 with synergy achievement and other cost reductions partially offset by continued investments in our key strategic initiatives as well as other related revenue growth.","We generated solid operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 41.2%. Additionally, we generated $779 million of free cash flow during the quarter which is defined as operating cash flow less cash taxes paid, interest, cash interest as well as capital expenditures and an additional adjustments to other income.","Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet the business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. As a result, our operating group restructured that Glen discussed earlier, the segment financial information has been realigned this quarter to support this new operating structure. ","We have also provided a supplemental financial schedule this quarter that provides restated historical quarterly segment financial information retroactive to first quarter 2011. The four segments are defined as follows, regional markets group is reported as one segment and includes region market groups, financial information as previously reported along with revenues and related direct and allocated costs associated with the in region large business customers and state and local government customers transferred through the region markets group from legacy business markets group. ","In appliance markets group is operated and reported as two segments, first the network services segment includes the network services revenues and related direct and allocated cost associated with the national and international business markets grew customers and federal government customers transferred to EMG from BMG along with Savvis operating group's network services customers. ","Second, the data hosting services segment includes Colocation and Managed Hosting and Cloud services revenues and related direct and allocated cost associated with the national and international business markets group customers and federal government customers transferred to the EMG group from legacy BMG group along with Savvis operating groups, data hosting services customers. ","Wholesale market groups is reported as one segment and includes the wholesale market groups, financial information as previously provided along with revenues and the related direct and allocated costs associated with the Savvis operating group wholesale customers that we transferred by Savvis. ","Now turning to slide 13, I will begin the operating segment\u2019s discussion today with our regional markets group. Regional markets group generated $2.48 billion in operating revenues which represents a decrease of 2.6% over pro forma second quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $894 million in the quarter up 5.8% pro forma year-over-year excluding the impact of product line revenue, strategic revenues grew approximately 7%. ","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined to $122 million or 7.5% from pro forma second quarter 2011 due primarily to a continuing decline in revenues related to access lines. Our expanse reductions for the second quarter compared to the previous year were mainly driven by lower employee related costs, professional fees and marketing and advertising costs which were partially offset by higher Prism TV and data integration expenses. ","Moving to slide 14, our wholesale markets group generated $944 million in operating revenue, a decrease of 4.1% from pro forma second quarter 2011. This decline was a result of wireless and other wholesale carrier bandwidth revenue growth being more than offset by the continued decline in access and long distance revenues. ","Strategic revenues for WMG grew 2.1% to $572 million from pro forma second quarter 2011, primarily driven by continued strong data transport demand from wireless providers.","WMG\u2019s legacy revenues declined by 12.3% to $372 million, reflecting the continued decline in access and long distance revenues. WMG\u2019s operating expenses for the quarter were $286 million or 6.8% below the pro forma period from a year ago.","Moving to slide 15, EMG network services segment generated $648 million in operating revenues during the second quarter which represented an increase of 2% from pro forma second quarter 2011.","The second quarter represented the second consecutive quarter of sequential growth in recurring revenues for the network services segment. Second quarter strategic revenues for EMG network services increased by $9 million or 2.8% to $333 million from pro forma second quarter 2011, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services, such as MPLS, Ethernet and DWDM. Excluding private line services, strategic revenue grew nearly 7% from the pro forma year ago period.","Legacy revenue for EMG network services declined by $8 million from pro forma second quarter 2011 due primarily to declines in local and legacy WAN services while data integration revenues increased $12 million or 14% due to higher equipment sales and professional services revenues from government and enterprise customers. Our total segment expenses in EMG network services were virtually flat from a same period a year ago.","Now turning to slide 16. In our EMG Data Hosting Services segment, which is primarily legacy Savvis operations. This segment generated $277 million in operating revenues representing an increase of 6.5% from pro forma second quarter 2011 revenues of $260 million. There is an additional $45 million of data hosting revenues reflected in other segments. We expect to provide a schedule that will reflect total data hosting revenues across this company on our website early next week. This growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 4.7% in collection revenues and 11.5% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues and a modest increase in network services revenues.","Strong bookings in data hosting services in the prior two quarters helped drive this revenue growth in the second quarter. A solid pipeline and additional capacity will support continued revenue growth in the second half of 2012. EMG data hosting operating expenses were $211 million in the second quarter compared to $196 million from pro forma second quarter 2011. This increase of 7.7% is driven by an added headcount in operations and sales and marketing staff to support revenue growth.","As reflected in slide 17, we continue to make good progress on our liability management plans. In 2011 we set a target to repay $1.5 billion to $2 billion of gross debt from pro forma basis as of December 31, 2010 over the two-year period ending December 31, 2012.","We remain on track to reach this goal as we've accomplished approximately $1.5 billion of our target excluding debt financings year-to-date for July. If you consider year-to-date refinancings including the associated premiums incurred to call data associated with the refinancings we've accomplished about $1.1 billion of our target. Recent liability management actions have extended to weighted average maturity of our debt by approximately two years and slightly decreased our weighted average interest rate.","The chart reflects the change in annual debt maturities and as you can see these recent actions positions CenturyLink well from a debt maturity standpoint through 2017. Maturities over the five year period of 2013 through 2017 have declined over 35% from $9 billion to $5.6 billion making the annual maturities over that period very manageable.","As a result of the refinancing and debt reductions over the last several months, we currently expect interest expense to decline modestly each quarter through the remainder of 2012. The Pension Relief Act passed as part of the highway bill in June reduced our required pension contributions by approximately $1 billion over the next three years.","We currently expect our required contribution to be $100 million in 2013. This compares with an unexpected contribution of about $500 million in 2013 prior to the passage of the legislation.","Slide 18 addresses our third quarter and full year 2012 guidance. CenturyLink expects growth and strategic revenue in the third quarter. However we also expect third quarter 2012 revenues to be negatively impacted by the decline in access revenues as a result of the implementation of the FCC\u2019s USF\/SEC transformational order and the reduction effective July 1, 2012 in monthly universal service contribution rate assessed to end users, which will be partially offset by the implementation of Access Recovery Charges in accordance with the order. The total negative revenue impact of these three items on the third quarter compared with the second quarter will be about $25 million.","Operating expenses are also anticipated to increase in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to second quarter of 2012 due to the normal seasonality of outside plant maintenance and utility costs which we believe approximates an additional $50 million, increased data center operating costs as a result of some of the expansions that we\u2019ve done in our data hosting area; and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $20 million which will be partially offset by other operating efficiencies.","For the third quarter of 2012, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.54 billion to $4.59 billion and operating cash flow between $1.82 billion and $1.86 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.54 to $0.59. The company expects fourth quarter 2012 operating revenues and operating cash flow to increase compared to third quarter 2012 due to anticipated continued growth in strategic revenues and lower outside plant maintenance and utility marketing costs.","Slide 19 reflects our full-year 2012 guidance. Our operating revenue, we expect it to be $18.3 billion to $18.4 billion which is consistent with the guidance that we gave last quarter or actually it's up a $100 million on the lower end. Our operating cash flow from $7.5 billion to $7.65 billion, adjusted diluted EPS from $2.45 to $2.55, capital expenditures from $2.7 billion to $2.8 billion and free cash flow from $3.25 billion to $3.4 billion. In essence we've tightened our ranges and increased the midpoints of our guidance by moving the bottom of our ranges up to reflect our year-to-date performance","Turning to Slide 20, in summary we are investing to drive growth in our strategic initiatives that we believe will result in continued improvement of our top line revenue trend. We continue to believe a solid balance sheet is important to have financial flexibility and feel confident about our cash flow generate-ability which allows CenturyLink to return meaningful cash to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks for you today. So, at this time I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) and our first question comes from Simon Flannery [Morgan Stanley].","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","You mentioned the pension impact. Can you give us an update on the labor negotiations with the contract up in October and what you are hoping to achieve from those. Also noted that you were doing some metro fiber builds in Charlotte. Perhaps you can provide a little bit more color on how extensive those metro deployments are and are we going to see more of those over time and what\u2019s the sort of the payback on some of those projects?","Glen Post","Yes, Simon. Regarding the union negotiations, we are not going to really discuss any specifics at this time, but we could be looking for ways to really better align our cost of revenue sources. That will be our primary objective.","The Qwest contract expires October 6th. We\u2019ll be well prepared for the possibility of a strike, but we remain really cautiously optimistic that we will be able to reach agreement with the CWA and IBEW. We will negotiate in good faith and expect the CWA and IBEW leaders do the same.","However, you just never know until the negotiations are over as we have seen this past week with AT&T sort of things happening there. But we're cautiously optimistic and have begun preliminary discussions with them.","Stewart Ewing","And Simon, on the metro fiber build at Charlotte, I am not familiar with that one. (Inaudible) build I know that we do, we are building to customers as we pickup additional customers and it makes sense from an economic standpoint.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","So there is no real change in your mix of CapEx?","Stewart Ewing","No, there is no real change. I mean we are doing some data center builds. We are building in some data centers that we have not been built into previously. We are also in conjunction with Savvis doing some work there to basically integrate their network with our network and give some redundancy to some of the data centers that Savvis has. So, we are doing some things like that, but there is no real specific change in our CapEx budget or philosophy there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan [Raymond James]","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Can you give us an idea on the enterprise side, so what percentage of new RFPs and things are incorporating more to the Savvis type products versus the more traditional voice and data products.","And looking at your fiber-to-the-tower expansion there, are there any fiber-to-the-tower builds that you are seeing that are uneconomic, that you're walking away from or you are pretty much going after everything that comes up?","Glen Post","Frank, I'll get the last one first. With respect to fiber-to-the-tower, we are walking away from some of the builds that aren\u2019t economic for us. It's really very, very insignificant I think and I mean generally if we can't build a tower, no one else can either.","And we are not seeing a lot of people build in our markets that we're aware of from the standpoint of the towers that we wouldn\u2019t be willing to build to. So with the agreements that we have with major carriers and some of the smaller carriers as well, we feel very good about our ability to be able to capture the revenue that would otherwise be cannibalized from the wireless providers.","Stewart Ewing","Frank, I'll make a brief comment about the (inaudible) to talk to more about your question about the RFPs. I don\u2019t have the RFP percentages, but I just know in our dealing with customers and the request we are receiving from our large customers, I would say that the vast majority are talking about the Savvis type or the cloud hosting products that I talk with. And that as I talk with our sales folks around the country and they are very interested; some long sales cycles here, but a lot of interest. And Jim, you want to --","Jim Ousley","Frank, I would just reinforce that now with the combination of the old BMG enterprise sales force working together, virtually every one of our major enterprise CenturyLink customers are now interested in talking about Savvis products. So we are not seeing a big change in the RFP type alignment; but clearly every major customer is now talking about Savvis products and vice-versa. The Savvis enterprise customers are requesting information on CenturyLink capabilities, so we are going to see leverage from it, no question about it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Barden [Bank of America-Merrill Lynch].","Unidentified Analyst","Hey guys, this is Julia (inaudible) for Dave. Thanks for taking the question. I guess just on synergies and so where they are coming in this year; is it more sort of fourth quarter weighted or are we going to see some in the third quarter; may be just some detail on kind of exactly where those synergies are coming from? And then just a side note, you guys put in the supplemental breakdown of Savvis; are going to continue to give that going forward? Thanks.","Glen Post","","So we ended the quarter at a run rate of about $380 million, so we still expect ending the year about $465 million or so. We will see incremental synergies in the third quarter and then we will see some other incremental synergies in the fourth quarter as well. So I would say if you are doing a model basically spread evenly and you will be in a pretty good shape. Also we will continue to breakout Savvis as we did this quarter and the rest of the year.","And we're probably going to do more than just bringing Savvis out; I think we're going to provide you with a schedule. We have data hosting. Our segments are really more about customers. So we have customers, the Wholesale Group and the RMG Group that also have hosting services and we are basically going to provide you a schedule of all of the hosting revenue across the company, so we\u2019ll get that hopefully on the website next week or so.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from [Nicole Black]","Unidentified Analyst","Stewart, I was hoping you could clarify the comment you made about the $1.5 billion debt reduction excluding debt refinancing, we look at that does not net out the $2 billion of bond issuance that CenturyLink did in March of the $900 million of bond issuance that Qwest Corp. has done this year?","Stewart Ewing","","So basically, when we first look at the debt pay downs that we will do; we didn\u2019t know what refinancings we will do. So we basically looked at the maturities that were coming up as well as the other debt that was going to be coming due. The debt was going to be coming due plus other debt that I am not able to recall. And we were going to get to $1.5 billion to $2 billion.","The $1.5 billion really includes everything that we have paid off to-date that was a scheduled maturity or something that we could call early. The other the $1.1 billion really takes into consideration all the refinancings that we did and the associated premiums that we had to pay as well.","So we paid about $350 million to $400 million of premiums associated with the debt that we called associated with the refinancings that allowed us to really get our maturity towers to where we needed to get them for the next five years.","Unidentified Analyst","Does that mean $1.1 billion is how much you have accomplished against the $1.5 billion to $2 billion goal?","Glen Post","","If you look at it that way then basically we will probably get towards the lower end of the range maybe $1.4 billion or $1.5 billion or so because we have got a $319 million maturity that comes up August 15th that we expect to pay off and put it in credit facility, but we\u2019ll ultimately pay that off. If not by the end of fourth quarter or sometime during the first quarter; if you count the premiums that we had to pay and in fact then we\u2019ll get closer to the $2 billion.","So that\u2019s a way to look at it. The way to look at it really is we\u2019ll get kind of towards the bottom end if you look at net debt more or less; if you look at the debt including the premiums that we had to pay then basically we\u2019ll be closer to the top-end of the range.","Unidentified Analyst","And then at your Analyst Day I believe you cited that your leverage target of 2 to 2.5 range; do you have a timeframe associated with that?","Glen Post","","Yeah, we really don\u2019t; I mean our leverage with leases was about 2.8 times trailing 12 months and in the third quarter probably about 2.7 times or so to exclude leases and our target is more or less in that range, but not any specified period of time to get to there.","Unidentified Analyst","And the ratings agencies do count leases in their calculations, correct?","Glen Post","","Yeah, they do and of course Moody\u2019s has in their calculation and their target for us is to get down to 3 times and we are a little bit over 3 times now based on the target that they have for our rating.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Chris King [Stifel Nicolaus].","Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus","I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the regulatory issues that are impacting you in the third quarter to the tune of $25 million or so. And realizing there is a lot that\u2019s yet to be decided at the SEC level in terms of timing up of step downs and subsequent recovery mechanisms. Just was wondering if we could get your quick thoughts on kind of how you see that at least at this stage playing out over 2013 and as they say, right now you guys expecting to see another kind of $25 million step down in the middle of 2013, is that kind of your internal plans for right now and then secondly just wanted to get any of your latest thoughts regarding special access, I guess re-regulation at the (inaudible) and where that currently stands in your mind? Thanks.","Glen Post","So Chris the $25 million inclusive of $15 million step down in the USF contribution right, you know that will result in reduced revenue but it also results in reduced expense for us as well the way we account for. The access reform on a net basis, if you take the access charges that reduction which is I remember right about $30 million, $27 million, $30 million and you net that with the increase that we can flow through to our customers, it nets to about $10 million negative in the third quarter and of course that will recur, it will be flat in the fourth quarter. So next July, we will see another step down really don\u2019t know how much at this point and then we're in the process of building on our 2013 performance to go over with board and we will have that done by the mid-September so timeline but wouldn\u2019t expect anything more significant in the step down than we saw this year.","Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus","Thanks. And on the special access?","Glen Post","Yeah, basically, I mean, you know, we provided additional information to the SEC we know that this is something that\u2019s on their agenda to look at over time, I mean its been there for long time, I mean at this time there is plenty of competition in special access market so we don\u2019t really foresee any re-regulation of special access, I mean that would really be the long shot if that were to happen, its probably not in the near term.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Goldman [Goldman Sachs].","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","I wonder if you can may be talk a little about the revenue trajectory you guys highlighted in the $25 million impact in the third quarter but the trajectory would suggest the second half it should be about 1.2% decline and may be even little bit worse presumably in part due to 25 million with potential, possibly even sequential step up in the fourth quarter I just wonder if you guys can just kind of way out the trajectory for revenue and what some of the drivers there in the (inaudible) as well?","Stewart Ewing","","So if you look at the fourth quarter probably there will be about 6% decline, 1.6% decline from the year ago. ","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","Is it 1.6%?","Stewart Ewing","","Yeah, about 1.6% probably.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","I assume part of that just a tougher comp from the year ago quarter?","Glen Post","Yeah. ","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","And so I mean if your say 1.2 now obviously a tougher comp, how do you think about the trajectory over revenue going into 2013 in your ability to possibly even grow revenue on a sequential basis. ","Glen Post","Yeah, we are getting closer than before and if you take our last six quarters or eight quarters and just plow them out you can see that we make really good progress in terms of getting the hopefully flattening out revenue and starting to grow revenue, you know we mentioned in our EMG network segment to exclude the CPE type revenue basically that fluctuates you know we've seen our second quarter of sequential growth so we are getting close, I mean we are not ready to put a stake in the ground and say its 2013 or some time in 2013 or 2014 but we are definitely moving closer and we would expect our revenue decline in \u201913 to be lower than the decline that we end up with in 2012 because we expect continued growth in the network area, we are having good success with the local model that we have put in place in the markets where we are the primary telephone company and we are seeing improved growth we think in the second half of this year with respect to the data hosting revenues. So I mean if we think that\u2019s setting it pretty well.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs","And then just to follow-up on your commentary about the network segment I thought you know I was looking at the proforma information you put out, looks like a nice step up on the year-over-year improvement in strategic services, but in equally good step down actually and the rate of decline in the legacy services so maybe you can talk a little bit about what's driving that and just what your expectations are for data integration for the back half of the year.","Glen Post","Data integration is hard to say, I mean we've got a number of deals in the pipeline but it's hard to say when they might close, that gets pushed from time to time and quarter to quarter.","In terms of the strategic revenue, I mean we are seeing s good growth there. We are seeing good opportunities with larger business customers that have asked us to take a look at being a participant in providing services to them or taking over one of the other larger carriers or MPLS. And Ethernet growth is really strong and we expect it to continue to be strong during the rest of the year.","And some of that revenue growth is actually cannibalizing some of the other revenues that we have, some of the legacy revenues that we have.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael (inaudible).","Unidentified Analyst","Just looking at the Prism TV adds in the quarter, they are maybe little bit lighter than I would have expected given how new you guys are in that business. I was just wondering if you could talk about anything in the competitive environment that you are seeing or if there are any changes that you guys are anticipating making in terms of maybe promoting the service or anything else that you might be thinking or planning to jump start growth in Prism adds as you go forward?","Karen Puckett","In terms of the Prism TV, I mean in general second quarter has weak seasonality and high speed and in Prism and when I look at overall, we're happy with our inward. From a competitive standpoint, we continue to get really good comments from our customers and depending on which market at least 50% of our customers are new to our company and so it is a big inward driver for us. As we expand we'll continue work on just a distribution of the inwards, but not any competitive issues. In fact we are very pleased with the performance of (inaudible) right now.","Glen Post","And we do expect to increase some of the advertising in some of these markets in the last half of the year as well Michael.","Operator","Our next question comes from [Brian Turner].","Unidentified Analyst","Just one quick for me. Can you give us any color on potential conversations you have had with the rating agencies as you look forward towards the end of the year and into 2013. Specifically have they provided any granularity around the criteria they might be looking for in order to maintain or stabilize the current ratings?","Glen Post","Yes Brian well we are not investment grade at S&P. So we are finding their terms of the writing that we have today and wouldn\u2019t expect to get an upgrade there until we can show that we can stabilize revenue and start growing cash flow again.","With respect to Moody\u2019s and Fitch, on Moody\u2019s we have had conversations with them. They are target more or less to take the negative outlook of the parent company is to -- is basically for them to be able to see that we can get down to three times debt to EBITDA based on their calculation and they are willing to give us some time to do that and they understand where we are. We have a conversation with them each quarter and we have face to face visits a couple of times a year.","We expect to be able to give them our 2013 projections probably sometime after we meet with our Board in September. And again I think they want to be able to see clearly that we can get down to three times leverage on their basis in order to remove the negative outlook. With Fitch, the dividend payout ratio is more of what they look at and it's about 55% which is in line with where we are.","I think they are willing to potentially give us a little flexibility, if we need to make other investments that they can see are strategic investments from the standpoint of driving revenue in the future or preserving revenue. And example of that is fiber-to-the-tower. So, that's kind of where we are at the agencies.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, (inaudible). We are pleased with the continued progress we made during the second quarter for stabilizing topline revenues in our business. And we believe our continued investment in what we see as key strategic opportunities will help us continue to drive growth, both near term and long term.","Our strategic revenues continue to grow nicely and our guidance reflects our expectations that our revenues from strategic services will continue to grow in the months ahead. We also remain focused to ensuring that our operating costs are in line with our revenue mix and on achieving our operating expense synergy targets for the successful completion of the Qwest and Savvis integrations.","Additionally, the expansion of our Prism TV service and launch of managed hosting and cloud services for small and medium-sized businesses and customers. Later this year, we will further strengthen our product portfolio and provide us additional revenue and growth opportunity as we look into 2013. Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

So joining Glen on today's call is David Cole, CenturyLink's Executive Vice President, Operations Support & Controller. Also available during the question-and-answer portion of today's call will be Dean Douglas, CenturyLink's President of Enterprise Markets; and Maxine Moreau, CenturyLink's President of Consumer Markets.","Our call today will be available for a telephone replay through August 9, 2017 and the webcast replay of our call will be available through August 24, 2017. Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of today, August 2, and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","So, as we move to slide five, I'll now turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today. Beginning on slide six, I want to cover a few highlights for the second quarter as well as some important trends in our business.","Our second quarter colo revenue is below our expectations as we had higher losses in legacy revenues along with higher broadband unit losses and our growth in MPLS revenues was a litter lower than anticipated.","However, our adjusted EBITDA met our target. Our employees did a great job of controlling expenses and stayed focus even with all of the Level 3 acquisition integration planning activities that are in progress.","Second quarter Enterprise high-bandwidth data services revenues grew 1% year-over-year, although this growth is slower than the prior quarter adjusting for a contracted price reduction in wholesale and a favorable settlement in the year-ago period, Enterprise high-bandwidth data services revenue increased 5% year-over-year. We remain confident that the future growth opportunity for these services remains significant for a number of reasons.","First, we continue to outperform MPLS market growth projections forecasted by leading industry analysts. In second quarter, we had nearly 2,000 MPLS customers. This performance was driven in particular by our SMB customers, where we are seeing improved install intervals of nearly 20%, which should help accelerate our revenue recognition as we move into the third and fourth quarters of this year. Next, we launched a number of new products and \u2013 we've launched a number of new products in the past few months including our CenturyLink Ethernet service.","We've also had three simplified bundles of SD-WAN plus network packages. We rolled out a competitively priced cloud-enabled small business VoIP offering. And we rolled out a new comprehensive managed Enterprise offering that is an end-to-end solution that includes WiFi management, network management, video surveillance, security and mobility management, all from a single interface. Also we have increased focus on customer retention and we are seeing lower credits and adjustments as a result.","In addition, CenturyLink continues to be one of the leaders in network virtualization through the deployment of software-defined networking and network virtualization capabilities. Based on initial results, we expect these services to create significant value in the months ahead. Also the continuous onslaught of new security threats, such as WannaCry has brought greater interest in and sales of our strong network and cyber security capabilities, as we believe CenturyLink is growing in recognition as a leading provider of security services that are so important to our Enterprise customers.","And lastly, based on third-party research support, U.S. Enterprise high-bandwidth data services are forecast to grow at mid-single-digit compounded annual growth rates through 2021, and U.S. Enterprise Managed Network Services are forecast to grow at mid to upper single-digit compounded annual growth rates through 2021. Now this forecast gives even more confidence in the opportunity to continue to grow Enterprise business in the months ahead.","Second, our IT services revenue, which is primarily driven by IT consulting, cyber security, IT service management and big data and analytics, is growing. And our managed hosting business also showed a solid turnaround this quarter. The team overcame the market confusion and sales disruption created by the colocation sale and grew cloud revenue, especially driven or aided by our Cloud Application Manager suite.","Next as expected, we had a seasonally challenging quarter from consumer broadband subscribers approximately 65,000 residential subscriber loss was higher than anticipated. This was driven to a great degree of our stronger cable competition, particularly 1 gig offerings in some of our key markets, coupled with aggressive pricing. Over the past year, we have made a pivot towards higher-quality, more profitable consumer broadband sales by removing several low-priced promotional offers and increased credit standards.","As a result, despite the unit weakness, our consumer broadband revenue was flat sequentially. Additionally, we saw the lowest second quarter churn rate since the Qwest CenturyLink combination. We anticipate that the changes we're making will drive ongoing churn benefits. We continue to see higher levels of penetration and growth. We have 40 megabits of higher speeds available. We ended the second quarter with nearly 9.4 million 40 megabits in higher addressable locations and more than 3.8 million 100 megabits in higher addressable locations, representing an increase of 240,000 and 350,000 addressable locations respectively, during the quarter.","In second quarter we rolled out simplified service and price offerings that we called Price for Life, and part of our footprint, these simplified offers have improved sales trends and improved our early life churn results. We expect to further deploy these offers as well as continue to invest and improve customer and digital experiences and further speed enhancements in the months ahead. We expect these changes to improve our consumer broadband trends in the last half of the year.","Consumer video revenues were down year-over-year, primarily due to the restructuring of one of our satellite TV agreements discussed last quarter. We also made a pivot on our Prism product in the middle of the first quarter to focus more on profitability and overall customer lifetime value rested on top-line revenue or unit metrics.","Finally, revenues from legacy services primarily switched to voice service and low bandwidth data services have been declining for a number of years due to regulatory change, wireless' placement and technology transition to IP-enabled services. Although we believe the decline in our legacy revenues has been better than most of our peers, we have experienced higher levels of declines in recent months than we have in prior quarters.","Moving on to slide seven. We're making good progress in obtaining the necessary approvals to complete the pending acquisition of Level 3. We now have clearance from 23 states and territories with two additional state approvals needed. We continue to work diligently toward receiving the remaining state and federal approvals in order to close by the end of September. Also integration planning process is going very well and we are highly confident in our ability to achieve the $975 million annual run rate operating capital cash synergies target we provided when we announced the transaction last October.","The organization planning is moving along with several executive leaders naming their leadership teams. I'm looking forward to Jeff Storey joining us as COO at the time of close. Also we announced \u2013 as we announced, I'm planning to retire as CEO at the beginning of 2019. At that time, I will move to Executive Chairman and Jeff would take over as CEO, and I'm confident Jeff will do a great job. I believe we've assembled an incredibly talented and experienced leadership team that is well positioned to lead the combined company post-closing and drive growth and value in the months and years ahead.","Before turning it over to David, I'd like to comment on recent litigation regarding our consumer billing practices. This series of litigation began with a former CenturyLink employee filing a wrongful termination lawsuit that alleges our company charged some of our customers for products and services they did not authorize. That claim quickly escalated and a punitive class action being filed in multiple states. As best we can tell, in the claims in the former employee \u2013 on the former employee suit and a sampling of customer complaints pulled from social media.","In addition, a couple of weeks ago, the Minnesota Attorney General held a press conference announcing a lawsuit against CenturyLink, alleging that we engaged in improper sales and billing practices. We are limited in the things we can say while litigation and investigations are pending, but I do want to be very clear that the allegations contained in these lawsuits are contrary to everything I believe we stand for as a company. They do not represent our values, our principles or our commitment to always try to do the right thing in running our business. That said, we take these allegations seriously and are very diligently investigating them.","In addition to management's efforts, our board of directors appointed a special committee and hired the law firm O'Melveny & Myers to conduct an independent review of these issues. This decision was made immediately after learning about the initial lawsuit, not because there was evidence of wrongdoing, but because we wanted to be sure that our board had an independent view of these issues. I and our management team fully support this decision.","The special committee's process is underway, and we do not expect that it will be completed until fourth quarter. And while we are supporting those efforts, we cannot speak for the work before it's complete.","Our business and the systems that support it are complex. We serve millions of consumer customers and have thousands of interactions with them every day. Sometimes we do make mistakes just like anyone else, but suggestions that we defrauded our customers go against everything we strive to be as a company.","Whatever is found in the investigation of these matters we will be fair and do the right thing. We will defend ourselves where required and we will fairly address any mistakes we may have made, not because of the litigation, but because it's what we expect of ourselves.","I spent more than 40 years at CenturyLink including 25 as CEO. I've seen a lot of highs and lows during my tenure, but CenturyLink has always worked hard to maintain what I believe is a genuine commitment to honesty and integrity throughout our organization. And we are maintaining that commitment as we work through these issues.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss the results for the second quarter in more detail and review our third quarter guidance. David?","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes I'll review our second quarter results and provide an overview of third quarter 2017 guidance that we included in our earnings release issued earlier today.","Please note that I'll be reviewing some of these results excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. In addition, we have re-titled operating cash flow as adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow as adjusted free cash flow beginning this quarter. Also, as detailed in the earnings release, our quarterly results were impacted by the accounting for the data center and colocation sale on May 1, 2017. The net negative impact of one-time charges related to this sale was approximately $115 million of net income or approximately $0.21 per share.","Now turning to slide nine. CenturyLink reported second quarter results with revenues, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS all within our previously provided guidance ranges. Before going into the detail of the quarter, I do want to point out that our second quarter 2017 results do include the following impacts related to the colocation sale and leaseback entries that are required under GAAP accounting standards as referenced in the press release and reflected in the table to the right in this slide.","Just a summary of those impacts are about $12 million of operating revenues in the second quarter, a $3 million reduction in cost of services, a $117 million increase in SG&A expenses booked as a one-time loss on the sale, $54 million of depreciation expense with approximately $44 million of this amount representing a one-time catch-up entry. There was also $8 million of interest expense and $63 million of a related income tax benefit for these entries.","This accounting treatment will be followed through year end 2018 when the new lease accounting standard that was issued last year is implemented and these entries will no longer be required. We also provided these entries for comparison showing what the third quarter recurring impacts would be.","Second quarter operating revenue on a consolidated basis was approximately $4.1 billion, a 7% decrease from second quarter 2016 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.66 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of 7.9% from the year ago period. As a reminder, the sale of our data centers and the colocation business on May 1 resulted in approximately $100 million of this decline in core revenues compared to both the year-ago period and also to the prior quarter.","Operating income was $367 million for the second quarter, which reflects approximately $150 million in one-time charges related to the data center sale. We generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.44 billion for the second quarter and we achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.3% for the second quarter of the year. Our cash expenses for the second quarter decreased approximately $100 million year-over-year, primarily to the elimination of approximately $60 million related to the sold colocation business, as well as strong expense controls including lower salaries and wages expenses related to the head count reduction in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Adjusted free cash flow, defined as adjusted EBIT dollars, cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension OPEB costs, the ongoing impact of the ASC 840-40 accounting treatment related to the colo sale, stock-based compensation and other income was a negative $52 million for the quarter. This adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was lower primarily due to higher capital expenditures, seasonally higher cash interest and approximately $265 million of cash tax payments in the quarter.","We expect each of these items to decline from second quarter levels in the third quarter and fourth quarter, and I'll give a little bit more guidance on this a little later in the presentation. Our diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.03, a decrease from $0.36 in the year-ago period. Again, however, as a reminder, this EPS figure does include the $0.21 per share impact of the colocation entries mentioned earlier. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.46.","Moving to slide 10 and our Enterprise segment. In the second quarter, the Enterprise segment generated $2.22 billion in operating revenues, which decreased 9% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter Enterprise strategic revenues were $985 million, a decrease of 8.9% compared to the second quarter 2016. Excluding the revenue impact of the colocation sale, Enterprise strategic revenues grew slightly, and normalizing for high-bandwidth data revenues for contracted price reductions and a favorable settlement from the year-ago period, our Enterprises strategic revenues grew approximately 4%.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 10.1% for second quarter 2016, due primarily to a continuing decline in VoIP and low bandwidth data services revenues. Our total Enterprise segment expenses declined $87 million or 6.3% from second quarter 2016, primarily due to the reduction of approximately $60 million in expenses related to the sold colocation business in addition to other operating expense reductions.","Now turning to slide 11 and the Consumer segment. The Consumer segment generated approximately $1.4 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of 6.2% from second quarter 2016. Consumer strategic revenues declined 4% year-over-year to $768 million, due primarily to the restructuring of a satellite video contract and the impact of lower broadband units. While the satellite contract change was a one-time revenue reduction in the first quarter, it will continue to influence the year-over-year comparisons throughout the year 2017.","Our legacy revenue for the Consumer segment declined 8.8% from second quarter 2016, primarily due to access line declines. Our operating expenses declined $47 million or 7.4% from the year-ago period, primarily due to lower employee-related expenses.","Finally, turning to slide 12. I'd like to review our third quarter guidance along with a few notes for the remainder of the year. For third quarter 2017, we expect operating revenues of $4.06 billion to $4.12 billion; core revenues of $3.59 billion to $3.65 billion; and adjusted EBITDA between $1.43 billion and $1.49 billion. Our adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter is expected to range \u2013 following the range of $0.44 to $0.50.","CenturyLink anticipates our growth in strategic revenues to offset the expected declines in legacy revenues in third quarter 2017 compared to second quarter 2017, excluding the approximately $50 million decline in colocation revenue due to the timing of the sale during the second quarter of 2017.","The company also expects a slight increase in third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA compared to our second quarter 2017 results. Although we don't provide quarterly guidance for adjusted free cash flow, I do want to point out that we do expect the significant increase in third quarter 2017 adjusted free cash flow compared to second quarter 2017 results due to the seasonal timing of our cash interest and cash tax payments along with an anticipated decline in the level of capital expenditures in the third quarter of 2017 compared to the second quarter of 2017. Similar to prior years, we are still expecting to make a voluntary $100 million pension contribution during the third quarter.","Turning now to our full-year expectations; again, based on the first half 2017 results and our current expectations for the remainder of the year, we do anticipate coming in slightly below our full-year 2017 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance, primarily driven by higher legacy revenue decline and lower consumer broadband revenue growth than anticipated. The company continues to expect adjusted EBITDA and adjusted free cash flow to be near the lower end of our prior full-year guidance as we mentioned on last quarter's call.","CenturyLink is not providing updated guidance ranges for full-year 2017 due to the pending acquisition of Level 3, currently anticipated to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2017 and the expected consolidation of results for the combined company in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we are still expecting our dividend payout ratio to be in the mid to high 70% range for 2017. While we continue to take pressures related to strategic revenue growth and our legacy revenue declines, we remain confident in our business and our ability to improve the revenue and adjusted EBITDA trajectory over time.","Now I'll ask the operator to begin the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please proceed.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much and good afternoon folks. I was wondering if we could dive in a bit on the Consumer segment. You know, if we take a look at some of the below expected performance of that segment, how should we think about your strategy for that business going forward, clearly with the Level 3 the acquisition, there's a lot more focus and exposure to the Enterprise, are there goals that you guys are meeting or thinking about to improve the Consumer segment or should we consider this shift away from the Consumer sort of de-emphasizing that business going forward?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, Amir, first of all this is Glen. There are several things we're doing here. First of all, we continue to build on infrastructure and increase the availability of speeds. Where we have 40 megabits or more speed, we're seeing good penetration in the marketplace. The other thing we're doing, which is really we're seeing a lot of success from is simplified pricing and services offered what we call Price for Life, and we're seeing significant take rates in that. We've only rolled that out in a few of our markets this past quarter.","We just rolled out I guess about two weeks ago in a number of other markets, all of our legacy CenturyLink markets and we are rolling that out in the legacy Qwest markets. Our plan is by the end of August. We're seeing significant good take rates there, especially where the higher speed is available. So it's not giving up or turning back on the Consumer business. There's a lot of cash flow there. We have been successful in the past competing with cable. We believe we have opportunity to continue to grow that business, and I think we're going to see much better results.","We expect to see a leveling off of the losses in the third quarter. Actually expect positive unit growth in the fourth quarter of the year.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And just a follow-up, if I may, in terms of overall customer reception, I mean, as we get closer to the close of the transaction, how has the overall customer reception been to the anticipation of the close of the deal? Meaning, how should we think about potential customer churn risk and what you folks are doing to ensure that, that doesn't take place, things along those lines?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","One of the primary focus of the integration work is being sure we have as little interruption with momentum and with loss of customers as possible or loss of revenue streams due to the integration work. We are working hard to \u2013 of course, we cannot \u2013 first of all, let me say, we can't about specific customers here as far as our teams are concerned because of the limits on any type of collusion here, anti-competitive work, so we're limited right now. But that is a primary focus of our company going forward is to have our sales team ready.","We have a clean room that we have independent folks working through sales information and customer information that when we close the transaction, we'll be able to immediately work with those folks to try to appropriately address each customer opportunity. Obviously, where we have \u2013 our respective teams working with specific customers will rationalize those teams. We will pick the very best approach with those customers and let those customers even make some of those decision. But that is the primary focus, it's always difficult, but we believe we're very much prepared for that. It's not the first time we've gone through this. The only other item I mentioned there is that as we bring these companies together, we are seeing some delays by customers just waiting for companies to come together and see which \u2013 what network infrastructure we're going to utilize and the changes that the combination of these companies might offer, so we're seeing some delays.","They're not really going to other \u2013 our competitors right now, but they are delaying their decision like we believe partially because of wanting to see the companies come together.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please proceed.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question, Glen, would be kind of as a follow-up to your answer to Amir's question, kind of on delays related the Enterprise decision-making. I think last quarter you talked about how the funnel for the forward growth was about as good as you'd ever seen it maybe 2x or 3x would have been at the same time last year. I was wondering if you could talk about that funnel right now and kind of what that funnel informs you around revenue growth in Enterprise.","And then the second question I guess is my kind of usual question, which is, if I add up first quarter EBITDA and second quarter EBITDA and the midpoint of your third quarter EBITDA, and I look at your guidance from the beginning of the year minus the data centers, it implies that fourth quarter EBITDA would have to be north of $1.5 billion to get to that very low end. And if that'd be anywhere close to right, it would mean that we're starting to see improving EBITDA trends. So I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more to the key moving parts, things that have to work for that to be true and the things that definitely don't have to break for that to be true? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes. David, I'll start with \u2013 on the sales funnel issues. We had a really good sales month of June, was one of our strongest sales months in quite a while, and we feel really good about that. We are still seeing some of those delays I just mentioned earlier in decision-making, but we feel really good about the demand for the services and products we've got out there. And the future looks bright there. I'll let Dean Douglas comment. Dean will give his view of that.","Dean J. Douglas - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, so we continue to see strength in the development of our funnel and the funnel as it's going forward. In the first quarter, we had over a 50% increase in our funnel and we've seen that increase in our MRR funnel in the second quarter continue. In fact it's greater than a 60% increase in our MRR funnel for the second quarter, so continued strong opportunity identification.","And then as we have looked at the business and converted those funnel activities to sales, as Glen mentioned, we had very, very strong June performance in our business. In fact, for our high-speed bandwidth products, we had one of the strongest Junes we've had in a few years. So, very, very strong performance converting that funnel to actual sales.","With regard to EBITDA, I'll turn it over to David.","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, thank you David. I'll address the question as far as the EBITDA for the second half of the year \u2013 as far as those improvements that we're expecting. And again, it is expectations for improved EBITDA performance for both the third quarter and the fourth quarter, driven by both revenue improvements and also expense reductions.","On the revenue improvement side, you'll see a little of that really turning around the third quarter. As we're \u2013 looking and experiencing that we've kind of been running around the $50 million legacy revenue decline. It's what we ran in the second quarter. We are expecting a little bit of improvement there, but most of our improvement really in the third quarter is in the strategic revenue area; as we're looking at improvements in the MPLS Ethernet or high-bandwidth areas, we're looking for improved growth there.","Also in the VoIP area, we have a number of improvements in rolling out an improved product and looking for growth in VoIP. And as Glen mentioned in his discussion, the cloud product and our Cloud Manager Application (sic) Cloud Application Manager (32:17) continues to do well across the board. And those are really kind of the key issues on the third quarter revenues.","On the fourth quarter revenues, we really continue those trends. IT managed services, IT normally has a very strong fourth quarter. We also, at that point, look at our broadband with our plan that we're talking about as far as rolling out that product into the additional markets that that should be completed during the third quarter and we should see the results of that impacting our fourth quarter from a positive standpoint.","We also have, on the revenue side, the data integration revenues, a pretty good spike in that in the last half of the year. Again, I would say, that's one as far as from a risk standpoint we probably do have some risk there. But again, from a margin standpoint, there's very little margin associated with that revenue, so it should not really impact us as far as an adjusted EBITDA number.","On the expense side, again, as we mentioned, we are continuing to see good expense controls, particularly in the area of head count, through attrition and the management of cost there. Also Aamir and his group have done a great job of bringing our network and facility costs and trying to manage to those. And we continue to see that.","The last couple of years, we have had reductions in the fourth quarter in our expenses, part of that due to the seasonality that we typically have where we kind of cycle out of the third quarter with our overtime and some of those. We actually have a little bit of that overtime built into our third quarter expenses this year, but that will decrease in the fourth quarter along with other expense savings that we typically see in that. And I guess just the \u2013 and also just the continued head count savings that we're anticipating from the team putting together an aggressive plan to being able to control cost.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. That sounds great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. On the merger approval, can you give us any color around the timeline from here, what hearing schedules or anything, when you expect to get the last two states? And I think the FCC's \u2013 last time I looked it was still on day 170, when that might start again. And then, on the lawsuits, have there been \u2013 and we appreciate the color on that \u2013 have there been any changes to your policies or procedures in the field in the call centers since the lawsuits were filed? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, Simon. The timeline for closing the last two states, we really can't predict that. We believe they're moving along well overall. So we think we'll get those approvals in the weeks ahead. We're working diligently with them to answer any remaining questions they might have and we feel confident we'll get there. Close to DOJ, we're working with the DOJ to answer the final \u2013 hopefully, the final questions we'll have there. There's no way to predict and I'm not going to try to anticipate what that \u2013 when they'll actually get through that, but we believe that will get done successfully by the end of September. I don't have the date as far as the FCC's dates, but they're working diligently with us as well. I don't expect them to seem to be the major issue here in getting approval. I think we're moving well there. So overall, we're confident. Just the main thing is any specific issues or questions that come up at the last minute that you never know about. But we believe right now we're on track to close by the end of September.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then on the policies?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll let Maxine address the call center policies.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","Good afternoon. So no, not in particular from a call center policy change, but what we are doing is if you look at some of the compliance that you read in social media and other venues, it's around complexity of our pricing, complexity of our bill. And the things that we're doing to address that is the launch of this new simplified price, there's no hidden fees, there's no promotional pricing, no changes, no contracts.","As well as when they see their bill, it's very easy to understand and that's what we're making changes to, make it simple for the customer, make it simple for our call center agents, our field personnel so that we can explain the offers to the customers and the customers understand them and they're clear.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And is that been something that's been ongoing for a while before this all happened?","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","Absolutely. Yeah, we actually started the new pricing planning around early February and have been implementing those throughout the year. So yes, this was well in place before any of this came up.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, that's helpful. Thank you.","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two if I could. One housekeeping item first. Can you talk to how much the contract re-price for a wholesale customer that you called out? How much did that impact 2Q and is there any sort of lingering impact next quarter?","And then secondly, just going back to the \u2013 on the Consumer side. As it relates to broadband, can you maybe help us think through some of the weakness we saw this quarter, how that broke up between gross adds and churn and where you're expecting the improvements to come from in the second half? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","David, go ahead.","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, as far as the impact to the contract re-price, probably I'd prefer not to give an exact dollar amount for that. It is an ongoing. So it is basically a contract that had different pricing structures built in at certain times over the contract. So just basically implementing that new price structure during the second quarter. So that will impact us going forward. Yes, that is also part of the reason why on the third \u2013 it did impact us in the second quarter as far as our incremental change from first to second.","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","And regarding broadband for the second quarter, if you recall, last quarter, we talked about continuing to tighten up our credit standards. We have also eliminated several very low-priced offers that were in the market, as well as we removed some of our higher churn sales channels. And so those are the key things. Our churn looks really good. I think Glen mentioned that in his talking points.","Our churn was bright. We want to continue to see that churn at those levels going forward. So what you'll see in the third and fourth quarter is more of an increase in the ARPU of our customers and a stickier customer with our offers. So we're driving for customer lifetime value and overall revenue growth. You can \u2013 you know as you see from first to second quarter, while we did have a miss in our units, our units were not where we wanted them to be, our revenue was flat quarter-over-quarter.","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","This is David. Just one additional follow-up I do want to clarify on that contract re-pricing it was effective for one. So that impact is fully baked in the second quarter. So there will be no incremental impact. It would just be that pricing continuing at the same rate into the third and fourth quarter.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much for the clarification. I appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. Two, I guess, clarifications. Can you expand on the disappointing broadband growth last quarter, cable was more aggressive. I'm wondering why you'd expect cable to be any less aggressive forward \u2013 going forward?","And then second on the Enterprise side, can you clarify the sort of discussion of what the funnel of sales is, it's the funnel of actual sales or is that just you're having wider discussions than in the past? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, on the cable competition, we don't expect them to be any less. What did happen in the second quarter, we had a several key markets they rolled out their gig service and came in a very aggressive pricing. What we're doing is kind of back with our \u2013 what we're seeing success is our Price for Life product, our pricing plan and the higher speeds we've been able to roll out as we accelerated CapEx into the first half of the year and second quarter that as we just discussed.","We have a lot \u2013 we more capacity to sell into, higher speeds to offer our customers as well as a pricing plan we believe is really proven to be very successful. So we're going to be more able to compete going forward than we were in the second quarter. And Maxine, you want to?","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","And I would add to \u2013 when you're looking at our net adds, what you're not seeing in that number is the speed mix. So where we're losing customers is really on the low end like under 20 meg. But when you get to 20, 40 and above, we're seeing growth year-over-year in subscribers. And what we say is as the customers move in higher-speed tiers, we see a corresponding reduction in churn.","Even in the markets where we have gig, customers they're not buying gig. They might buy 40 meg, 100 meg even though we have 1 gig available. So from that standpoint, we'll continue to invest, as Glen mentioned, in enabling higher speeds in our footprint and competing with cable on a go-forward basis.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","With regards to clarifying the funnel versus sales, the funnel is identified opportunities. Sales are booked backlog. So that's the way you ought to be thinking about the definition. So but sale was actually an order, a real order and the funnel is the identified opportunities we see in the marketplace.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Have you seen a better conversion of that funnel to sales over the last six months as well?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Our funnel conversion has stayed about the same. We haven't seen a significant improvement or degradation in funnel conversion. What we have seen, however, is that for the MPLS market specifically, more of our midrange and some of our smaller customers are actually signing up for the MPLS services. So our conversion \u2013 I'm sorry our actual rate of revenue conversion or getting revenue from the MPLS sales is shortening as we convert those midrange customer orders into real revenues because the provisioning time is shorter and generally on that and something that we can do much more rapidly from a revenue standpoint. So that is the difference that we've seen in the second quarter.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. If I can be a pest. So as the funnel has expanded so dramatically and the conversion has been the same, at what point should we start to see a real acceleration in that sales number?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","So, we had a very strong June, as mentioned. We expect to have a very solid third quarter going forward. And so you should start to see our sales number improve as I believe was mentioned earlier. We expect that our strategic revenues also are going to improve sequentially.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please proceed.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you. On the Enterprise side, legacy revenue declined and has been accelerating. Is there anything you could point to or some improvement on that? And on the carrier re-pricing, is there a phase 3 that we should be thinking about?","Third, on the video business, as you focus on profitable customers, how should we think about the impact on Consumer ARPU and margins going forward?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Do you want to start?","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. I'll take that. First of all, Batya, on the Enterprise as far as on the legacy services, there are some things \u2013 again, if there was Enterprise only, so let me check them. One is on our fiber, I did want to make sure you notice that we rephrase the numbers, but I did want to make sure everyone did notice that on the fiber sales we have or fiber or maintenance leasing, we have moved that into the strategic. So if you're looking at prior numbers and not looking at the release, it will look out as a difference there, so please take a note of that. No change to total revenue, no change to total core revenue, but a movement from legacy to strategic.","We are also seeing declines in our private line revenue on the Enterprise side that have impacted us as far as on the legacy side. And again, we'll continue to do what we can to control that, but that's probably on Enterprise side, the main issues affecting our legacy revenue at this point. Of course, the carrier re-pricing will hit that. There is not anytime at least within the next year any further step-down as far as that. There may be further out to that, but at least within the next calendar year, I'm not aware of anything.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And on the video side?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Repeat the question, Batya, if you will.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","On the video side, can you maybe mention how many subscribers you've lost, the impact on ARPU and just trends going forward?","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, the change in revenue you're seeing on the consumer video is due to the satellite contract that we renegotiated in the first quarter. And as we talked about, you'll see that trend year-over-year. From a Prism video revenue year-over-year, we're pretty flat year-over-year.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","And in terms of subscribers, Prism subscribers?","Maxine L. Moreau - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, we don't report our Prism subscribers. What I will say, though, and I think we mentioned it last quarter, is we are doing a shift to pivot in our video approach. And we are open to offering customers multiple video options. Our Prism TV service, where it makes sense and we also resell DIRECTV, I think you're aware of, and of course, we are trialing our own over-the-top product.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And Batya, I'll just follow up. We have talked about the Prism customer, we lost about 21,000 Prism customers this year as we deemphasized that product, and because of the margin issue of the higher content cost.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Amy Yong with Macquarie. Please proceed.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. So two questions, one on Enterprise and one on cost. So on the Enterprise segment, you had mentioned that I think high-bandwidth data services and managed network services are poised to grow around mid-single and mid to upper single. And I was just wondering what you feel like the steps are needed to kind of bridge the growth, that growth and the level of growth that you're seeing right now.","And then my other question is on the cost side. I know you laid out a couple of expense reductions, but are there any one-time costs that we should be aware of related perhaps to the integration for 3Q or 4Q or areas that you're going to invest in? Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Amy, regarding the high-speed data service and managed services and with the markets \u2013 the market's in mid to high through this growth. Look at just the high-bandwidth data services excluding normalized base, they were at 5% growth rates. So we feel pretty good about that and with a few \u2013 some improvements that we have planned, the new services products that I talked about we've rolled out recently, we think we're certainly hitting that higher mid-single-digit \u2013 or mid to higher single digits in that growth rate.","So obviously managed services, we turned it around this last quarter. We think it's very doable that we'll see mid to high single-digits there as well. So we feel positive about the change we made in those services. And just one example is our Cloud Application Management services is really selling well in our Enterprise base. And our Managed Security Services in SMB space especially is really growing well. So we feel good about those services that are starting to take off at a higher level than they were previously. So we think that we can hit those growth rates.","And then with the Level 3 acquisition too, bringing these companies together, we got a broader range of products and services and we have the international piece that we didn't have before, a much broader international footprint, network footprint, which should give us some advantages that we have. And we also just to scale with the Level 3, we're the second largest domestic carrier, put us in a position to compete in a level we really didn't get to, and we'll be able to after we close this transaction.","David D. Cole - CenturyLink, Inc.","As far as on the expense reductions, no, there are no one-time step-downs related to the integration in the third and fourth quarter cost estimate that we are using. These are really other head count cost reductions and other cost reductions that we are looking, as I mentioned, on the network side. I mean, we have been, at least, particularly in the corporate areas, we've probably been not as quick to fill some of those positions with organization announcements taking place, particularly at higher level positions as we have attrition. But on the sales side, I would point out, we definitely are aggressively filling any positions we have there and we continue to focus on being fully staffed in our sales and sales support organizations going forward.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Mike McCormack with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, thanks. Maybe just a couple of things. On the Consumer broadband side, you mentioned some of the gigabit products in the marketplace taking some share. Is it really a battle on speed or is it more that you're seeing loss to a bundled offering and you also mentioned price I guess as well?","And then secondly, just on the Enterprise legacy revenue, what things can you put in place to try to stem some of those losses? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","First of all, Mike, on the Consumer broadband, it's really about speed more than bundle. (51:55) of aggressive price points than speed's what it's about. We didn't get through your \u2013 will you repeat the second question? I'm sorry, Mike.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Yes, Glen. I'm just asking about the Enterprise, the legacy Enterprise revenue, anything that you can do or strategies in place to try to stem some of those losses?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We are trying to convert as many of those customers as we possibly can. What's happening in private line, those customers are either going away or many of them are converting to higher speeds, and we're aggressively going after those customers, trying to convert them to our high-speed products. So that's a big part of what we're doing and also our new Ethernet product is really a strong offer that we believe can drive a lot of that to our \u2013 we can migrate a lot of those customers to our Ethernet product platform. So those are the things we're really moving aggressively working toward to kind of stem some of that loss on those lower speed customers.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. You mentioned earlier you're still trialing the OTT product. I know you've been working on that for a little while. I was wondering if you can maybe just give us an update on where you are, how soon you think you may bring it to market.","And then just with so many other streaming products having come to the market, do you think it's essential to have your own product in a bundle or do you think that maybe there's some opportunities to start bundling some of these other standalone offers that are out there and sort of meet the same objectives you might have through your own offering? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, Brett, first of all, we are in the process of rolling out our over-the-top product. We have some \u2013 we have \u2013 one key advantage we have with our product is a cloud DVR across multiple devices. That's really been a compelling part of our offer. We have flexible packaging including live and on-demand local broadcast, national channels, got some genre additions. But we are very open to looking at other options. We don't have \u2013 these other standalone or different partners we could have to provide over-the-top video, then we're open to that.","Matter of fact, we continually talk with some of these other providers, look at the best ways we can bring that service and also other ways in working with them to reduce our content cost. So that will be a key objective even with our over-the-top product. So yes, we're very open to that. It does not have to be our product.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Is it safe to assume that the ultimate goal here is just to lower the churn profile of your broadband subs?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","That's really a lot of it, just bring that bundle together, lower the churn and also generate additional average revenue per customer.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will now come from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Just following up, you mentioned the strength in June. Was that in sales or strength more on the revenue conversion side? And then looking ahead at some of the changes at the FCC, is there any products or anything you might do differently is that we see some changes to Title II and so forth, any strategic revenue opportunities that you see that might open up?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","First of all, Frank, on the strength in June, it was sales is where the strength was in June. It wasn't conversion ratio. It's all that we see in this, we mentioned we're shortening of intervals and \u2013 between as far as install intervals and that's helping us convert more quickly to revenue. Especially in the SMB space, we're seeing a lot of improvement there, it's driving revenue better for us. And as far as the opportunity with the FCC, we're very pleased moving away from the Title II requirements that we've been \u2013 really cloud over for a while there. Just overall improvement in the direction of FCC, in our view, of less stringent regulation. And we believe that \u2013 and on the Internet side, we think (56:30) certainly put control and protections in for consumers for Open Internet, while at the same time allowing for you competition there. So overall, we're very pleased with where we're headed with regulation. We'll see what happens. It won't all go our way, but as far as the changes we're seeing, we're very pleased, thus far, with FCC policies.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay.

As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2014 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","If you turn to Slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for full year and first quarter 2015 and other outlooks in our business.

Glen?","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Starting on Slide 5, our fourth quarter results were slightly weaker than our expectations but we are pleased with our full year 2014 performance and the progress we made toward reaching revenue stability. The weakness in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower hosting revenue growth resulting from lower installs and non-recurring revenue along with higher churn and credits. Also, we experienced accelerated decline in low bandwidth data revenue and we had a one-time true-up in employee healthcare cost that impacted the quarter. We are taking a number of actions to drive a stronger strategic revenue growth in 2015 and we\u2019ll discuss some of those with you today.","Our recent organizational realignment is expect to result in some initial negative impact on our sales momentum in the first half of 2015, but we are confident this refined operating structure positions us well to drive stronger revenue results, strategic revenue growth and operating efficiency over the long-term.","Global sales and revenue is now led by Karen Puckett, and we expect to accelerate our future revenue growth through a more unified sales and marketing approach and improved customer experience. Additionally, the alignment of our shared global network and data center infrastructure operations under a single senior leader Maxine Moreau is expected to drive increased efficiency and consistency.","We also completed two strategic acquisitions in December. We acquired a DataGardens in Cognilytics, which we believe significantly enhance our project and solutions portfolio. The DataGardens acquisition give us a leading disaster recovery as a service cloud solution, which once fully integrated with our current IT solution should provide an improved end-to-end customer experience.","Acquisition of Cognilytics positions CenturyLink as a leading provider of advanced predictive analytics and big data solutions to help mid-size and large enterprises convert data to decisions. We accomplish this through deep expertise and big data deployment, advance decision sciences and predictive analytics. CenturyLink can now deliver advanced big data analytic solutions across multiple industries including financial services, retail, consumer products, healthcare, oil and gas among others.","Also, we have an outstanding portfolio of network hosting, cloud IT and managed service capabilities. We\u2019ve integrated this broad portfolio into solutions for a diverse set of customers from the largest companies from the world to small locally focused companies.","In addition, we\u2019ve expanded our distribution capabilities and made additional investments in our product enhancements we believe will be effective in helping drive growth in the coming year.","Now turning to Slide 6, I'd like to recap our performance for 2014. During the year, we continued to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments we believe will lead to revenue stability. For the full year 2014, we generated total operating revenue of $18.03 billion, a 0.4% decline compared to 2013; it\u2019s an improvement from the 1.5% year-over-year decline in 2013 compared to 2012.","In 2014, the core revenue, strategic and legacy revenue trend also continue to improve from 1.3% annual decline in 2013 to a 0.6% annual decline in 2014. This continued revenue improvement was driven by a nearly $380 million increase in strategic revenues, primarily due to growth in high bandwidth data services high-speed Internet, Prism TV and hosting and cloud revenues.","Revenue growth from high bandwidth data services MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength was a strong 16% year-over-year. Additionally, a decline of legacy revenue slowed from 7.4% in 2013 to 6.3% in 2014. We achieved solid growth in both high-speed Internet and Prism TV subscribers throughout the year adding 91,000 and 67,000 respectively. We've been pleased with t continued growth of Prism TV subscribers in existing markets where we further expanded Prism TV service in 2014.","Throughout the year we invested to enhance our network to improve speed, availability across our footprint. One direct result of this investment is that we grew the number of enabled access lines receiving 20 megabits and 40 megabits each by more than 45% over the prior year. Additionally, we generated solid free cash flow of $2.7 billion and returned approximately $1.9 billion to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program.","Now turning to Slide 7, during 2014, we continued to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications to an integrated provider of network, cloud hosting and IT services, and we're focused on executing on several strategic priorities. We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued fast promotion of our company and driving long-term profitable growth.","The first of these is to grow business solutions. We continue to drive strong strategic growth, revenue growth from meeting businesses and government demand for our MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength network services during the year. Additionally, our Managed Office and Managed Enterprise Solutions continued to gain traction and are beginning to drive meaningful revenue growth due to increasing customer interest from both small and large business customers.","These Managed Services help free them from day-to-day management of their network services and equipment as well as maintenance. We are seeing strong demand for GPON service from businesses and expect to drive additional revenue growth from our continued expansion of GPON availability in the months ahead.","Wholesale revenues remained under pressure due to lower bandwidth data service disconnects along with reductions in intercarrier compensation and declining voice usage. We've had success mitigating our losses by expanding our fiber based wireless backhaul services; we now serve over 21,000 towers.","The key focus in 2015 will be helping our wholesale customers with their colocation and cloud requirements. Growth in our hosting services including collocation, managed hosting, cloud solutions was below our expectations. However, we believe the hosting opportunities remain strong as we improve the capability of our highly automated next generation CenturyLink cloud platform.","Price compression on colocation renewals and technology refreshes along with some increased churn driven by small group of large customers continue to pressure overall hosting revenue growth. In addition, with our focus on leaving IT capacity issue due to production workloads, we've seen a measured adoption of multi-tenant cloud based services, based on how ready the customer's application architecture is for cloud conversion. However, interest in and demand for cloud based services continues to grow. Also, our sale of colocation services reached record levels in the second half of 2014.","From the standpoint of cloud, we are focusing on opportunities that leverage our key strengths in cloud, one example of which is the ability of IT departments to set spending thresholds at the individual or department level and monitor cloud spend on a real time basis.","Although our Managed Hosting sales are not where we want them to be, we are seeing success in selling our cloud and Managed Hosting Solutions. And during the fourth quarter we added eight Fortune 500 companies as CenturyLink cloud and managed hosting customers. And finally, on direct channel, partners are beginning to sell our managed hosting solutions; we expect to additional partners in 2015.","Going on to Slide 8, in the consumer segment, we continue to see good results in those markets we've deployed higher bandwidth and IPTV services. For example, in Omaha, the results continue to be strong in the consumer market and we are seeing good results in the small, medium business space as well.","Along with our gigabit service expansion of our businesses we also announced the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in select locations at 10 cities including sine of our larger markets like Minneapolis, St. Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas and Portland. We expanded the gigabit footprint in these markets in 2014; expect to further expand availability of this service in the months ahead.","We also plan to continue to invest in our Prism TV capabilities having added approximately 385,000 addressable homes during 2014 which exceeded our full year 2014 target of 300,000 household. As of year-end, we had more than 240,000 Prism TV customers across addressable homes of 2.4 million. We anticipate expanding Prism TV service to additional households and markets during the second half of 2015; we're not ready to announce specific markets at this time.","Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiencies through a numbers of methods including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our end to end provisioning time and help to drive standardization. We continue to modernize our network by replacing ATM with IP technology that enables high broadband speeds while also adding network capacity to serve our growing customer base.","For full year 2014, we added over 4 terabytes to our IP backbone bringing total capacity now at 20 terabytes per second on that backbone. Also, we continue to manage expenses related to out declining legacy revenues and, lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IT operations to our cloud platform as we continue to invest in IT virtualization.","In recent years, we have consolidated over our internal IP operations from more than 10 data centers to 4 data centers and we are using a cloud first approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform infrastructure and software-as-as-service solution across our internal IT operations that we're selling through our cloud and IP hosting customers. This effort is expected to reduce our IT cost and improve security and other efficiencies for CenturyLink.","In summary, I believe we are well-positioned in markets with a strong portfolio of strategic assets. We've also invested in expanding our unified distribution capabilities and we have at laser focus on continuing to improve our revenue trend in the months ahead.","Now I'll turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and full year and first quarter 2015 guidance. Stewart?","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the fourth quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the full year and first quarter 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Beginning on Slide 10, I'd like to review some highlights from our fourth quarter results. I'll be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules.","Operating revenues were $4.44 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.3% decline from the fourth quarter of 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue, which is defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.05 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of 1.5% from the year ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 2.2% year-over-year and now represent 52% of our total revenues compared to 50% a year ago.","Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth. We added approximately 12,900 Prism TV customers and 18,600 high-speed Internet customers during the fourth quarter.","We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.71 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.5%. The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin was primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and product line revenue and an accounting adjustment of about $40 million related to employee healthcare cost offset by one-time reductions in facility cost and operating taxes totaling $30 million recorded. Additionally, we generated $373 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures along with other income.","Our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter was $0.60. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedule.","These special items included two larger items worth calling out in the fourth quarter, a $60 million favorable income tax adjustment and an approximate $60 million pension settlement charge as a result in a partial termination of a plan.","Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program we repurchased 2.3 million shares for an investment of $91 million during fourth quarter. We expect to continue to be optimistic in completing this program within the 24-month period.","Now turning to Slide 11, fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues declined $104 million or 2.3% compared to fourth quarter a year ago as the growth in strategic revenues was more than offset by the decline in legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use and lower data integration revenues. The growth in our strategic revenues was primarily driven by strength in high-speed Internet, high bandwidth business data services and Prism TV. Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the revenue decline in fourth quarter 2014 was 16% lower than the fourth quarter revenue decline a year ago.","Moving to Slide 12, as outlined in our earnings release, beginning with the fourth quarter reporting, we've changed our segment reporting to align with our new organization structure. We will now report two segments: Business and Consumer. The Business segment consists primarily of providing network, IT services, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services to enterprise, wholesale and governmental customers across the U.S. and select international locations.","The consumer segment consists primarily of providing products and services to residential consumers across our 37-state footprint and remains relatively unchanged from prior reporting. Schedules providing eight quarter trended detail of these new segments are provided in the earnings supplement which is available on our investor relations website.","Now turning to our Business segment. In fourth quarter, the business segment generated $2.7 billion in operating revenues which decreased $102 million or 3.6% from the same period a year ago. Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 0.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth quarter year ago driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength which was largely offset by the continued decline of low bandwidth data services and a one-time true-up related to strategic revenues of approximately $10 million in the quarter.","We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer growth market and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium size business space to provide improved market share and drive further growth.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.4% from fourth quarter 2013 due primarily to continued decline in access lines.","Total business segment expenses increased slightly from the year ago period driven primarily by higher sales related expenses. Our segment margin was 43.6%, a decline from 46% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the higher cost I just mentioned above along with the continued decline in business segment legacy and low bandwidth data services revenue.","On Slide 13, I\u2019ll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the business segment. High bandwidth data services revenue grew 13% year-over-year compared to fourth quarter of 2013 driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and governmental customers. Low bandwidth data services including private line continued to decline in fourth quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of 13% was primarily due to continued disconnects of TDM circuits by enterprise and wireless customers as they migrate to fiber-based services.","In the fourth quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $40 million or 23% compared to fourth quarter 2013 driven by lower CPE sales. If you remember fourth quarter in 2013, we actually had one sale to a large customer that makes up most of that difference.","Now turning to Slide 14, Consumer generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues which was basically flat from fourth quarter 2013. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.4% year-over-year to $727 million driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers price increases, improved churn and certain favorable revenue settlements in the current quarter.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 5.7% for fourth quarter 2013 as access line and long distant revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. The comparable year-over-year decline in fourth quarter 2013 was 8.5%.","Operating expenses increased slightly compared to the same period a year ago primarily driven by higher Prism TV content cost.","Now turning to Slide 15 and our full year and first quarter 2015 guidance, for full year 2015, we anticipate total operating revenues of $17.9 billion to $18.1 billion and core revenues of $16.25 billion to $16.45 billion, both stable when compared to full year 2014 due to expected continued increases in the level of strategic revenue growth offsetting the anticipated legacy revenue declines.","Operating cash flow is expected to range from $6.8 billion to $7 billion and free cash flow is expected to range from $2.5 billion to $2.7 billion. Operating cash flow and free cash flow are expected to decline for full year 2014 primarily driven by the continued decline in higher margin legacy revenues, the impact of higher expenses associated with the increased growth in strategic revenues and an increase in pension expense of approximately $90 million due to changes in actuarial assumptions which really relate to our adoption of new mortality tables.","We anticipate a decline in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $250 million for full year 2015 compared to full year 2014 primarily driven by the impact of declining amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and the annual review and update of deprecation rates which were expected to more than offset increases in depreciation expense associated with continued capital investment.","Included into the full year free cash flow estimate are cash taxes of $25 million to $50 million. As a result of bonus deprecation being approved our cash taxes will now be less than we anticipated earlier. We also expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $3 billion in 2015 and adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $2.50 to $2.70.","Currently, we have not yet decided whether to accept or reject the specific build-out opportunities related to support payments available under CAP II. We plan to provide an update later this year when it is determined the extent to which the implementation of CAP II will impact our future revenues and cash flows.","For first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.45 billion to $4.5 billion, an increase compared to fourth quarter 2014, primarily due to projected growth in strategic revenue offsetting the anticipated decline in legacy revenue resulting in higher core revenue and also higher data integration revenues in first quarter 2015.","Core revenues are expected to range from $4.04 billion to $4.09 billion. Operating cash flow is projected to be between $1.64 billion to $1.69 billion, a decrease compared to fourth quarter 2014 primarily due to higher pension cost, payroll taxes and operating taxes along with the continued decline in higher margin legacy revenue.","We also anticipate an approximate $90 million decline in depreciation and amortization expense in the first quarter of 2015 compared to fourth quarter of 2014 driven by the reasons previously described. The anticipated lower level of depreciation and amortization expense is expected mostly offset the decrease in operating cash flow and the impact of favorable income tax adjustments in fourth quarter 2014 resulting in adjusted diluted EPS expected to range from $0.56 to $0.61 per share in first quarter 2015 compared to the $0.60 in fourth quarter 2014.","That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I\u2019ll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Barden","Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess my first question is, Stewart, if you could kind of go back and kind of catalog in one list some of these one-timers from the fourth quarter, I think you normalized some out in your EBITDA number but you didn\u2019t normalize some other ones out which I guess were a $40 million one-time expense offset by $30 million in one-time benefits; there was I think you said there were some positive revenue settlements in the consumer segment in the quarter. If you could kind of walk us through that so we could kind of get sense is to what kind of earnings power the company was in the fourth quarter.","And then the second part on the guidance I guess, Glen, you kind of foreshadow that the shape of 2015 would be a little stronger in revenue in the second half than the first half as a result of some of the reorganization issues, but looking at the first quarter revenue guidance its up sequentially, it's actually flat year-over-year to midpoint. So I was wondering could you kind of give us a sense to how much of the expectation for revenue stability, do you kind of have in hand right now that you see in your books and your funnels, and then what increment is coming from the hopped four benefits that will be in the back-end of this reorg? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so David, in terms of the fourth quarter items that were more or less one-time items, we did have a $40 million true-up related to group insurance that was an increase in expense that was basically offset by $30 million of favorable adjustments that we had; we had about a $15 million favorable adjustment for related to operating taxes which were primarily property taxes, and then $15 million related to facilities cost. That was a favorable adjustment that\u2019s a one-time adjustment. So really net-net about $10 million negative expense in the fourth quarter that would be one-time adjustments. ","And on the revenue side, basically, there were just a couple of offsetting items there. In business revenue on the strategic side, we had a $10 million negative adjustment that I mentioned. That was related to a large customer that we have that we needed to book the revenue differently than the way -- basically it needed to be accounted for differently based on the contract. So we had a $10 million negative adjustment there on the business segment or strategic revenue. We also had a positive settlement that I mentioned as well of about that $10 million that impacted consumer revenue on the strategic side, and that was basically related to the couple of settlements that we had with parties that we sell products for.","David Barden","Got it.","Glen Post","Yes, David, regarding the revenue and first half or second half you are right. We do expect more growth in second half of the year. We think we\u2019ll some mild disruption due to this reorganization; we are changing sales plan, we\u2019re changing really sales leadership for certain accounts across the country. So there would be some disruption there.","Our funnel is good right now; we have a really good funnel. Also, we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand for combined solutions that we are selling. As I mentioned, we saw some big deals with some Fortune 500 companies, we're selling in small mid-size space we\u2019re seeing a lot of demand for our managed office product. So we\u2019re confident we\u2019re going to see increasing demand in the second half of the year and, yes, we are up in the first quarter but we expect we need more acceleration to hit that revenue stability that we expect into the second half of the year. So that\u2019s what we believe going to happen; we believe we have plans in place to make that happen including the expanded distribution along with the unified approach combining our cloud hosting and network sales teams and leadership.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, and David, the first quarter guidance for revenue is a sequential increase from fourth quarter to first quarter.","David Barden","Right. And thank you, guys, and if I could ask one quick follow-up, Stewart, again, it sounded like you're baking in the EBITDA guidance, you're baking in $90 million of incremental pension pressure related to assumption. Is it fair to say that if interest rates start to go back up that we kind of get that back over the course of the year?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so David, that\u2019s baked into the EBIDA assumption, but it\u2019s really a non-cash charge. It's just completely related to an increased or a change in the mortality tables, adopting newer mortality tables that reflect people living longer. Basically, with what\u2019s -- we'd actually merged our three pension plans in the fourth quarter and we are funded at about 84% or so, and we actually had no required pension contributions at all from a cash standpoint for the next three to five years based especially where we look at today. I mean we had a good \u2013 a good year; our pension assets are and about 12% or so, 12% to 14% in that range and -- but basically our liability went up a little over about a $1.2 billion basically due to $1 billion of it related to the change in the mortality tables, about a $1.2 billion related to a lower discount rate; we're using a discount rate of 3.9% versus about 4.9% a year ago, and then we had a little over a $1 billion of earnings.","So we feel good about where we are with respect to the plans but that $90 million incremental pension pressure is really a non-cash expense.","David Barden","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open; please go ahead.","Batya Levi","Great, thank you. Couple of questions. First, can you a little bit more color on the slowdown in the hosting revenue growth, maybe if you could quantify the churn on what you expect for churn to be in that segment for 2015? And you had mentioned before that cross-selling is a big opportunity. Do we still have that as an upside for that segment? And second question I had sort of lot of M&A activity in the space and maybe if you could remind us your thoughts on further asset purchases as data centers and space that you want to get bigger and what are some of the criteria that you would consider? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","So Batya, I'll take the first one and let Glen take the second one. Basically, in terms of the churn, the slowdown in hosting, I mean we continue to have bankruptcies hit us from the standpoint of some of the customers in our facilities and some customer credits really related to some new services that we\u2019ve had. So basically, I mean we think we can really get that work through, and from a co-location standpoint, we actually had really good quarter from the standpoint of new sales. And we have a lot of optimism in terms of our ability to be able to sell the colo space and with the developments that we are making to our cloud product that was part of the tier-3 acquisition, we\u2019re confident in our ability to be able to get that product where we can, as Glen mentioned, we picked up five Fortune 100 Fortune 500 companies and so we had a lot of confidence in our ability to able to add to that.","It certainly is not up to expectation it's not up to where we wanted to be, but we think with the changes that we\u2019ve made in the selling organization will a more sellers selling those products and service now over time we\u2019ll see improvement in the revenue associated with those businesses.","Glen Post","Batya, regarding the cross-selling, we're bring our sales teams together; so we hope there\u2019s more and more common knowledge. We do a lot of training with those folks. We will have centers of expertise for both network and cloud and hosting, but we think we opportunity to bring to those together and sell a solution of cloud and network is really a strong potential upside force. We were talking with a customer this week who we just talked with; executive talked with it really was interested in enabling the hybrid cloud offering with our cloud hosting and network capability end-to-end type capabilities. So believe that the opportunity is really strong there bringing those together.","Stewart Ewing","Batya, there were two other one-time items I'd like to mention. We had lower non-recurring revenue bookings of about $2 million in the quarter on related to hosting and also we had foreign currency impact that was negative of about $1.2 million. So we had about $3.2 million of more or less one-time items that were negative in the quarter.","Glen Post","And then, Batya, regarding the further asset purchases we might be interested in, we have a similar strong set of assets that believe are aligned with the growth opportunities in our industry.","As we've discussed the majority of our strategic products and services are growing well and moving us toward revenue stability. That being said, we are obvious of where all the consolidation is going on in the industry. We think there will be opportunities for additional assets, purchases that could enhance our growth. Our preference, as I've said before, is for inorganic growth or opportunities that really fit well with our strategic priorities that create unique value for our customers, the differentiation, and that's what we've done with the last two acquisitions which also give us some capabilities that others don't have and opportunities that can enhance our revenue and cash flow trajectory. We like to see that growth accelerate and not try to avoid situation will really pull our growth down and that should be a major view.","We will consider opportunities that would expand our network capabilities, would increase our metro fiber access footprint. Those are types of assets we'd be interested in looking at overtime and\/or investments would enhance our data hosting and cloud and IT service capabilities. So we will -- with each of those opportunities of course we will continue our pretty disciplined approach to these acquisitions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Phil Cusick","I guess, first, if you can talk about your broadband speed upgrade plan. The SEC has raised the broadband definition to 25 meg how does that affect your thoughts and any thoughts on cash?","Glen Post","First of all, I'll let Karen address that, Phil. I'd like to say that the new definition of broadband doesn't really impact us in a significant way. We're going to find our customers with much broadband as we think we can afford in what and the needs that they have. Again we're selling solutions not just speed so we'll continue to do that. It will change how we define broadband probably going forward but it won't impact necessarily our investment in broadband. I'll let Karen talk about upgrade plan.","Stewart Ewing","Phil, the other thing I might mention is there are new broadband speed upgrade plan. It really doesn't affect CAF-II because CAF-II is 10 meg down and 1 meg up so, so it's a lot lower than the new speed that they just announced. Now I'll let Karen talk.","Karen Puckett","I don't think there is much more to add there. I would just say in terms of the broadband speed. We've been talking over many other calls about the importance of GPON and our commitment to continue to get that cost structure down, cost per household down. We continue on with our consumer GPON that we've been talking about that\u2019s the 10 markets good response. We like the halo effect that's just in new markets and then the business GPON equally important.","So the fiber-to-the-node is still an important DOCSIS still very important technology. And when you carry that have fiber sets of markets with like first step of density you need all the technology plan for that.","Phil Cusick","Okay. And then second, can you just expand quickly for me on the realignment of the business and how that is going to slow things down, it doesn't look like 1Q you're looking for a whole lot of slowdown. Should we look for a sort of weaker middle of the year and then some acceleration in the back half?","Karen Puckett","Yes, so let me just kind of walk through that just quickly in terms of this is in a business segment and we have two segments that were sub-segmenting in going to market, we have a global segment which are 1,000 employees and more and then an enterprise less than 1,000. The enterprise segment is pretty much not impacted here. There is some changes. But the real integration of the former BSD, business solutions sellers which came from the network communication side of the company, and the CTS sellers they're in the global space, and that's where the integration is happening.","And it really is working through customer portfolios. We've been very thoughtful about how we build customer modules, very thoughtful about, as Glen said, the product specialists that are important behind these sales executives and from there build the modules.","So there is module changes, there is compensation changes, we really want sellers hunting more, and we're incenting them to do that. So it's just a transition to new comp structure and some new changes in customer portfolio. The sales we're hoping will be flat, but we're saying that we could be down a bit on first quarter which will impact us further quarters out.","But I will tell you that across the board you talk to one of our global sellers they will say this is the right thing to do. We really needed that one stays to the customer and get the technical support behind that. So it's been embraced by changes always hard for an organization in particular sellers.","Phil Cusick","Does this create an opportunity to accelerate the EBITDA or the cost cutting?","Karen Puckett","You sound like, Stewart, now we'll take every opportunity. We do think obviously there are some attrition fees. We got to get the revenue trajectory the sell trajectory going for us. There are some attrition fees because you have more coverage right. You have better coverage with potentially you have less headcount. So the answer is yes, we got to let that all play through.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank Louthan","What's the internal virtualization of your IT systems? How long you've been working on that and what sort of cost savings can you expect to see materialize and we've been talking for a little bit, for a while, about the larger customer churn and the hosting in co-lo business, what point do you expect to see that stabilize may be see a little bit better growth out of that business?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, Frank. First of all virtualized IT systems I don't have a number to give you I haven't really disclosed that figure. But we're anticipating especially control significant ability to control our cost going forward. We're going to reduce cost initially, but we're taking all of our serve based systems, our non-mainframe systems, and moving them as we speak to our cloud. And we are closing data centers; we're reducing headcount in those areas. We are able to often do a lot of automation there and it is we think that the opportunities are significant to -- and as I said, not just reduce its current cost, but control cost going forward with this virtualization. So we're very confident in it and we are -- we believe we have -- we don't drink own bath water here, we don't do it ourselves, we think that the opportunities are really significant.","Karen Puckett","Frank, this is Karen. In terms of the co-location churn, the CTS organization have put in some changes towards the end of last year around compensation and contract, terms of contract that will have a benefit for us in 2015. We've targeted that churn to come down, we know that customers who are coming out of contract and it really is getting the right churn initiative programs in place to support that.","So the -- the fourth quarter we had a large customer that wasn't with us long to churn on it and those are the kinds of profile we just have to make sure we have the right profile mix of types of customers and I think you'll see that continue to prove here in 2015.","Frank Louthan","What may be are you going to do differently to keep a customer that would come in and out that quickly on you?","Karen Puckett","Well we probably not enabled them in the first place, we start there. If it's just in terms of the risk of the customer, I think we're reassessing the types of risk of customers. So we're going to start on the front-end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Stewart, maybe just a quick comment looking at the core revenue. Just looks on papers though unless they're going to be a significant or meaningful deceleration in strategic services that you're looking for, sort of continued steady losses on legacy side. I'm just trying to get a sense of what the thought process is there? And then, secondly, the broadband net adds, can you just give us a sense whether you're seeing gross adds coming in or better churn, and how do we think about sort of the intake on broadband? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so Mike, on the core revenues, we believe we've bottomed out in terms of the decline of those revenues and hopefully we'll see continue to see lower declines with the exception of the low speed data services and we're hopeful that we're getting to the point there to where we've worked through most of the clients where had large customers, group networks, and see the effects of towers that we didn't get the fiber-to-the-tower. So we're hopeful that that will decline somewhat during 2015 in terms of the rate of the decline that we've been seeing.","And from a strategic revenue standpoint I think the things that Karen has done with respect to the reorganization and the way our -- sales force is focused now the fact that we'll have an increased number of sellers on the street. I think we can drive the strategic products and services. I mean we've proven our ability to sell to the large MPLS networks and I think we just need to continue to focus on doing that and get some big deals in 2015 just like we did in 2014.","Karen Puckett","In terms of broadband, it really -- its not a churn issue for us in fact, we've done very well on the churn initiatives that we've had in place for over a year. It really is on the inward side and the inwards are really where we have the lower speed less dense markets or the ATM markets and our growth markets where we have fiber-to-the-node, GPON, higher speeds, where we've got the closure coming in. But its more challenging in those less dense markets where we don't have to see frankly is the inward issue there.","Mike McCormack","And Karen, you'd mentioned I guess price increases in the consumer side having a positive effect on revenue, where will you be able to take price on that, was it purely inside the Prism markets or can you take price elsewhere?","Karen Puckett","The price increases in Prism market are the faster the content cost. We are -- we have a pretty good methodology that we've used over the years in terms of kind of the lifecycle of products and price increases. And so we're just falling to kind of our process there, but you will see continued price increases in the different categories of -- really access lines in other places Prism as for the content cost.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman","I actually want to go back and understand a little more about the low bandwidth data services. You mentioned that you're hoping the headwinds to moderate a little bit this year, what's left in that category, who are the key customers, what are the services they're buying and why do you think it should moderate and just in general putting aside the tower part, when that business churns off how much of it are you typically winning back to other services and to what extent just some of it just kind of go away?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so basically the customers there are the large telecommunications customers for the most part that's where the most of the revenue is. Again we believe we'll have some moderation this year in terms of the churn that we've seen in the network grooming and the copper to the towers that we've had that we've lost. And basically we think we haven't really shared the amount of revenue in that bucket. But suffice to say it should come down in terms of the numbers of losses that we see in 2015.","Brett Feldman","And when you lose it, do you tend to just lose it, or are you getting it back somewhere else?","Stewart Ewing","Some of it we get back. So basically it goes to -- I think Ethernet service, and so basically our Ethernet revenues are cannibalizing the copper based revenues that we have. So there is some decline in revenue there and it typically takes a few years before the circuits get back to the point where you overcome the loss that you had in the copper circuit. So it requires a bandwidth increase over the Ethernet circuits over time in order to be able to achieve the same amount of revenue that we're effectively we're getting from the copper circuit.","Brett Feldman","Great. And just you mentioned the cash taxes for the year; I just didn\u2019t quite get it, could you just repeat that again?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so that $25 million to $50 million, which is lower than what we had previously been stating because of the fact that almost depreciation was inactive.","Brett Feldman","So what happens the next year, does that inflect higher or is everything get pushed out another year?","Stewart Ewing","Yes, it does. So 2016 our cash taxes would be $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of which about $300 million of that are really taxes that relate to 2015, but because of the way that we can make our tax payment the cash doesn't go out the door for the big part of 2015 until 2016.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Spencer Gantsoudes","Hi, this is Spencer for Simon. Two quick questions. So first the buyback slowed pretty meaningful in the second half and there was like quarter-over-quarter should we -- that's just a function of the higher stock price and should we expect that to be down somewhat this year? And then secondly, back in 2013, you mentioned expecting a similar inflection in the revenue for the second half of the year. Can you talk about how your expectations for this year are similar may be different from that? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Yes, so in terms of the buyback we've spent little over $90 million in the quarter. We actually spent about $75 million in the month of January. So our -- the amount of money that we spend every day, the cash we spend every day is based on a matrix that we have under our 10b5-1 plan. And so we still expect to complete that program that $1 million program within the 24-month period from the time that we started that program which effectively was the end of May of 2014. So basically by the end of May of 2016, we would still expect to be complete that program.","Glen Post","Spencer, would you repeat the last part of your question, the last question?","Spencer Gantsoudes","Yes, sure. I think you guys had made comments previously about expecting acceleration for 2013 I think it was most because of the data hosting business but I was wondering if there is any analogue we can draw for this year in terms of your expectations are similar, acceleration for revenues at the back half?","Glen Post","Well it\u2019s a combination of revenue growth I think and -- all across the strategic revenue. But it's -- the reason we believe that or confident that is that first of all we have increased our sales force, our distribution both direct, and in-direct. We realigned our sales force we talked about previously under Karen, combining our cloud and host again with network. We believe we're remaining underpenetrated in strategic products and services MPLS and Ethernet, we believe we're well positioned really take share back in these areas. Also we've invested this voice technology with SIP trunking features that give us more capability we believe.","We -- and although as you mentioned our cloud and host results are not -- met our expectations to-date. The fact is demand for these services is still great and we are -- we believe we are making the right investments in these platforms especially in great automation of our cloud platform that we are rolling out of our Q3 acquisition. Together with a greater sales efficiencies, we expect that we can see -- we're going to see -- these the growth in our hosting cloud and colo sale this year.","And then our recent acquisition, I mentioned, IP and big analytic services give us -- another significant product to combine these -- with our solution selling we believe can be effective.","So we believe our results will ramp up during the course of the year and we know our plan is ambitious but we believe it's achievable.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session for today.","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. We are pleased with our solid 2014 operating and financial results and the continued improvement in our revenue trend. While we did experience slightly weaker results in the fourth quarter, we believe the reorganization and the investments we're making continue to position us to effectively compete in the marketplace and drive revenue growth from our strategic products and service in the month and years ahead. And we look forward to talking with you again soon. Thank you for joining our call today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

Your host for today's call is Glen Post, CenturyLink's Chief Executive Officer. Joining Glen on today's call are Sunit Patel, CenturyLink's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Jeff Storey, CenturyLink's President and Chief Operating Officer.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay and webcast replay through July 31, 2018. Anyone listening to a telephone or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of today, May 9, 2018, and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","And now I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining our call to discuss CenturyLink's first quarter 2018 results, our progress of integration of CenturyLink and Level 3, and our outlooks in our business.","Following my brief remarks today, Sunit will review our first quarter 2018 results with you in more detail and discuss our 2018 business outlook. Following Sunit, Jeff will provide an operations review of our business, including updates on the integration and alignment to-date of our operations, and briefly discuss opportunities and challenges he sees in the months ahead for our business.","I'm pleased with the solid results we achieved in first quarter 2018, the first full quarter of combined operations, and we are already seeing the benefits and the promise of the Level 3 acquisition. We're off to a good start in achieving the capital and operating expense synergies associated with this acquisition, which is reflected in the strong adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow results for the quarter.","We are now solidly positioned as one of the world's leading networking companies, and we are seeing increasing opportunities to drive growth. Our greater network scale and enhanced product and service portfolio are creating greater opportunities to provide communication solutions for businesses across the country and internationally, as well as in the consumer markets that we serve.","Today, I am as optimistic about the future of CenturyLink as I've been in a long time. As previously announced, I will be retiring at the end of this month, so this is my last call as CEO of CenturyLink. As you might expect, having been with CenturyLink for more than 40 years and having served as CEO for over 26 years, this is certainly a bittersweet time for me.","As I look back over those 26-plus years, I'm grateful for the great opportunities we've been blessed with as a company. I'm pleased with the growth we've achieved and especially the services we provided the businesses and Consumer customers, that have improved their lives and made their businesses stronger and more competitive.","I want to truly thank our employees who worked so hard and tirelessly to serve our customers and grow our company during my time as CEO here.","As you know, upon my retirement, Jeff Storey will become CEO of CenturyLink. I've had the opportunity to work closely with Jeff over the last couple of years, and I am very confident that Jeff is the right person to lead CenturyLink into its next chapter. He is extremely capable. And he is dedicated to growing CenturyLink in the months and years ahead. And Jeff is really just a good person who is ready to lead this company.","Finally, I want to express my sincere appreciation to you, the investment community, for your support of and interest in CenturyLink over the years.","And now I'll turn the call over to Sunit to review our first quarter 2018 results and discuss our 2018 business outlook. Sunit?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Glen, and good evening, everyone. We started 2018 with a good quarter. And we are making steady progress on capturing annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies.","I'll start on Slide 5 of our first quarter earnings presentation. We reiterated our full year 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.18 billion. We generated free cash flow of $941 million. And we achieved approximately $215 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the Level 3 transaction. This compares to $75 million as of the end of the fourth quarter 2017.","Turning to Slide 6. Total revenue in the first quarter declined 1.7% to $5.945 billion, with declines of 1% in Business revenue and 4.7% in Consumer revenue.","As of January 1, 2018, the company prospectively adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. Overall, the adoption of this new standard negatively affected total revenue by approximately $15 million in the quarter, with $10 million in Consumer and $5 million in Business.","Within Business, the Enterprise group was negatively affected by approximately $11 million, slightly offset by a benefit to Medium and Small Business revenues for $4 million. Our Wholesale and Indirect and our International and Global Accounts groups were affected minimally.","Additionally, from a sales standpoint, and as we mentioned on last quarter's call, we had seen some softness while we were merging the sales teams together at the end of 2017. While we continue to have a bit of a slow start in January and February, we had strong sales performance in March, which will benefit us later this year.","Business revenue declined 1% to $4.383 billion. Within Business, revenue from our Enterprise group increased 1.8%. Our performance this quarter was generally affected by slower sales and the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard. Excluding the effects of this revenue recognition standard, Enterprise revenue grew 2.6% in the first quarter 2018.","Wholesale and Indirect revenue decreased 5.5%. Within the group, Wholesale decreased 7.4%. Keep in mind that the legacy Level 3 wholesale voice services, or WVS, revenue is now included in Wholesale and Indirect. Overall, we expect that performance to improve. Indirect revenue increased 7.7%.","International and Global Accounts revenue increased 5.2%. Within the group, Global Accounts revenue increased 4.2% and International revenue grew 6.1%.","Our Medium and Small Business revenue decreased 4.6%. While we continue to manage through declines in our legacy services, we currently have several initiatives in place to drive growth in this business unit.","Consumer revenue declined 4.7% in the first quarter 2018. This compares to a year-over-year decline of 5.7% we reported last quarter.","Overall, we're doing well in transitioning customers to higher-speed solutions and continue to see success with our simplified customer-friendly Price for Life offering.","Within Consumer, we saw a net loss of about 58,000 broadband subscribers this quarter, compared to a loss of approximately 90,000 subscribers last quarter. This quarter's total was made up of losses of about 112,000 at speeds under 20-meg and gains of approximately 54,000 in the high-speed offerings. In addition, with our Price for Life offering, we are seeing higher ARPUs.","Moving to revenue results by product group on slide 7. Transport and infrastructure grew 1.2%, led by revenue growth in wavelengths of 8.4% and dark fiber of 5.6%, offset by a revenue decline of 13% in private line. IP and data services increased 1.4%, driven by VPN growth of 2.7% and CDN growth of 27%.","Voice and collaboration services declined 9.7%. Within voice and collaboration, VoIP grew 20% and was offset by a 10% decline in voice revenue. IT and managed services increased 5.9%.","I'd like to take a moment and discuss SD-WAN. We're excited about our SD-WAN offering and optimistic about the long-term potential. In the quarter, our SD-WAN revenue grew 45%, but represented less than 1% of total revenue.","Meanwhile, as I mentioned, revenue from our VPN product, often referred to as MPLS, grew nearly 3% in the quarter. From what we are seeing in our sales funnel, customers who are interested in SD-WAN are generally asking for both SD-WAN and VPN in their requirements. We view these products are complementary.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on slide 8. For the first quarter 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $2.181 billion, compared to $2.181 billion from the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $30 million lower, due to $20 million in one-time credits we discussed last quarter for the fourth quarter, combined with an increase in payroll taxes and other compensation expense items of approximately $40 million in the first quarter of 2018, all of which were partially offset by synergy savings.","Integration-related expenses incurred in the first quarter 2018 totaled approximately $71 million, of which $65 million impacted adjusted EBITDA. Additionally, in the first quarter, we took an impairment charge of $42 million as we exited the consumer over-the-top video or OTT business. Our decision to discontinue the OTT business was a result of our focus on profitable revenue.","Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 36.7% for the first quarter 2018, compared to 36.0% in the year-ago quarter. In general, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand nicely.","For the first quarter 2018, capital expenditures were $805 million. This includes $17 million of integration-related capital expenditures and compares to $15 million for the fourth quarter 2017.","Over the last few months, we have taken a closer look at our capital decision-making processes and have put in place new commercial guidelines to ensure we are focused on profitable sales and growth opportunities.","For the remainder of the year, we expect high investment for the CAF or Connect America Fund, integration-related and success-based capital projects. Overall, we continue to expect to spend approximately 16% of total revenue on capital expenditures.","As a reminder, we are defining free cash flow as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. In the first quarter, the company generated free cash flow of $941 million. Additionally, in April, we received an expected income tax refund of $314 million related to our 2017 taxes. That refund flows through working capital and will benefit free cash flow results in the second quarter of 2018. Overall, we remain highly confident in our free cash flow outlook for the (14:33).","We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.3 times. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4 times, driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA.","The effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 51% due to the effect of tax reform and purchase price accounting adjustments we made in the quarter. We expect our tax rate to be lower in subsequent quarters. Overall, we continue to expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25% for the full-year 2018.","Moving to synergies on slide 9. We have achieved a total of approximately $215 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the Level 3 transaction closed. This compared to $75 million at the end of the fourth quarter 2017.","We remain confident in our ability to capture the majority of the targeted $850 million run rate adjusted EBITDA savings or synergies over the next three years. Additionally, we continue to expect to achieve the $125 million of CapEx synergies in 2018.","Turning to the business outlook on slide 10. We remain confident in our performance for the remainder of the year, and we are reiterating our 2018 financial outlook. Based on refinements to our purchase price accounting, we have lowered our depreciation and amortization outlook to a range of $5.1 billion to $5.3 billion, compared to our previous outlook of $5.4 billion to $5.5 billion. All other outlook measures remain unchanged and are listed on this slide.","I'll summarize by saying we had a good start to the year. We remain confident in our financial performance for the remainder of the year and feel good about the progress we are making in achieving synergies as we integrate.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Sunit, and thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today. Last week, we crossed the six-month mark since the close of the Level 3 acquisition. I'm pleased with the progress we are making with the integration. Whether rationalizing our product set, enhancing our customer experience, or capturing the synergies we expected, we're making steady progress.","Our results of $215 million in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies demonstrates the effectiveness of the integration effort and the discipline we use to manage the company. I'm highly confident in our ability to achieve the synergy targets we set when we announced the acquisition.","As we look at our Business segment, the first six months have reinforced our confidence in our products and capabilities and the value they bring to the market. The first six months have also reinforced our decision to move quickly in implementing the sales structure and processes we wanted to follow.","Before the close, both companies talked about delays in selling, as customers were waiting to see how the integration was going and how the sales force would be structured to support them.","Since the close, the integration and sales teams have worked diligently to develop and implement that structure, assign accounts and communicate changes to our customers. Most of these initiatives were completed in early January. After the slow start that Sunit mentioned, we've seen improving sales performance and a strengthening funnel for our Business customers.","Customers realize that we meet their wireline networking needs and that our focus on developing solutions to solve their communications challenges is unique and valuable. The combination of Level 3's global network assets, our dense CenturyLink footprint and our willingness to invest in our customers continues to create new opportunities with mid to large enterprise customers.","Similarly, the availability of more on-net buildings, combined with our sales force and sales methodologies that are aimed at small and medium businesses, is expanding our opportunity with smaller customers or branch offices of our larger customers.","In addition, we are increasing our sales efforts with small and medium businesses, both through additional call center sales people and front-line outside sales people. Through ongoing improvements to the digital environment, we're making it easier for these customers to buy and install services.","With the combination of the two companies, the proposition for our global customers is particularly powerful. Our global network assets, combined with our capabilities for hybrid networking and security, enable a strong proposition for our customers' continued migration to the cloud and the hybrid cloud environment.","Turning to Consumer. This segment represents approximately 25% of our total revenue. We value our Consumer customers and our focus on going to market with profitable products and services and the market-leading customer experience.","Last year, we announced we were deemphasizing our Prism TV service and have since made the decision to stop actively marketing it altogether. In the first quarter, we also shut down our over-the-top video product.","We strongly believe in over-the-top solutions, but also believe our role is to leverage our network capabilities to deliver other companies' content to consumers, not necessarily purchase that content and directly market it ourselves.","Whether utilizing our CDN services to distribute traffic globally for our large content customers or utilizing our high-speed IP services to deliver content directly to consumers, we will continue to play a valuable and profitable role in over-the-top.","As we look at our Consumer customers, we know that we are more successful when we can provide higher speeds, a simpler experience and move the customer to a more digital environment. We are working in making progress across all three of these dimensions.","As you saw this quarter, while we did see losses in lower speed broadband units, we grew connections for speeds at 20 megabits per second and above. We are spending capital where we can profitably expand our addressable footprint for high-speed services, and we are focusing our sales team to sell where we have those services available.","The rationalization of our products, for example, Prism TV and over-the-top solutions, and the replacement of very complex pricing and promotional plans with our much simpler Price for Life offering are examples of our efforts to simplify our interactions and enhance the customer experience for Consumer customers.","In addition to the integration comments I've already made, I'd like to highlight a few other initiatives. From a product perspective, we have completed the go-forward product roadmap and are focused, first, on a unified offer for our highest performing products, specifically Ethernet services and waves. Our unified offer will enable us to sell these services to our more than 100,000 buildings globally, including the support of key capabilities that our customers require.","We have also placed a great deal of attention on combining and enhancing our cloud services. As part of this effort, we've enhanced our software-defined managed services platform for hybrid cloud environment, called Cloud Application Manager to improve the user experience and to provide extensive cloud analytic capabilities. We've also continued to grow our cloud connect platform and can serve our customers' global connectivity needs with SDN-enabled dynamic capacity.","Another area where we continue to make integration progress is migrating traffic from off-net to on-net. As I mentioned before, bringing customers on-net provide several benefits to the customers. Not only does it reduce CenturyLink expenses, it also provides a better experience for our customers, as we control their networks from end-to-end.","Our disciplined process for moving traffic on-net is a key part of our integration plan. As our approach is very customer-centric and designed to avoid disruption, we expect this to take several years.","As Sunit noted, capital expenditures were a little light this quarter, but that's not an indicator of a change in strategy or direction, or an effort to limit capital in order to grow free cash flow. Free cash flow growth is a key to our strategy, but we will continue to invest in capital in our network, our products, our operational efficiency and our customer experience, all with the expectation of driving profitable revenue growth and growth in free cash flow per share for the company.","In summary, I feel good about the market opportunity and the progress we're making in serving our customers. You'll see us continue to focus on selling profitable services to our customers, carefully managing our expenses and expanding our margins. We remain committed to and confident in our ability to maintain the dividend.","Before I open the call up for questions, I wanted to take a moment to say thank you to Glen for all of his contributions to CenturyLink and recognize him for the company he's built.","As Glen mentioned, this will be his last earnings call, but he's been the CEO of CenturyLink for 26 years. As CEO, he grew the company from a regional RLEC with a few hundred million in revenue to the $24 billion global enterprise and consumer networking company we are today.","On a personal note, I'd like to thank Glen for his support in my role as COO and the transition to CEO coming in a couple of weeks. I've enjoyed working with and getting to know you, Glen. And I look forward to continuing that relationship with you in your role as a board member.","With that, operator, can you explain the process for asking questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely. Our first question will be from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. Two, if I can. First, I wonder if you can expand more on the sales integration path. Sunit, you said that March trends had strengthened. And can we assume that that holds up in April?","And then, second, Glen \u2013 or I'm sorry, Jeff, how do you think about the potential for the consumer broadband network? You mentioned a focus on CAF areas. But what do you think is the best strategy in competitive markets? Thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll take the first question. So I think, in general, we expect second quarter will be stronger than first quarter. Typically, the last month of the quarter is stronger. But looking at our 90-day sales funnel, in general, I think we expect better sales performance in the second quarter compared to what we saw in the first quarter.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. And I think, so we're doing a lot of things to make sure that the sales environment is good for our sales people. We have complex business. We have complex products.","But we've put things in place like our sales support center, to where our sales people can call if they have questions about either a product or a system that they have to use. So we put in the infrastructure in place to make sure that we can continue to drive sales, in addition to all the marketing and sales support infrastructure that we already had in place.","With respect to consumer broadband, I believe that we can build a very effective consumer broadband product, but it may not be the same in all markets. We'll look at CAF II and make sure that we are investing there in the way to build broadband services in rural market. We've done some trials with fixed wireless and we'll continue to look at other technologies to make sure that we're evaluating the best way to do it.","We know that when we build high-speed capabilities in a market, we can be very effective in competing. And so we will do that and we will make sure that we are marketing more toward those customers where we have high-speed capabilities and where we've expanded our high-speed footprint.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And your comments on competitive markets, we're generally looking to extend our fiber from the central office out, maybe not as much to the household. But by doing that we think we can serve a lot more households with higher broadband speeds.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I might just point out too that, if you look at our top 25 \u2013 you asked about the more relevant (27:27) markets. So if you look at our top 25 markets, we have 40 megabits or more, which has really been the sweet spot for us for about 60% of our households' addressable units. And then, in those same markets, we have about 30% of our households have access to 100 megabits or more. So we have a lot of capacity to sell into there in the months ahead that we've already built.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. And congratulations, Glen, on your retirement.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Phil.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Oh, hey. Thanks for taking my question. Quick one for Sunit. What was the impact of ASC 606 on EBITDA this quarter?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So the impact on that was pretty small. That's why we didn't mention it, but it was slightly positive, but very small.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. I got it. And you guys have talked a lot about using automation and digitization to save money and improve the customer experience over time. It's easy to understand how that works qualitatively. But I was hoping you could maybe help us better understand sort of the numbers behind it, maybe through a case study or something. What sort of investments do you need to make? What sort of timeframe? And what sort of payoffs do you get on those?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Good suggestion. Obviously, we have timelines and payoffs for each individual initiative that we have, and we make sure that we track those things pretty aggressively. We've not really shared those publicly before, but we'll take that as a suggestion.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll give you an easy one. So we've had a lot of success for our Price for Life offering. So, for most of those customers, you can imagine, they're not calling in for billing issues. So you don't need call centers for some of that. So there's a lot of both improvement in customer experience, you don't have to send them a bill, so we're working on paperless billing. So, all of that adds up to pretty significant savings over the next couple of years.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And if it's early, maybe I'll try one last capital structure one. You've got about something like 35% of your debt is floating. Are you happy with that sort of fixed versus floating mix? And how do you think about replacing the floating with fixed, versus waiting for improvements in your credit metrics but bearing interest rate risk over time?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So we are happy with the mix. One of the benefits of \u2013 or two benefits of floating is sort of you get the benefit of the low end of the curve, but also you get the benefit of being able to refinance quicker as our credit spreads improve.","And also I think, generally, with longer-term trades pushing higher, there's more money moving into the floating rate market. So I think, in general, we're happy with the mix. We think it's the right mix of optionality that allows us to take advantage of both the changing interest rate environment plus improving credit spreads, as we drop our debt-to-EBITDA with growing EBITDA.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Shutting down the video business, I don't think that's part of the synergies, but maybe it is. Can you talk about how much you're saving there? And are there other areas that you can shut down a bit?","And then, just two other quick follow-ups. Can you give us what the base is on the broadband of below 20-megs of speed? And then, lastly, any color on the trajectory on voice? That seems to be where most of the weakness is. Does that start to turn asymptotic, or is that already, or just kind of on the outlook there? Thanks a lot.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","All right. Let me see if I could. So first one was the shutdown of the video business. So I think, generally, as we said in our comments, it's not a profitable business, but at the same time, it doesn't save huge amounts of money, but it's just one less thing to focus on.","The second question, Tim, I wasn't clear on what you're saying.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Are there any other businesses that you can shut down that you think you can save maybe a little bit more money and that's non-synergies? But then I was asking on just a clarification on the amount of customers your 20-meg business is...","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So the OTT business is another example. We continue to comb through the rest of our business to see where we have that. But I think, in general, I think these two are good ones, and then we'll continue to look at other businesses.","The base of customers below 20-megs, let's see, I think we have about 1.5 million subscribers, maybe couple of million. Sorry, 2 million.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you. And just on the outlook on the voice business, what you're kind of thinking about it?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Outlook on voice business, it'll continue to decline. I mean, the VoIP business within that will grow, but the voice business is legacy services. We see that continue to decline.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Batya Levi from UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Just a follow-up on the color you provided on SD-WAN. As you sell more hybrid solutions, MPLS and SD-WAN, can you give some sense on if the client ends up purchasing more from you?","And maybe I think you get this question quite a bit, but if you can provide some sense on what percent of your revenues are MPLS right now? And that 45% growth in SD-WAN, did that mostly come from that transition? Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So I'll take the first part of that, Batya, and then let Sunit answer the percentage of revenues and stuff.","We absolutely see SD-WAN as a great product for us, in combination with our other products. Our customers have networking challenges. SD-WAN is a good solution for some of those. MPLS is a good solution for others. Private line, dedicated services, waves, dark fiber, they have different needs for different networking challenges that they have.","And so, yes, when we go to a customer with an MPLS solution several years ago, we didn't necessarily have the opportunity to go down and pick up their really small sites. SD-WAN gives us that capability.","Now, we still have to have the physical infrastructure to get there. That's one of the strengths of the CenturyLink network is that we can layer SD-WAN on top of the physical infrastructure directly to those customers. But we view it as an opportunity for us to gain more market share, both inside our footprint with existing customers and outside our footprint with new customers and existing customers.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I would underline that and I'll tell you the mix. But the underlying thing is the physical footprint is a precursor to be able to offer SD-WAN services. I think that's the big missing piece. And with both the companies coming together, our network footprint is pretty large and very competitive with anyone out there and probably gives us a lot of superiority. So our ability to win SD-WAN, given our physical footprint vis-\u00e0-vis anyone else, gives us tremendous advantage to gain market share, as Jeff pointed out.","Our VPN or MPLS revenues are about 14% of our revenue base. And as I said, it's growing because everything we've seen in our sales funnels from customers where we are typically winning against customers that are being currently served by competitors, they typically need both VPN or MPLS and SD-WAN services as a bundle for their networking requirements, as I mentioned in my remarks.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So, just a quick question on the CAF II. Are you doing all that on wireline basis or using any fixed wireless? And with your decision to drop OTT, would you consider reselling another OTT service, DIRECTV NOW, or a similar product sort of bundled with the broadband?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll answer the first question. I think on CAF II, no, as Jeff pointed out, we're doing some trials but all the CAF II spend is generally wireline spend in rural areas.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And a lot of it though is fiber-based.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","So it's very upgradable if we decide later to do more fixed wireless. The fiber infrastructure that we build is entirely consistent with that approach as well.","The second question, I'm sorry?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Would we resell somebody else's OTT...","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. We do have partnerships with video providers. We have linear programming partnerships where we sell and make sure that, if our customers want a video solution, that we have one to offer them. We'll do the same thing with over-the-top going forward.","We have relationships with most of the over-the-top providers because they're big customers with our CDN networks. And so we'll continue to expand those relationships to make sure that we take to our Consumer customers the products that they want, even if we don't necessarily provide them directly ourselves.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And I might just add on the CAF II. We spent about half that funding to-date, maybe the lower half of the CAF II funding. As Sunit pointed out, it's all been wireline to-date. We are looking at some potential wireless technologies that can be very beneficial in rural America.","But it's still in the leading edge that we certainly like to be able to find some of those solutions that could enable us to serve these customers at a lower cost. And we think that will happen. We, hopefully, can get it in time to allocate some of this CAF funding to those wireless technologies. But we are working on those as we speak.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. And Glen, congratulations on the retirement. You've been great to work with over the years, really appreciate (37:52)","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, congratulations going forward.","Operator","Our next question from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. And, Glen, good luck to you. Be careful on the bulldozer from now on.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll do that, David.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So I guess the first question, Jeff, one of the biggest potential synergies that we saw going into the merger beyond the network synergy savings was going to be taking four players and bringing them down to three in the kind of international, national, enterprise services market. We've heard AT&T and Verizon talk about how they think that they've seen kind of an improvement in the marketplace.","I was wondering if you could kind of tell us what it's like for Level 3 and CenturyLink sales people to walk into accounts together, working together, pricing together, as opposed to pricing and working against one another. And what that has meant to the market and how the market's evolving. And any kind of examples or numbers you can put around that would be super helpful.","And then, Sunit, last quarter, you gave us a lot of help by kind of taking that $2.210 billion, unpacking the $10 million and the $20 million and the $40 million pressures, getting to $2.150 billion for the first quarter and then telling us synergies were on top of that. And that kind of worked out exactly right, $35 million of synergies got us to $2.180 billion EBITDA in the quarter.","Could you kind of give us another kind of look as \u2013 till we sense the cadence of synergy benefits, net of whatever pressures are underlying the business? Kind of how you see second quarter setting up relative to how we saw first quarter setting up? Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So let me start with the sales question, David. And as we go to market with our sales team, it's not that we've gone from four competitors to three competitors. It's the value of the services and the network that we bring to market. The combination of CenturyLink and Level 3 brings such a powerful solution to our customers that we could see great acceptance.","And I'll give you a precursor to that even. The telecom business is a very competitive market for talent. And over the course of the last three to six months, we've seen it to be much easier for us to attract and retain qualified sales people. We see people wanting to come to us, because they see the value that they can take to their customers in selling our products and services.","And so it's really the value of the combined business. It's the value of the network, it's the value of the products and services that we bring in solving our customers' problems. And we're very excited about it and our customers are excited about it.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So on your second question, David, we generally expect fairly steady improvements in EBITDA every quarter. Third quarter has a little extra cost in terms of utility cost, just given air conditioning requirements in our data centers and our network facilities. But in general, we see increasing EBITDA every quarter.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And is the cadence of the synergies, Sunit, going to be roughly what we saw this 1Q, kind of this kind of $30 million, $35 million per quarter step-up?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Well, as I said last quarter, the first year is the steep part of the curve. This was just the first quarter as a combined company. So you might see a little more improvement. But no, I think that's a reasonable pace actually.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay. Thanks for the help.","Operator","Our next question, from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just two, if I could. One, I think you talked about maybe spending picking up in March and into the beginning of the quarter. Are you able to maybe decipher how much of this is just a backlog and pause from customers maybe coming back, relative to maybe more of a broader tailwind from an improving macro backdrop across the economy?","And then, secondly, bigger picture on the dividend. I think, Sunit, you've talked about $500 million and maybe more one-time or specific to 2018 cash flow benefits. As that rolls off in 2019, and maybe bigger picture, is there maybe a target dividend payout ratio you've got in mind for this business and where you'd like to get to? Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","So with respect to spending picking up, I don't really have a good sense for is it backlog or is it overall macro environment. But if you recall previous earnings calls, I don't put a lot of stock in the macroenvironment anyway. I believe that our execution determines whether we're being successful or not.","Do we take the right products and services to the market? If we do, if we do them effectively, if we position them effectively with our customers, they need and want our products and services.","So I think it's probably just we're going to continue to improve as we execute better and as we deliver on the commitments that customers need from us.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","On your question with respect to dividend coverage, I think as I had mentioned last quarter, we generally see our dividend coverage in the 70s, meaning in the 70-plus-percent, 70s, over the next year.","So what that means specifically with respect to next year, we'll clearly see nice growth in EBITDA. You're beginning to see that here in the first quarter. So that will be the theme, expanding EBITDA and EBITDA margins this year and next year. So you'll see good EBITDA growth.","And then below the line, our cash income tax expenses will remain low. We might be able to benefit our interest expense some. And then the other items in working capital, which I think I also alluded to last time in terms of working capital management.","So in general, I think you'll see us excluding the $500 million that I talked about last quarter or we discussed last quarter. You'll generally see good growth in the free cash flow over the next few years, driven by EBITDA increases.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Spencer for Simon. Thanks for taking the questions. On leverage, you laid out a target of 3 to 4 times. Is the goal still to exit 2019 under 4 times? And is that primarily through organic EBITDA growth or will there be some debt pay-down as well?","And then, on integration, I think you're just over a third way through the target $685 million. Should we expect 2019 integration expense to be down versus 2018? Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, integration expenses, as I said, we'll incur a lot of them this year. There'll be some next year. We're still at the $685 million we generally mentioned. We'll see how that goes.","And then, on your other question, I think that when I look at the \u2013 sorry, I missed. EBITDA \u2013 sorry, it was a leverage question. Sorry. Sorry, I apologize.","On the leverage, it's net debt to EBITDA. So, really, debt pay-down is not a factor. It's debt minus cash. And we'll certainly look at options, what's the optimal use of cash, but debt pay-down. We don't have much in the way of debt maturities next couple of years, so we might just pay that off with cash.","But really, net debt to EBITDA, we didn't really set specific targets for leverage at the end of 2018. But we are very confident that we will progress that debt to EBITDA ratio over the next few years. It will come down substantially. As you know, the target we've set is to be in that 3 to 4 times. And I'd expect, by the end of the next years, we'll be at the lower end of that.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","You'll be at the lower end of 3 to 4 times by the end of 2019. Yeah. Okay. Thanks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Do we have another question, operator?","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Mike McCormack from Guggenheim Securities. And this will be our last question. Please go ahead, sir.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. And congrats, Glen. It's been a long run together. Thinking about I guess Consumer, Jeff, you had talked about the idea that a little focus there, obviously, at high margin, high cash flow. As you think about at least the initial look at that business on the Consumer side, what have been your sort of takeaways and what do you see is the opportunity there?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","The takeaways, the better customer experience we provide, the better off for our business. And so we are focused on providing a great customer experience. We're focused on migrating our customers to a digital environment and a digital exchange with us. And we're one of the few industries where we've trained people not to do everything online. We've trained them to call us.","And that's probably not the best approach in today's environments, probably not the approach customers want us to take. Sunit gave some examples earlier. If we can reduce the calls, we provided a better customer experience. So how do we reduce calls? It's not just by handling them better. It's not just by redirecting them to websites. It's by changing the need for them to call us.","Our initiatives around Price for Life. Let's not have a whole bunch of complex promotional plans where customers are continually rolling off the previous plan, or rolling some rebate or discount of, and they call us because it looks like our bill has gone up every month, when it's just the promotional plan that they run is ending. Let's get them on Price for Life. Let's continue to give them a consistent service. If bill doesn't change, they don't need to call us. They don't feel like the rates are going up. We can guarantee them that price.","And so those are some of the things that we're doing, continuing to simplify the way that we interact with our customers on repair and on installs, making sure we have short intervals and windows when we expect people to show up. And so there are a lot of things that we can do and are doing and have been doing to continually improve our customer experience. That's the first and foremost.","Secondly, we have good products and services that we can continue to build for our customers. And let's make sure that where we have 100 megabits and above in the markets that Glen described earlier, that we go out and we sell those products and services to the customers. That we figure out how to really leverage some of our security capabilities and deliver those to our Consumer customers. And so, continue to enhance the product set.","And then, lastly, focus on a limited set of profitable products rather than trying to be a one-stop shop with everything from over-the-top to linear programming. Let's make sure that we have the solutions for our customers that want some of those, but that we don't necessarily have to do them ourselves. And focus on profitability and focus on streamlining our business for our technicians and for our sales people and for our entire team.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","And Mr. Post, I will return the call back to you for your closing remarks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Franz. In closing, CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3 was certainly a significant step forward in continuing the transformation of our company. And our first quarter results provide solid confirmation of the benefits, the opportunities and the promise of this strategic combination.","Our goal is to continue to build on this momentum in subsequent quarters, as Jeff referred to earlier. We remain focused on achieving our operating and capital synergy targets, digitally transforming our business and delivering a great customer experience by driving profitable growth.","Again, it is indeed bittersweet for me given this is my last quarterly call with you as CEO of CenturyLink. But it is the right time for me to retire, and Jeff is the right leader to drive the continuing transformation and growth of CenturyLink in the months and years to come.","It's been my honor to be a part of this great company and to have had the privilege of leading and working with so many great p, as we transformed CenturyLink from a small rural local exchange company to one of the world's leading networking companies today.","Thank you for all of your support over the years and I look forward to joining you in watching and anticipating CenturyLink's growth in the months and years ahead. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Post. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using the CenturyLink's conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2012 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","On Slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2012, some outlooks for 2013, the integration of Qwest and Savvis and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide, as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.","We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at www.centurylink.com.","Now turning to Slide 3. Your host for today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer. And also available during the question-and-answer period of today's call will be Karen Puckett, CenturyLink's Chief Operating Officer, who leads our Regional Markets Segment; Bill Cheek, President of our Wholesale Markets Segment; and Jim Ousley, Chief Executive Officer of Savvis and President of our Enterprise Market Segment.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through November 14, 2012 and accessible by webcast through November 28, 2012. Anyone listening to a tape or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of November 7, 2012 and should be considered valid only as of this date regardless of the date heard or viewed.","As we move to Slide 4, I will now turn the call over to your host today, Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. First, I want to express my sympathies to those affected by the storm along the East Coast last week. Located in Louisiana, we, of course, are all too aware of the devastation of hurricanes and tropical storms can create, and our thoughts are with all those affected.","CenturyLink did experience some operational disruptions as a result of the storm. However, we are pleased that all of our East Coast data centers remained fully functioning during the storm, so we could continue to serve our customers during this difficult time.","Early indications are that we experienced about $5  million to $6 million of operating and capital expenses as a result of the storm, so we were relatively displaced less than I know many were. I also want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication to ensuring the best possible service for our customers during this difficult time.","Now I'll turn to discuss CenturyLink's third quarter 2012 results and guidance for our fourth quarter and full year 2012, as we provide other updates -- as well as provide other updates about our business.","During the third quarter, CenturyLink has achieved solid results, and we continue to make progress on a number of fronts. We remain on track to meet our synergy targets for the Qwest and Savvis transactions and continue to make progress with the integration of these 2 acquisitions. We continue to see solid growth in our Enterprise Markets and Regional Markets business segment with continued demand for integrated network, colocation, managed hosting and cloud services.","We also continue to invest in additional data center capacity to drive further growth from these services in the months ahead. With our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, we continue to make excellent progress in completing fiber builds, enabling high-bandwidth Ethernet data services to support the growing demand for wireless data backhaul capacity. We are experiencing some near-term revenue pressure resulting from the transition from copper-based data services to fiber and Ethernet connectivity. However, we are confident that our investment in fiber-to-the-tower will generate good returns and provide solid revenue growth over the lives of these agreements.","We're pleased to announce the soft launch of our Prism TV service in the Phoenix market. By the end of this year, this will be our first legacy Qwest market that we will offer the service. We anticipate the commercial launch in the first half of 2013. Additionally, we expect to enter our second legacy Qwest market in mid-2013.","Finally, in October, we launched our click-to-buy managed hosting and cloud service platform for businesses of all sizes, and we'll talk a little more about that later on.","Now turning to Slide 5. We made continued progress in improving our top line revenue trends. In the third quarter, we generated revenue of $4.57 billion, a 1.3% year-over-year decline, but comparing favorably to the 4.6% decline for pro forma third quarter 2011. Excluding data integration revenues, which widely fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, the annual revenue decline in third quarter was 1.4%.","For full year 2012, we remain on track to reduce annual revenue rate of decline to the 1.5% to 2% range. The integration of Qwest and Savvis remains on track, and we will continue to leverage these assets to strengthen our competitive position throughout our operating areas.","As of the end of the third quarter, we achieved an annual synergy run rate of $450 million related to Qwest integration. We now expect to end 2012 with an annual synergy run rate of $480 million related to Qwest, up from $465 million previously anticipated, as operating expense savings are being achieved earlier than expected.","Also in the third quarter, we achieved strong improvement in access line loss and continued subscriber growth in broadband and Prism TV services. And during the quarter, we generated strong strategic data growth from our business customers in both Regional Markets and Enterprise Markets segments.","As of the third quarter, business customers drive more than 60% of our total operating revenues. As we move forward, we remain focused on making disciplined investments in our strategic initiatives to drive growth in top line revenue and, over time, EBITDA and free cash flow improvement.","Turning now to Slide 6. I will briefly discuss our preliminary outlook for 2013. We expect to provide full guidance for 2013 in mid-February, when we release our fourth quarter 2012 results. That said, we believe the investments made in our key strategic initiatives have been successful in driving additional strategic revenue growth in 2012, and we expect to continue investing operating capital dollars in these key areas.","We anticipate further improvement in the top line revenue trend in 2013 with a year-over-year rate of decline in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% compared with full year 2012. We now believe we will reach revenue stabilization in 2014.","As I mentioned, we expect to continue to invest in the key strategic initiatives in 2013. With these strategic investments and the continuing shift in the company's revenue mix, along with the lower level of incremental annual synergies in 2013, I anticipate it to negatively impact operating and free cash flows for 2013 as compared with 2012.","Currently, due to the high level of synergies achieved in 2012 and late 2011, we anticipate approximately $150 million to $200 million lower incremental synergies in 2013 compared to the level achieved in 2012.","On Slide 7, the chart illustrates the steady improvement we have made in operating revenues and strengthening strategic services, and lower access line losses have helped reduced the quarterly rate of decline. And for the third quarter, we achieved a 1.3% rate of revenue decline, and we remain on track for a 1.5% to 2% annual revenue decline for full year 2012, a significant improvement over the 3.8% pro forma revenue decline in 2011.","Now turning to Slide 8. Third quarter revenue declined 0.9% from second quarter 2012 as growth in strategic revenue was offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. Our strategic revenue growth was driven by strength in high-speed Internet and high-bandwidth business data services.","Additionally, during the quarter, we experienced a small net decrease in the legacy revenues due to the implementation of the CAF Order, in which the rate step-down was largely offset by Access Recovery Charges implemented beginning July 1, 2012.","Third quarter 2012 revenue declined 1.3% from pro forma third quarter 2011. Again, growth in strategic revenue was offset by lower legacy revenues due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. MPLS and Ethernet services, high-speed Internet, managed hosting products and Prism revenue continued to grow.","Now moving to Slide 9, I will provide a few highlights regarding our strategic initiatives. As we've outlined over the past several quarters, we are focused on continued strategic investment in broadband expansion and enhancement, Prism TV, fiber-to-the-tower and managed hosting and cloud computing services. Our third quarter results reflect the solid progress we're making in these key initiatives.","Starting with broadband expansion and enhancement, we continue to make significant investments in this area. And during the third quarter, we added over 44,000 high-speed Internet customers. This represents a solid rebound in new subscribers from a seasonally weak second quarter '12. We -- with these new subscribers, we now have more than 5.8% -- 5.8 million broadband customers.","Our customer retention efforts and the growth benefit of bundling broadband with other products and services contributed to the continued decline of the rate of access line loss, which improved from 7.1% in third quarter 2011 to 5.8% in third quarter 2012. We also expanded our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure to more than 310,000 new living units during the quarter. We now pass over 6.8 million living units with fiber-to-the-node, and we expect to pass approximately 7 million living units by end of this year.","As a result of our network investment enhancements, broadband speed availability has continued to improve. Over 70% of our enabled access lines receive speeds of 6 megabits or higher, more than 57% of enabled lines received 10 megabits or higher and then 29% have speeds of 20 megabits or higher.","Additionally, during the quarter, we continued to expand our Ethernet over copper footprint, which has increased nearly 70% year-to-date. We expect to continue to make investments on our network to enhance speed capabilities to deliver competitive broadband products and services across our markets.","Turning to Slide 10, our Prism TV service represents a very compelling entertainment alternative to cable. In the 8 markets, where it is currently available, it continues to perform well. We added over 10,000 Prism TV subscribers here in the third quarter, ending the period of more than 104,000 subscribers. Of the new subscribers we've added over the past 12 months, approximately 55% were new customers to CenturyLink. We now have a penetration rate of over 10% across the 8 markets, in which the service is available. In addition, we continue to enhance our IPTV experience by introducing new functionality and application.","Prism TV continues to have a positive impact on churn and line loss trends. We experienced greater than 90% broadband pull-through rate with our Prism TV sales to new customers. We continue to expand our Prism TV-enabled footprint, and expect to drive additional subscriber growth in the months ahead.","As I mentioned, we are on track, by the end of the year, to soft launch Prism TV in Phoenix, which will be our first legacy Qwest market to receive the service. The Phoenix market will be commercially launched in the first half of 2013, and we expect a second legacy Qwest market in mid-2013.","Continuing onto Slide 11, the third key strategic initiative is investing in fiber builds to as many towers in our service area as economically feasible. During the third quarter, we completed approximately 1,335 fiber builds for a total of over 3,300 year-to-date, and we currently anticipate completing 4,000 to 4,500 builds in 2012. This initiative supports an anticipated long-term growth in data transport, much of which is driven by wireless data traffic. It also expands our addressable customer footprint by enabling fiber access points to other strategic locations, where viable, along these routes.","We believe our fiber-to-the-tower program helps solidify our wholesale access revenue for the long term and assists in the stabilization of our revenue trend. As we have discussed with you before, we're experiencing some revenue compression as our wireless wholesale customers transition to copper-based DS1 facilities to fiber-based Ethernet services. However, we anticipate that wireless bandwidth growth will result in expansion of Ethernet consumption, reversing the revenue -- current revenue compression by late 2013.","Moving onto Slide 12. We continue to invest in managed hosting and cloud services to increase our data center capacity, as well as expand our product portfolio to meet customer needs and expand our market opportunity. During the quarter, we opened a data center in Singapore and expanded capacity in a data center in the New York\/New Jersey market. We ended the quarter with 53 data centers in North America, Europe and Asia with total sellable floor space of approximately 1.4 million square feet, as we continue to expand the global reach of our managed hosting services.","While we continue to see strong demand in the hosting market, third quarter bookings came in lighter than expected as we believe a handful of potential large deals were pushed to the fourth quarter. We're working hard to improve our prospect-close ratio. We expect stronger bookings in the fourth quarter, and we're focused on opportunities for growth from both new prospects and our current client base.","Savvis was recently recognized as a leader in Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service. We also anticipate increasing hosting and cloud expansion opportunities, as we further train and enable Enterprise Markets, Regional Markets and Wholesale Markets sales channels. We expect to see incremental revenues from these channels in 2013.","In the months ahead, we will focus on allowing -- on aligning hosting product offerings and solutions bundles with existing Regional Markets and Enterprise Markets-Network client needs.","In October, we announced the beta launch of Savvis Direct, our simplified approach to cloud computing for businesses of all sizes. And finally, we -- on October 15, we closed the acquisition of certain assets of Ciber's global IT Outsourcing, or ITO business.","In addition, these assets will complement Savvis' existing ITO assets by expanding our capabilities for application management services and help desk support.","And now onto Slide 13. In summary, I am pleased with the third quarter results. We continue to improve our top line revenue trends. Our employees did a good job of containing costs, and we generated solid cash flows during the quarter. We reduced our access line losses by 22% compared to the pro forma third quarter 2011, and we achieved high-speed Internet subscriber growth, as well as solid increase of Prism customers.","Also, the focused investments we have made in our key strategic initiatives have positively contributed to a strategic revenue growth and continued to improve our top line revenue trend. We believe the soft launch of Prism TV into the Phoenix market towards the end of this year will present -- position us well to grow video subscribers in 2013 and beyond. And lastly, we feel good about leveraging the acquisition of Savvis to generate organic growth. Our new Savvis Direct product offers the opportunity to gain market share in the fast-growing cloud space across our interior -- entire range of customers.","With this, I'll turn this call over to Stewart for in-depth look at our financial results. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the third quarter, and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the fourth quarter and full year 2012 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Turning to Slide 15. First, in order to provide more relevant comparisons, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro-forma basis as if Savvis were included in the results for all periods. I'll also be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules.","With that, let's turn to our results for the third quarter. As you can see, we generated strong operating revenues and solid cash flows. Operating revenues were $4.57 billion on a consolidated basis, which was in line with our guidance for the quarter and represented 1.3% decline from pro forma third quarter 2011 operating revenues. This also represents a solid improvement from the 4.6% annual decline in the year-ago period. Strategic revenue in the quarter increased to 46% of total revenue from 43% in the pro forma third quarter a year ago due to growth in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data services, Prism TV and managed hosting services.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.66, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance by about $0.095. The difference from our expectations were driven primarily by lower depreciation and amortization, lower-than-expected seasonal plant maintenance, lower property taxes and a slightly better-than-expected impact from the implementation of the CAF Order along with higher synergy achievement.","As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments. Total cash operating expenses decreased from pro forma third quarter 2011 to third quarter 2012 with synergy achievement, lower marketing and advertising costs and other cost reductions, partially offset by continued investments in our key initiatives, as well as other costs related to revenue growth.","We generated solid operating cash flow of approximately $1.9 billion for third quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 41.5%. Additionally, we generated $905 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income.","Our strong cash flow is continuing to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to Slide 16. I'll begin my operating segments discussion today with our Regional Markets segment. Regional Markets generated $2.47 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 2.1% over pro forma third quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $912 million in the quarter, up 7.9% pro forma year-over-year. Excluding the impact of private line revenue, strategic services grew approximately 9%.","Legacy services revenues for the segment declined $108 million or 6.8% from pro forma third quarter 2011 due primarily to a continuing decline in revenues related to access lines, partially mitigated by implementation of the access recovery charge.","Our expense reductions for the quarter, compared with the previous year, were mainly driven by lower employee-related expenses, which were partially offset by higher Prism TV expenses.","Moving to Slide 17. Our Wholesale Markets segment generated $908 million in operating revenues, a decline of 7.6% from pro forma third quarter 2011. Strategic revenues for Wholesale Markets declined 1% to $568 million from pro forma third quarter 2011, primarily driven by the rate compression in special access services as customers transitioned to Ethernet-based services. Wholesale Markets legacy revenues declined by 17% to $340 million, reflecting the continued decline in access in long-distance revenues and the implementation of the CAF Order rate step-down.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $273 million, 11% below the pro forma period from the year -- prior year driven by lower access expense and allocated costs.","Moving to Slide 18, Enterprise Markets Network segment generated $658 million in operating revenues during the third quarter, which represented an increase of 5.6% from pro forma third quarter 2011.","The third quarter represented the third consecutive quarter of sequential growth in recurring revenues from a Network Services segment. The third quarter strategic revenues for Enterprise Markets-Network increased by $23 million or 7.2% to $341 million from pro forma third quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high-bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and DWDM. Excluding Private Line Services, strategic revenue grew more than 13% from the pro forma year-ago period.","Legacy revenue declined by $3 million from pro forma third quarter 2011 due primarily to declines in local and legacy Wide Area Network services while data integration revenues increased $15 million or 17% due to higher equipment sales and professional services revenues from government and enterprise customers. Our total segment expenses declined $13 million from the same period a year ago.","Now turning to Slide 19 and Enterprise Markets Data Hosting segment, which is primarily the Savvis legacy operations -- legacy Savvis operations. This segment generated $280 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 8.1% from pro forma third quarter 2011 revenues of $259 million. This growth came primarily from year-over-year increases of 7.6% in colocation revenues and 9.2% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues and a 7.1% increase in Network Services revenues.","Strong first half 2012 bookings in hosting services helped drive this revenue growth in the third quarter. While churn was in line with the expectation for third quarter, we do anticipate a slight increase in fourth quarter churn due to bankruptcy-related issues. The Enterprise Markets Data Hosting operating expenses were $219 million in third quarter compared to $193 million in the pro forma third quarter a year ago. This increase of 13.5% is driven by added headcounts to support revenue growth, including our Savvis Direct operations.","Slide 20 addresses our fourth quarter and full year 2012 guidance, which includes the acquisition of Ciber. The company expects fourth quarter 2012 operating revenues and cash flow to increase compared to third quarter 2012 due to anticipated continued growth and strategic revenues and lower outside plant maintenance and utility costs.","Additionally, we expect depreciation and amortization to be $20 million to $30 million higher for fourth quarter 2012 than it was for the third quarter due to higher balances of plant in [ph]   service and a onetime adjustment to software amortization that occurred in the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter 2012, CenturyLink projects total operating revenues of $4.56 billion to $4.61 billion and operating cash flow between $1.9 billion and $1.94 billion and adjusted EPS is expected to be $0.64 to $0.69. To reflect the year-to-date performance and fourth quarter expectations, we've also updated our previously given full year 2012 guidance, and this is provided in our press release.","Turning to Slide 21. In summary, we're generating solid strategic revenue growth. We achieved good cost containment during the quarter and achieved Qwest synergies earlier than anticipated -- originally anticipated. And finally, we continue to believe a solid balance sheet is important to our financial flexibility and feel confident about our cash flow generating ability, which allows CenturyLink to return meaningful cash to our shareholders. That concludes our prepared remarks for today.","So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Barden from Merrill Lynch.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to just ask maybe a couple more strategic questions, if I could, Glen. Obviously, in the last couple of months, I think that there's been some maybe erroneous reports that CenturyLink was trying to buy TW Telecom and your stock took it on the chin to the tune of a couple of dollars as result of those reports, which I think were later actually retracted. But I was wondering if you could kind of set the table a little bit based on where you are in the integration and what your appetites are when we see these kinds of reports, how should we be reacting to them? And then, I guess the second question is -- obviously, the free cash flows are coming in ahead of expectations. The guidance is going up. I know that you guys have talked about stock buybacks as a priority for cash, but could you revisit your thinking about how you consider the dividend -- being a dividend-paying company versus maybe being a dividend growth company, looking into maybe next year?","Glen F. Post","Yes. David, first of all regarding the acquisition rumors and where we are with these 2 for inorganic growth, we have -- really, we're focused on the -- investing in our 4 primary growth initiatives that we've talked about: the broadband expansion and enhancement, fiber-to-the-node, fiber-to-the-tower initiative, the managed hosting, cloud service and our Prism TV services. The integration of Qwest and Savvis is going well, but there's still a lot to do. We're achieving expected -- hit our objectives in terms of synergies, but there's a lot of work to do. These are large acquisitions and to do them right, it's going to take more time, as we've stated previously. So there's a lot of focus there. We don't feel the need to acquire in order to drive growth. Our 4 initiatives have strong potential for driving growth, and our size is good. We don't need the additional synergies necessarily that additional acquisitions would bring. We'll continue to evaluate investment opportunities that arise, both organic and inorganic, but we don't feel compelled to make an acquisition. We'll be focused on ways to create [ph] value for shareholders, but there's no -- we don't feel compelled, and we are not out beating the bushes looking for an acquisition. So I'll leave it at that. That's pretty much how we feel about our position here.  As far as increasing the dividend or stock buybacks, that's obviously a question that we consider continually with our board. We'll continue to evaluate the best ways to create value for shareholders. Obviously, how we utilize our cash is a key component of that process. We'll consider our future reduced debt and the value of debt reduction. We'll look at the benefits of increasing the dividend or buying back stock --  what that can mean to value for shareholders. And we'll continue to consider investment opportunities, both organic and inorganic, that can drive value for shareholders. These are obviously important and complex considerations, and we'll continue our very disciplined approach to these types of investment decisions. Again, with the objective of really maximizing long term shareholder value.","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Glen, if I could just follow up on that real quick. Obviously, we saw about 2.3% increase in the dividend from AT&T today, and I think the investors tend to look at dividend growth companies as being a higher value proposition than simply companies that pay out a dividend. Do you agree with that, that statement, and do you think that CenturyLink has it within its financial wherewithal to maybe support that kind of limited amount of dividend growth, but growth nevertheless?","Glen F. Post","I'm sorry, do I support what? Agree with what statement?","David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","The idea that there's a higher value to companies that grow their dividend, even if it's only a small amount, as opposed to just simply keeping a dividend steady through time.","Glen F. Post","Yes, I have seen some studies that indicate that companies that grow their dividend do drive value -- good value for shareholders. So yes, I have seen some of that, and I don't have any -- don't disagree with the studies. It's something that we consider as we talk about our use of free cash flow basically every quarter and certainly every year. We talk in detail about what's the best way for us to drive long term shareholder value, and we realize that growing dividends is one way that companies have done that over time. So it is part of our consideration.","Operator","Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question on revenue trends. Revenue decline has been consistently improving every quarter for a while now. You mentioned in 4Q you're expecting some churn from Savvis. Can you -- maybe can you clarify, do you still expect Savvis to -- Savvis revenue growth to accelerate to double digits in 4Q? And your 4Q guidance suggests that revenue decline will stay at flattish. Is that a function of this churn that we talked about or what else is in there? And then mainly just a clarification for your longer-term guidance for revenue stabilization in '14. Do you expect some stabilization in '13, end of '13 and then maybe flat revenues in '14 or will we see some declining trends in '14?","Glen F. Post","Batya, this is Glen. I'll talk on this, start about Savvis, and I'll ask Jim Ousley to also comment. The churn absolutely impacted us, a couple of companies that were in bankruptcy -- it impacted us during the quarter. Also just the longer decision-making process that we're seeing with some enterprise customers, we think that impacted the -- or affected the bookings for the third quarter. That will of course roll into the fourth quarter as far as our revenue growth and early next year. However, we feel very good about the demand that's out there, the potential, the interest from customers, the potential funnel that we have out there. So we still feel very good about the growth here. It's just a matter of getting some of these deals closed and secondly just the churn that we experienced or experienced in the latter part of this year. Jim, you want to?","James Ernest Ousley","Yes, this is Jim Ousley, and I would just support what Glen said. We do -- we would expect that fourth quarter hosting revenue will be double digit kinds of growth levels. So we still stand by that, what we've been saying. And the effects of 2 major churn events in the fourth quarter which were bankruptcies will flatten it a little more, but it'll still be double digit, and we see no downturn in demand. As we and some of our competitors have stated before, the only issue we're seeing is the elongation of decision-making for Savvis Direct [ph]   large enterprise customers are clearly taking longer. They're not buying. They're just taking longer to make decisions. Hopefully, that'll ease with the election and all the other issues and the macroeconomics issue. But we're still seeing strong demand.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe the question about longer-term revenue decline. Would you expect some stabilization in 2013?","R. Stewart Ewing","Batya, with respect to the statement that Glen made in the release on revenue stabilization in '14, we really hope -- hopefully, we'll have revenues such that in 2014 it'll be equivalent to a 2013 revenue on a full year basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Glen, can you just update us on the labor negotiations? Where are we at this point? Any hope of a near-term resolution? We've obviously seen Verizon strike a deal. Presumably, there's a little bit of a template there. And Verizon and AT&T have made some differing proposals on their pension. Have you got any interest in pursuing either of those sort of approaches? And maybe if you can just talk a little bit about CapEx levels for '13? We obviously saw AT&T increase their capital spending. Are you likely to hold capital budgets pretty similar to 2012? What's implied in your initial guidance?","Glen F. Post","Simon, first of all on the pension that AT&T and Verizon have done, the stabilization there. We were looking, evaluating them and made no decisions there. Stewart may want to talk about that more in a moment. But we have -- it's an area we are looking at and evaluating. As far as labor negotiations, the current contracts with the legacy Qwest unions were set to expire on October 6. We and the unions agreed to extend the current agreements day-to-day as we continue the negotiations. Our primary focus on these discussions of course is to more closely align our cost structure with the competitive marketplace, the revenue streams that we are seeing and operating in, while continuing to provide our employees competitive wages and benefits. So that's our goal here. We have a number of issues to work through, but we believe we're making progress with these negotiations. And we're not targeting a specific date that we want to complete this agreement by, but we are hopeful that the process can be resolved without too much further delay. We believe we are again making progress in these discussions. And the final question on CapEx, we expect CapEx to be in the range it is in 2012. It can be slightly higher as we due to some expansion of the data center expansion and along with the Prism TV investments. And this is pursuing our strategic initiatives. But we are going to take a very disciplined approach to those investments and if we just see any increase involved [ph] , it will be what we expect revenue gains in the relatively near future from those investments.","R. Stewart Ewing","Simon, just a couple of quick comments on the negotiations. Qwest, either the last time they renegotiated the contract or the time before last, they moved new bargaining unit employees that are hired subsequent to that date over to a cash balance plan. So there is no longer really a defined benefit plan for the new Qwest employees. And again, secondly, we are reviewing what others have done with respect to the plans, and we'll decide at some point if we want to try to execute a transaction similar to what has been done.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just quickly on the Savvis side, I'm seeing you're working on some more customer-facing cloud products for SMB customers and small -- a little simpler interface and so forth. Where does that stand? How successful is that? And then, just on a bigger picture, you've been consistently hitting and exceeding the guidance targets on top line and cash flow and so forth, which is refreshing. What would it take for you to get to positive top line growth in 2013? I mean, you're guiding to maybe negative 0.5%, that's getting pretty close. Is that a possibility and what would have to change? Is that more of a macro issue?","Glen F. Post","Yes, Frank, first of all, Savvis Direct, we had our launch, our self-launch in October, and it's going well thus far. We have a lot of high hopes, anticipation for the success of this product. It's a one click, easy-to-use web-based solution, and we're seeing lots of interest from customers. Of course,  it will start in the small and midsized businesses where we see the most interest, but also there'll be, you'll have the large enterprise business who will eventually use more of the public cloud and this one-click type [indiscernible] that we're providing there. So it is a significant rollout for us, and we believe it's going to have a major impact in the years ahead on the growth. As far as top line growth and what would have to take place, and we just have to see some of these new initiatives take off a little faster than we anticipate. Now we're trying to be conservative on those, but if they were to take off faster, the rollouts were a little more quickly done, and the penetration rates exceeded what we were anticipating, and that could change the -- we'd see some increases there. But that's what it would really require.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just thinking about the sort of 2013 look that you've given us. And I know, Glen, you had mentioned obviously the Qwest synergy opportunity won't be there obviously in '13. But if it weren't for the Qwest headwind, would you have expected EBITDA to be flat absent that sort of $200 million to $250 million headwind on synergies year-over-year? And then Stewart, just thinking about cash taxes, what's your current thought process on when that starts to kick in? And also maybe wrap in the discussion about the potential pension funding.","Glen F. Post","Mike, regarding the EBITDA, if we'd had the same level of incremental synergy, we would've been close to flat, right around even there, breakeven on the EBITDA. That's correct. We just saw it based a lot of those initial start-up cost, expenses, investments and the new initiatives especially.","R. Stewart Ewing","And Mike, with respect to cash taxes in '13, probably around $100 million or so. We'll still be using the Qwest NOLs. We'll continue to use the NOLs in 2014 and probably complete the utilization of all the NOLs. We don't have a cash tax number to talk about yet for '14. Pension funding, required contributions for next year, 2013's a little over $100 million. We may possibly look at doing that towards the end of this year as we did last year for the 2012 contribution that we made.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Goldman from Goldman Sachs.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess when I look at the EBITDA for this quarter and you guys exceeded the top end of your guidance by a pretty healthy mark, which I think is the second time you've done that this year. And I guess what I'm trying to figure out as I've gone through the different quarters this year is, what's changed as you go through and you issue your guidance and then you come out with a higher number on the quarters? Are these costs that are merely being pushed out, perhaps on the Prism IP TV into the next year? Are these the more seasonal maintenance costs and the lower property taxes that you highlighted on the EPS slide that really drove that? And of those costs, sort of which ones are onetime in nature versus sustainable cost improvements?","R. Stewart Ewing","So Scott, I think what's happened is we've exceeded the top end of the guidance because we've been able to get some of the Qwest synergies quicker than we had otherwise expected in the guidance that we gave, and it's really in the strategic sourcing area, network integration area and some headcount as well. In terms of onetime items that we had in the third quarter, probably the larger onetime item that we had that's reflected is the, we had about a $20 million reduction in property taxes, below what we expected for the third quarter. $12 million of that was related to a true-up or finalization really of a prior year property tax issue in the state of Florida that came with us -- to us from Embarq. And then basically, the remainder of it was really related to a state where we were able to successfully reduce an assessment that they had previously provided to us.","Scott Goldman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess just listening to AT&T, at the Analyst Day today, they laid out a path for investment in broadband whereby they plan to bring speeds up to 100 megabits per second on the U-verse platform, probably 75 megabits or even higher on using IPDSLAM technology. Glen, you laid out sort of the coverage where your speeds are up to, say, 20 megabits per second for 1\/4 or more of your territory. Just wondering longer term how comfortable you are with the speeds you're driving towards now? Do you feel the need to maybe have to drive to the 50 megabit or 100 megabit by either driving fiber out deeper or utilizing pair bonding or some of the other technologies that may be out there?","Glen F. Post","Yes, Scott, we do think we'll need to continue to drive additional speeds. We think -- we're shooting for the 20 megabit, 25 megabits for a very large percentage of our areas. But with bonding, we can virtually double the capacity that -- the broadband capacity and speeds in our markets. We're already doing bonding in a number of markets today. So where ever we have 20 megabits, basically, we could have 40. Where you have 10, you could have 20. So that is a major area we're looking at. We look at the -- with our fiber-to-the-node work, where we're hitting 25 to 40 megabits and depending on the distance to our customer's prim [ph] , and then we can double that to 80 megabits. And the fiber-to-the-node work there, it's a large percentage of those customers. We are doing the same thing -- looking at ways to economically reach that customer base with higher speeds. And it's important us. That's why our broadband investment is one of our key initiatives. We're expanding our broadband capabilities. That's a key investment for us and helps drive our penetration levels as well with our broadband products.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi.","Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is, if you could just size the revenue that you get, the access revenue you get from towers, from the combination of copper and fiber? And then secondly, I was wondering if you could, just going back to the cloud and managed services business that you have, what are you seeing in terms of the learnings, the ability to cross-sell telecom services to your cloud customers and vice versa? And are there other areas that you need to develop to further create this cross-selling opportunity, rather sales force-wise, customer service, any other kind of infrastructure that you need? It'd be great to see -- to get your perspective there.","Glen F. Post","Mike, we haven't given, and I actually don't have right now the access revenue that we get from towers, whether they be fiber or copper. But we obviously serve a very high percentage of the towers in our legacy local exchange areas, either with copper or fiber. And we'll have -- by the end of the quarter, we had about 13,500 towers that we had built fiber to. So it's a good -- and they're all under long-term contracts. So it's a good growing revenue stream for us as bandwidth demands increase.","James Ernest Ousley","This is Jim Ousley. On the second part, on the cloud and managed services crossover, we clearly see the opportunity there. And in fact, we have put a major organization in place of roughly 10% to 15% of the Savvis sales and marketing group are now dedicated to enabling the CenturyLink sales organization to start selling hosting and cloud services. So we see a lot of pull-through there. I would say, it's not a surprise to us, I would say that it's not an overnight process. It's going to take a couple of quarters of training programs, certification programs, et cetera to get the organization up to speed to take on that challenge. But the pull-through going both ways, major network customers that need hosting and major hosting customers that need network, we see significant opportunity. And we will start realizing that based on the training programs in the first quarter of 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","I wondered if you could talk about the enterprise business. We've seen a series of weak results across the board from your competitors so far in enterprise and SME, and I wanted to know if you could talk about -- they cited specifically weakness in Europe. What are you not seeing that others have seen so far this quarter?","Glen F. Post","Well, Kevin, we're seeing long delayed -- longer decision cycle times. We had benefited from some pretty large customer deals we've had coming in over the last few months, the last few quarters, that really came to fruition over the last few months. So we've been fortunate, we've had a lot of demand in our areas. I don't know that we're seeing anything different. We're not seeing a lot of improvement in the economy. We are seeing businesses be willing to spend more. But in recent months, we're seeing that delay come -- just like the other carriers have said, we're seeing the same thing. It's just that our revenue has not been impacted like those because some deals we had going that are really -- been good. Our salespeople, our management folks in enterprise group have done a great job of penetrating that market and continuing to grow our revenues in that sector. So it's certainly a challenge, but our folks have done a good job. The issue we see is lack of job growth and what's that going to do longer term to this demand and decision cycle for these businesses. Jim, you want to add anything to that?","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","Can you also give us a little granularity as to your exposure to Europe as a percentage of revenue now? Others have clearly cited Europe and multinationals exposure to Europe as a big area of weakness.","James Ernest Ousley","Yes, I'll try and address both of your questions. One, CenturyLink in total has very little exposure to Europe. Savvis has some exposure to Europe, but it's fairly minimal and most of our business is in U.K. so we're not affected by the Southern Europe issues that are going on. So minimal impact in Europe to speak of. On the enterprise piece, I would say 2 things are going on. One, we're smaller than our major, our other 2 major competitors. So we have the ability to go after segments that they aren't really paying attention to. And so we put some very focused programs in place that we're seeing very positive results from on a quarter-to-quarter basis on winning business away from those competitors. To be honest, they just aren't paying attention to. So those -- I would say it's in execution, that organization, enterprise network group has executed some focused programs quite effectively.","Operator","Our next question comes from Timothy Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I had 2 broad questions. One for Jim, with Savvis, how important is it for you have the bandwidth and fiber connectivity? I guess, how much benefit has Qwest long distance network and fiber connections brought you? And then second, for Glen, some of the carriers are talking about using wireless to be able to shutdown copper and replace the copper to save expenses, I know both in the U.S. and globally. Do you think that sounds feasible from a regulatory perspective and an economic and quality perspective?","James Ernest Ousley","On your first question, the fiber connectivity, the whole cloud agenda, if you will, is network-based. And for enterprise, which Savvis is focused on, it's high-speed connectivity. So Savvis used to buy those services from third parties and wasn't very good at providing them. So we had to subcontract those, et cetera. Now as part of CenturyLink, one, we have a cost advantage compared to what we had before, and we have a parent that is in the business. And so it should be extremely important to us, and we believe it will be and as far as the rationale on the acquisition.","Glen F. Post","Tim, regarding using wireless to displace copper. From a regulatory standpoint, that could be a tough go. There may be some areas that will have better service with wireless in some ways. As far as a competitive threat, we don't see that being a real issue for us because just the bandwidth requirements and the limited wireless access or capability in a lot of areas. Obviously, in the most rural areas, it could be an issue, but we're not seeing -- we don't see that as being a major issue right now for CenturyLink. We are looking at the opportunity to use broadband data in some different ways to serve these customers. But right now, we don't see that as a major investment for us or a major risk at this point.","Operator","And our final question for tonight will be from Brian Turner from JPMorgan.","Brian Turner","Just in the context of the initial '13 guidance, the continued improvement towards top line stability. Any sense as to whether that provides incremental flexibility around the balance sheet and M&A with respect to the rating agencies? And I guess along those lines, can you help us think about how you'd manage potential opportunities for growth, inorganic opportunities for growth, within the context of maintaining IG ratings at both Moody's and Fitch?","R. Stewart Ewing","Brian, I don't think given where Moody's is, and we'll go and talk with them, probably actually after the year ends so that we can talk fully about 2012 and 2013 as well. But I'm not sure that really offers too much flexibility, if you understand where Moody's is with respect to the requirement to get down to their 3x debt to EBITDA using their formula.","Brian Turner","Okay. I mean, I think that they've certainly given a few different parameters and one of them I know was stabilization of the top line, but certainly the balance sheet remains the focus. So I just didn't know if that would give you guys any sense of incremental flexibility to do something, but it sounds like...","Glen F. Post","I don't think it's give us significant incremental flexibility.","Brian Turner","And then I guess the second part, on how you'd think about inorganic opportunities in M&A within that context and how you think about maintaining investment grade versus opportunities out there that may pressure that?","Glen F. Post","We've always valued the investment-grade rating and we still value it. It really depends on the opportunity, what it could do. Future acquisitions should be more -- if we were to make another acquisition in the future, it'd be more focused on an area that could drive growth for us. So we'd have to weigh that opportunity with the issues around credit ratings. We hope we'd find ways to maintain our investment grade credit rating, which we initially do every time we do a transaction now. It's a factor that we consider. So every deal is different.","Operator","I would now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","R. Stewart Ewing","Just one comment to -- someone asked what our required contribution was for pensions for 2013 and I said, a little over $100 million, about $100 million. It's actually about $35 million, the required contribution for 2013.","Glen F. Post","Thank you, Stewart. And thank you, Saeed. We are pleased with the continued progress we made during the third quarter towards stabilizing the top line revenues and believe our continued investment in key strategic opportunities will help us continues to drive growth both near term and long term. Our strategic revenues continue to grow, and our guidance reflects our expectation that our revenues from strategic services will continue to grow in the months ahead. We also remain focused on ensuring operating costs align with our revenue mix and on achieving our operating expense synergy targets through the successful completion of the Qwest and Savvis integrations. Additionally, the expansion of our Prism TV service later this year and the recent launch of managed hosting and cloud services for small and mid-sized business customers will further strengthen our product portfolio and provide us additional revenue growth opportunity as we look into 2013.

Reconciliation between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at ir.centurylink.com.","And now as you turn to slide 4, your host for today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen today will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer. And also available during the question-and-answer portion of today's call will be Dean Douglas, CenturyLink's President of Sales and Marketing.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through May 12, 2016, and a webcast replay of our call will be available through May 27, 2016. Anyone listening to a taped or a webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of May 4, 2016, and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","So now as we move to slide 5, I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our first quarter results and operational initiatives, as well as provide guidance for next quarter.","Beginning on slide six, our first quarter 2016 results were solid. Core revenue, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share, were all in line with our guidance for the quarter. High bandwidth data services revenue provided to business customers grew more than 7% year-over-year. And consumer strategic service revenues grew approximately 5% year-over-year. Additionally, since the beginning of the year, we successfully placed over $1.2 billion in debt, which we will use primarily to refinance 2016 debt maturities.","Continuing on slide 7, we entered 2016 with a renewed focus on our key objective to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world, whether it's providing network connections or adjacent services on top of that connection. Enabling the power of the digital world to improve our customer's lives and business is really what we are all about.","Obviously, we are operating in a challenging and quickly evolving industry. Customer expectations are growing, technology is rapidly advancing, and we face strong competition on multiple fronts. But change brings opportunity; and we believe we have the assets, the financial strength and the people necessary to deliver critical broadband capabilities and related services our customers require.","Our delivery on this opportunity and our efforts to drive long-term free cash flow growth is anchored in four operational objectives.","Continuing on to slide 8, first, we expect to maximize market penetration of enabled network and adjacent services. The network is our key strategic advantage and is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers. We will leverage our localized marketing initiatives to drive penetration of the investments we've made to-date in GPON and other broadband technologies; and we will drive further penetration of our fiber-enabled, multi-tenant, commercial buildings and businesses.","As of quarter end, we have over 1.5 million fiber-enabled homes and businesses with Internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. And we provide more than 30% of our addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher; a speed that today in the market is sufficient to address most of our customer's actual needs.","Additionally, we remain committed to enhancing our sales through partnerships with major software, computer and technology companies and with our large alternative partner channel. It is also important for us to be more aggressive in our customer and revenue retention efforts, as the cost of acquiring new customers is typically much higher than retaining current customers.","Our second operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. We've always operated with a customer-centric focus, but we know there are ways we can improve our customer experience. We're simplifying our product offerings; and within our existing capital programs, we're investing to drive higher levels of automation and self-service under our service delivery platforms.","We expect the outcome of these improvements to enhance the products and services that we deliver to our customers. We expect them to reduce our overall delivery timeframes, as well as improve our managed services delivery and service model.","Continuing on to slide nine, our third operational initiative is to invest with discipline and with a focus on network first. We believe the greatest potential returns on our capital investment are in building and delivering broadband service and capacity in our markets. We will focus our investment on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity to our customers. And we will further enhance our core network access capabilities for consumers with a variety of network enablement techniques, including bonding, vectoring and further deploying fiber to the home.","Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital intense, high growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services such as managed network and hosting, cloud, IT services and video, along with over the top applications and content.","We believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services our customers want, while also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the network service offerings that are at the heart of our customer relationships.","Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know that our long-term success will require ongoing realignment of our legacy cost structure. Realizing those efficiencies and ensuring our capital is aligned to those investments that will drive the highest returns is crucial to driving CenturyLink's future cash flow \u2013 our cash flow growth. Through aggressive simplification and automation of our product portfolio and customer experience, not only will we enhance service to our customers, we'll also drive cost out of our business and operate more efficiently.","Also, we're focused on increasing the discipline and rigor of our capital allocation process to generate the best returns on our capital and operating investments. An example is the strategic review process currently underway for the datacenter and colocation business. While we expect colocation services to continue be a service our customers will look to us for, we believe there's potentially a more efficient way to enable these services for our customers.","We have a clear strategic direction. And we believe by focusing on our key objectives and these key operational initiatives, we will successfully build CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both our customers and our shareholders.","Moving to slide 10, there remains tremendous demand for colocation services in both the U.S. market, as well as the international markets we operate in. While we like the colocation business, we believe our priority for capital investments is in the network to protect and grow our consumer and business network market positions.","Therefore, we launched the strategic review process for our datacenter and colocation business last year. Our strategic review is ongoing. We have received a strong level of interest from numerous strategic and financial parties. We expect to start narrowing this down to a shorter list over the next few weeks; and we expect to finalize the process in late third or early fourth quarter of this year.","This strategic review could result in a sale of all or a portion of the datacenters. It could result in a partnership or a joint venture, as well as possibly keeping these assets as part of CenturyLink's portfolio. In all cases, we look for the best way to create accretive value for CenturyLink and our shareholders and continue to provide a strong colocation competitor in the market for our customers.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart to discuss our financial results and guide us in the liquidity position. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Glenn. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the quarter, provide an overview of second quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon, and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position.","Now moving to slide 12, I will review a few highlights from our first quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing the results, excluding special items, as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules. As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid results for the first quarter, and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis; a 1.1% decrease from first quarter 2015 operating revenues.","The decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy and low bandwidth data services revenue, offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high-cost support revenues due to CAF Phase 2 higher consumer strategic services and increased high-bandwidth data services revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.98 billion for the first quarter; a decrease of 1.9% from a year-ago period.","Strategic revenues grew 1.5% year-over-year, primarily driven by strengthened high-speed data revenues, high-speed Internet and Prism TV. In the first quarter, we added approximately 16,900 Prism TV customers, while high-speed Internet customers increased nearly 7,800 during the quarter. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.69 billion for the first quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 38.4%. Cash expenses for the first quarter declined $5 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs.","Starting in the first quarter of 2016, we've revised our free cash flow calculation to include the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, as well as stock-based compensation. We believe this calculation provides additional detail and insight into the company's ongoing cash requirements.","For first quarter of 2016, free cash flow was $824 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.71, an increase from $0.67 in the first quarter of 2015. Although operating cash flow declined in the first quarter of 2016, compared to first quarter of 2015, lower depreciation and the impact of our share buybacks in 2015 resulted in a net increase in adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Moving to slide 13 and our business segment, in the first quarter, the business segment generated $2.6 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $93 million or 3.4% from the same period a year ago. First quarter strategic revenue for the segment was flat at $1.58 billion, compared to first quarter 2015, driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, being offset by the declines in low-bandwidth data services and hosting revenues.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.9% from first quarter a year ago, due to primarily a continuing decline in voice and switched access revenues. Total business segment expenses decreased $36 million or 2.5% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related cost.","Now turning to slide 14, the Consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues; a slight decrease of $8 million or 0.5% from first quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 4.9% year-over-year to $774 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 5.8% from first quarter 2015, as voice revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.6%, compared to the same period a year ago due primarily to higher Prism TV content cost and marketing expenses.","Now turning to our guidance on slide 15, for the second quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.38 billion to $4.43 billion; core revenues of $3.94 billion to $3.99 billion; and operating cash flow between $1.59 to $1.64 billion; adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.57 to $0.62.","Second quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be in line with first quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high-bandwidth data services, high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues, being offset by the expected declines in legacy and low-bandwidth data services revenues.","Our anticipated sequential decrease in second quarter operating cash flow compared to first quarter 2016 is primarily due to expected higher seasonal cash expenses. For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although continued pressure on business strategic revenues and our decision to defer certain price increases will likely result in our core and total revenue coming in toward the lower half of our range for the year that we previously provided.","Now turning to slide 16, and as we discussed last quarter, our liquidity position remains very strong. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed debt issuances for a total of over $1.2 billion, which will be used to refinance substantially all of our 2016 maturities. Our 2017 maturities are comparable to the amount in 2016; and as you can see, the following three years' maturities are materially lower.","As indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash flow, which should result in our dividend payout ratio for full year 2016 to be in the low to mid-60% range. So our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","That concludes the prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thanks very much. Good evening. Stewart, I wonder if we could come back to that last comment on the revenue guidance for 2016. You cited pressure on business services revenues and for price increases. Can you just go through that in a little more detail and how that relates to your path to revenue stability? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. So, Simon, if you take our first quarter actual results and the midpoint of second quarter guidance, you'll see that if you \u2013 leaving the annual guidance where it is, you'll see that we would require to have revenue growth in the last half of the year to be able to get to the midpoint of guidance. So we think we'll be in the bottom half of guidance based on the things I mentioned.","In terms of the business strategic revenues, we've seen some weakness in MPLS revenues, as well as our hosting revenues. We expect to be able to turn that around and grow these revenue streams later in the year. But at this point, based on where we are, we think that we need to give you guidance that \u2013 or indicate that will be towards the lower half of the guidance.","The other part, I guess, is the price increases. Some of the increases that we were going to put in place, probably in the $40 million range, we've decided at least to defer at this point. We're still talking about them. But we feel it's fair to call that out as a possibility that we'll not implement those increases. Some of our...","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What products were those on?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","They were really across the board, but mostly directed towards high-speed Internet for facility charges and things like \u2013 of that nature.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And the pressure in business, is that competition or macro or...","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","I think we're winning. I'm going to let Dean talk about that a little bit.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","Okay, sure. Some of the pressures that we're facing in the business have to do with a slight adjustment in strategy. For example, in the high-speed Internet realm, what we did was we pivoted from a approach that was pure broadband to one that is more traditional bundled broadband. We did that in the latter part of fiscal year 2015, and so we're starting to work through what that means in the first part of fiscal year 2016. And we expect that that will continue to work through through the middle part of the year, fiscal year 2016.","But that pivot to the more traditional approach to high-speed bandwidth in the Consumer segment especially should allow us to have customers that have less proclivity to churn and a higher ARPU. So we think that that's going to be something that we're going to benefit from in the second half of the year and into 2017.","On the high-speed \u2013 or I'm sorry, the MPLS circuits and the Ethernet circuits for the business marketplace, we actually are doing pretty well with that. In the first quarter it's generally slower than we see in the second quarter and other quarters throughout the year; and we saw that once again in the first quarter of this year.","Having said that, we did focus on driving our business and market approach from a enterprise standpoint to really take advantage of opportunities that we think are much nearer term. And so, we're focused on those nearer-term opportunities; and you should start to see those near-term opportunities manifest themselves in the second half of the year.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd point out too, Simon, on the business services, the MPLS and Ethernet, we had good \u2013 we said 7% growth, we just expected more. We wanted it to be higher than the 7%. So it's growing. It's just we expected to see that level pick up in the latter half of the year.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","That's absolutely the case.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. Just following up on Simon's question on sort of the 2016 outlook, does that sort of change the trajectory in terms of your expectation for stabilization in the top line? And then I've got a bit of a follow-up question, if I may.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. I think we can still get close, if not get there. And the other thing that we're going to do is work on the expense side as well to try to make sure that we keep our operating cash flow more towards the midpoint of the guidance that we've provided.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. And then on the initiatives around the datacenter assets, you had mentioned we should think about sort of a wrap up around the Q3 or Q4 timeframe, if I'm not mistaken. How should we think about the primary use of cash once that comes in? And at this point, you had mentioned that you've seen a lot of interest. You had mentioned in the past that you'd be open to a sale or a potential JV or other opportunities. Has there been sort of an area that a lot of this interest is focused on? Is it a sale, or how should we think about that?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the last part, Amir. There has been more focus on the sale from interested parties. There are some who are proposing possible joint ventures. We expect in the next two weeks to have those structures available to us. They are really due next week. And when we have that, we'll know more about not only the structures and the partnership opportunities versus a sale, but also the level of interest in terms of valuation.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","In terms of the use of proceeds, we're going to wait until we get closer to understanding what that might be. But basically one option is to \u2013 if we do dispose of the properties and the business, our EBITDA will be reducing; and we want to try to keep our debt to EBITDA ratio at about 3 times. So we may repay a certain amount of the debt that we have outstanding over a period of time.","The other opportunity that we'll look at is to look at \u2013 to the extent that business is generating free cash flow, to potentially look at a share buyback to mitigate the negative impact of any free cash flow per share that would be associated with the disposal of that business. And then we'll look at investing in our business as well, potentially the network to try to drive our speeds faster and drive more customers to the network.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the additional color.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first, just a short-term kind of picture. Stewart, if I go line by line through the strategic services, legacy services data integration quarter-over-quarter, the businesses that are declining went down $88 million; and the businesses that grew, grew $14 million for a negative $74 million sequential. And the guidance range suggests that that goes from minus $74 million to a range of minus $20 million to plus $30 million, so that like a plus $100 million swing is in the realm of possibility. If you could kind of walk us through kind of these line items and tell us where all these big changes are conceivably coming from, I think it would give people a little bit more conviction about what's supposed to happen next quarter.","And then longer term, obviously one of the big questions a lot of people have is couple of years ago you guys were looking into the future, saw mid-80% types of payout ratios in your future as a full cash taxpayer and you decided to cut the dividend. And people are doing the math now. They're looking into the future. They're seeing bonus tax depreciation reverse and payouts going at least into the mid-70%s, and there's fears that you guys are going to go back and cut the dividend again because that's what you did last time. Could you kind of talk about that issue as well? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, let me \u2013 Stewart is pulling the line item information, and I'll just talk about the dividend issue. Dividend is a key part of the value proposition that we have for shareholders. And there's no guarantee, but I know our board and management team feels like we're very much committed to the dividend. And we think with additional approval of bonus depreciation, you look at our \u2013 even though the payout ratios are going up, we believe we're going to certainly have adequate free cash flow to continue the dividend. So I can tell you, our board has not discussed reducing the dividend. I think it'd never happen. But we're committed to our dividend; again, a primary factor in our value proposition to shareholders, so we're committed to that dividend.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. And the other thing that we've said as well, David, on the dividend is that versus where we were a few years ago when we reduced the dividend, as long as we can see a path to EBITDA stability and EBITDA growth down the road, it's okay for our dividend payout ratio to float up higher than we talked about before.","In terms of the increase in the strategic services and what that implies, basically a fair amount of that is due to rate increases that we've put in and expect to put in in the second quarter of the year. So that's driving quite a bit of it. The rest of it is due to unit increases that we expect to see in our IPTV products, as well as our high-speed Internet products.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Did we lose you, Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. No, in general, that's pretty much it. I can't really go line by line. But just in general, it's basically price increases on those products, predominantly high-speed Internet.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And so, your comments earlier about not putting through some price increases, there are in fact some other price increases that are going in?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yes. There are other price increases. Of the total amount that we expected to do and that we kind of baked into our guidance that we gave for the full year at the end of the fourth quarter, we chose to not do about $40 million of the total amount. But there are other price increases that are going in and have gone in sometime during the first quarter, as well as we expect to put in throughout really the second quarter, the third quarter, that will drive some of the revenues in the back half of the year.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","David, and just a little more color on the revenue. We've got the rapidly expanding GPON markets. We've gone up again. Now we're up at 1.5 million homes and businesses we're passing. With the exclusion of the last couple of hundred thousand, I know we were at 21% penetration at the end of March. And we just started with the last year with that GPON work, so we believe there's significant upside going forward with those GPON markets, as well as the new Prism markets, we entered just late last year a number of those markets.","So that along with the MVU and MTU focus we have now, we've got fiber to a number of MVUs, MTUs that are going to help drive revenues. So we think there's really upside here in the last half of the year to drive greater penetration, as Stewart said, additional revenue there.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. And we think our MPLS revenues will grow in the back half of the year based on the installations that we can do of customers that we have sold and expect to sell, as well as our IT services business is small, but it's growing and contributing to expected revenue growth in the back half the year as well.","David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, great. Thanks for the color, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Niknam from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. Just two, if I could. First, on consumer broadband. So revenues were effectively flat sequentially. Can you just give us some more color on what's driving that slower growth? And then just bigger picture on your asset mix, if you think about the business over the long-term, are there areas you think you may need greater scale to begin competing more effectively? Then conversely, are there other opportunities like the colo business where you may not necessarily need ownership or where you'd look to maybe move away from over time? Thanks.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","So let me take the first part of the question, which is with regard to the consumer broadband business. As I mentioned earlier, in the second half of last year, we actually pivoted from a model where we focused on pure broadband to move to a more traditional broadband mix. And so, as we do that, we've moved the marketing funds from focus on pure broadband to taking on the more traditional broadband or bundled broadband kinds of services. And so, we expect that business to recover, as I mentioned, in the second half of the year, because we'll still see some marketing spend and investment in marketing that we need to do to drive that broadband business.","So we're seeing it flat sequentially, but we don't think that the business is going to be flat sequentially based upon where we're focused and the drive we have. And, as I mentioned and I'll reiterate, it does drive a churn model that's significantly lower than the churn model that we would see in the pure broadband. So not only would we get new customers going forward with the marketing efforts we have in place to drive the traditional broadband business, but we'll also retain more of those customers that we drive to that business model as well.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matthew, I'll just talk about asset mix for a moment. As I pointed earlier on the sale of the colo, it's really a matter of really prioritizing where we're going to invest our capital, where we think we can drive the best returns. We think there are ways to increase our revenue, drive revenue using partners and different technologies such as over the top technologies for, what we call, our asset light businesses, the hosting and IT services, those types of business that we believe that we can drive growth in.","But there's some functionality we would like to have. I don't think the scale was necessarily the issue here, as you asked, but I think it is some functionality that we would like to gain, that we think there's some opportunities out there to do that.","On the network side, we think we have great scale there and we'll just continue to invest in GPON, in higher-speed, at vectoring and bonding, and we think we can drive a lot of opportunity throughout our market for the broadband growth and Prism growth as well. So that's really our focus there. And we think we have a real opportunity to drive both the returns as well as the revenue growth over time with the asset base we have.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. Can you comment on special access, what's sort of your net exposure there and thoughts on some of the action that the FCC is taking? And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks about better investments in your network versus where the data center opportunity is there. Where do you see the highest returns in investing your network and where are you going to be placing your CapEx over the next 12 months?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Frank, so this week the FCC concluded its special access tariff investigation, and really that will have a minimal financial impact and, in fact, tariff impacts to us as well. And, of course, they opened a special access notice to a full (36:02) rulesmaking that could potentially impose more regulations, special access pricing terms and conditions. It appears that the FCC is seeking to impose additional price regulation on the industry, as well as redefining what constitutes a competitive market between the market participants.","The most concerning financial issue in the proceeding, as we appreciate it at this point, is the potential imposition of a productivity factor or an X factor that could require CenturyLink to lower its special access rates on an annual basis. We believe the market for high-bandwidth data services is highly competitive, as evidenced by the fact that we're not getting all the special access, it's going away and converting to Ethernet. The cable companies get some, the fiber companies get some, CLECs gets some. So there's plenty of competition.","And we don't believe that heavy handed regulation, including an arbitrary market and bandwidth definitions, as well as unwarranted price regulation, we think that that will only serve to just hinder further investment in broadband, especially in rural areas where it's tough to make the investment work anyway. So we don't know what the outcome will be at this point and really haven't been able to quantify the financial impacts because, again, we really don't know where they're going to end up from the standpoint of having a productivity factor or X factor or not.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Can you tell us what sort of your net exposure is between special access revenue versus any cost you have for network \u2013 for access?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","I mean, it's the wholesale revenue basically and it's high margin, Frank. So there aren't a lot of continued incremental expenses associated with providing that service. It's mostly in the investment that was required to build the service out. There's some maintenance cost, but it's probably pretty minimal.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Well, there's also costs you have, say, in outside of your region where you're buying special access is what I was getting to.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","That's true. And that would...","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","You would benefit on the cost side as well.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","That would be a benefit on the cost side, as well, Frank. And we haven't really been able to quantify that either. And frankly, I'm not sure exactly the relationship now between what we spend with our third parties versus our revenue. I think when we looked at this in years past, basically there was some benefit, but the benefit wasn't enough to offset the potential reduction; and especially this time when they may bifurcate the special access between urban areas and rural areas. So you really just don't know what they'll end up doing there and what the implications would be to us until we really get a better understanding and get more detail and have the notice of proposed rulesmaking and reply comments made and all. I think then we'll have a better feel, maybe towards the end of the third quarter or so.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And on the network investment focus?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. In terms of our network, I mean, we believe our best returns come from where we're increasing the speed availability in the network that allows us to be more competitive with the cable companies and others that provide high-bandwidth data services and Internet services. So that's where our best opportunity is, I believe. And we'll continue to really do the things that we need to do to improve our network and improve the speeds that our customers are able to take advantage of on our network. We have quite a bit of work going on really starting a year or so ago, really spearheaded by Aamir Hussain, our CTO, in terms of really increasing the \u2013 and really utilizing and getting more life out of the old copper network.","So we realize fiber is the way to go and is a good way to go when you can afford it from a density standpoint. But we believe there's a lot of life left in the copper network and a lot of things we can do with bonding and vectoring and other technologies that are coming down the pipe that will help us be able to stay competitive and enhance the experience that our customers receive.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just to give you an example of that, Frank. If you look at just where we have a GPON investment in the last year or so, we've got 20% penetration already in those GPON markets that have been there for several months. So it's really encouraging. And also, where we got the vectoring, now we're seeing great take rates there. So we really have, especially in the \u2013 well, it's really both, but especially in the business side, we have very little market share from a data revenue standpoint in our legacy markets. And as we roll out the GPON capabilities as well as the vectoring type capabilities in these large and mid-sized markets, we're seeing really good success. And that's why we believe in the second half of the year we're going to see better growth than we've seen in a while in MPLS, the Ethernet type services.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. Just three quick ones. Can you give some examples of what you mean by more advanced broadband services or more bundled broadband services? Also, how does your ARPU \u2013 maybe you can talk about your broadband average ARPU and maybe how does that compare to your competitors?","And then third, can you just give us a sense of how deep the fiber is in the network at this point? It seems like vectoring and a bunch of these other technologies, you've got to get down to a couple of thousand feet. And I know you talked about 1.5 million homes passed with GPON, and maybe where are you in terms of dollar amounts of fiber deployment a year or some other metric to give us a sense of where we can get to a point where the broadband speeds are really more comparable to the cable companies? Thanks.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","All right. So let's talk about the examples of what we mean by bundled broadband services. So the traditional high-speed Internet services are really what you'd expect in the double play or triple play. So it's not only high-speed, but it's also video and some voice technology as well. And so that's pretty much a typical broadband suite of services.","When you look at the Prism adds that we did in the first quarter of this year, 53% of them were with new customers. So you're now starting to see services like Prism attract new customers that were not customers of CenturyLink; and they're dragging along broadband services with that video play. So 98% of those customers that signed up for Prism in the first quarter also signed up for our broadband services.","And so, we see in those markets that bundling the technologies, broadband, video and the like, really do provide a much more compelling offering for both our customer base, as well as the folks that were with either competitors or didn't have the service at all, but nonetheless were not customers of CenturyLink.","And so, as we think about how we go forward to the marketplace, we obviously do a lot of competitive analysis. So I would tell you that our ARPUs are consistent with what you'd see from an ARPU level in our competitors. And we see competition adding a lot of fees, and so that's where there might be a little bit of a delta. But we're working through and constantly monitoring what our competitors are doing in the marketplace with regard to the average ARPUs in our business.","The fiber deployment, well, we talked about fiber deployment. 1.5 million homes passed from a fiber standpoint. But vectoring and bonding does provide a compelling level of service for many of our customers, especially those that don't have access to fiber or where they really don't need the speed of fiber.","And so, there's obviously an economic equation there for those customers, but also it's, at 40 megabytes, sufficient enough to get Prism services and to do a lot of broadband activity that they're going to need in the consumer space, especially. And so, they should be very, very comfortable with what we have to offer; and I think they are comfortable with what we have to offer when we do the vectoring and the bonding in order to provide them high-speed broadband access.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tim, I may just add on the vectoring. Today, we only have about 250,000 households passed. We expect to be close to 600,000 by year end. And we're looking at a plan that could reach over 14 million households over the next few years. And it's costing about $160 per home passed of vectoring, but it's getting 100 megabits out here too and it can be more than that. But certainly 100 megabits is very possible at vectoring that we believe can cover a lot of our customer's needs over the next few years.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","So are you basically saying you can reach a vast majority of your homes passed with vectoring with 100 megabits in a few years?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can reach the majority of the addressable homes passed, as we describe it, where we have \u2013 they're occupying and they are addressable with broadband.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That would be a game changer. Good luck. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line's open. Please go ahead.","Forrest Wilson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys. It's Forrest in for Phil. As you see more over the top video offers coming, does it make sense to stand up your own full video platform in new markets rather than just bundling a DTV\/OTV (46:55) product, for example, with the great broadband speed offering? How do you think about that?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","So we think it's a very, very interesting proposition. And so, we're piloting that capability in four markets, and we're going to evaluate how that plays out in those markets. But we think it's a very, very intriguing opportunity; and we're definitely looking at that as an alternative to some of the other opportunities we have in the video space.","Forrest Wilson - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the conference back over for closing remarks. Mr. Glen Post?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Saeed.

Glen?","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tony. And thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter 2015 results of operations, provide guidance and outlook for the second half 2015. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to highlight a few items that I think are important to keep in mind as we go through our results. First, on the revenue side, our second quarter results were negatively affected by renegotiation of a long-term wholesale agreement that reduced strategic revenue by about $13 million for the quarter and is driving an approximately $40 million reduction on our revenue outlook for full year 2015. This renegotiated agreement locks us into those agreements at market rates for several years, giving us greater ability to grow that business and provide reciprocal access to our wholesale partners network at more attractive rates.","Now we're revising our full year revenue midpoint to $17.8 billion, reflecting the impact of this wholesale issue and the full-year effect of softer-than-expected first half results. Our revised guidance is approximately $45 million below the current consensus Street estimate of $17.85 billion. $40 million of that is associated with the wholesale issue I was just talking about.","However, the bigger issue in the second quarter was really expense. We had a number of non-core items that drove our expenses higher in the quarter, including $20 million in group insurance and pension true-up adjustments and $20 million due to higher-than-expected CPE sales. The balance of our overage is primarily due to not hitting the operating budgets we established for business units for the quarter principally due to higher-than-anticipated employee-related cost. We do not believe this miss reflects anything fundamental in the cost structure of our business. Basically we just didn't get the job done here. We have made a number of key changes and, as we will discuss later, we have put plans in place to address this issue in the second half of the year.","Beyond 2015, we believe we have further opportunity to continue to align the costs in our business to our revenue performance and we will discuss some of this with you later in the call. I wanted to share this with you at the outset of the call as I want to be clear that although our second quarter results did not meet our expectations, I am as confident as I have ever been that we have the assets, the products, the services and the opportunities required to grow our business.","Now if you will turn to slide six, we believe several key priorities would drive the future growth and profitability of our business. The first is to grow business revenues driven principally by increased market penetration of our network, hosting, cloud and IT solution service offerings. With respect to our business network services, we continue to see strong demand from business, wholesale and government customers for high-bandwidth data services, such as Ethernet, MPLS and business GPON, and we're investing in and aligning our operations to take greater advantage of this opportunity.","Now let me give you a few examples of what we're doing. As of June 30, we have made fiber-based GPON available to approximately 475,000 business locations and we expect to add GPON service to another 25,000 businesses by year end. While there is good demand for this product and given our relatively low penetration, we believe we have strong upside with those investments. We also continue to enhance our core network offerings, including next-generation MPLS, Ethernet (6:09) and SIP trunking services, as well as plans to enable software-defined networking and network function virtualization capabilities into 43 data centers by the end of this year.","During the first half of the year, we expanded our global data center footprint through expansions in six markets, adding \u2013 we added 10.8 megawatts of critical capacity and that brings CenturyLink's global data center capacity to more than 185 total megawatts across our 59 data centers. We still have upside in our existing data center investment as we had over 35% of sellable floor space available as of June 30.","Our revenues from our CenturyLink cloud platform is growing rapidly, more than doubling in the last 12 months, actually 138% growth in the second quarter of last year. Our primary focus in the cloud and hosting space is to strengthen our private and dedicated hosting capabilities. These private platforms require much of the automation and management tools you see in major public cloud platforms, but our focus is on leveraging the CenturyLink cloud platform to enhance our enterprise customers' abilities to turn up and manage both network and hosted workloads in private, dedicated environments, including the enablement of bare-metal services later this year.","However, overall, we have not met our expectations in our managed hosting business. I believe our sales force reorganization contributed to this issue. But I believe the principal driver is that in the latter part of 2014 and early 2015, we defocused our delivery of services on our existing managed platform to focus instead on putting workloads on the CenturyLink cloud platform. The CenturyLink cloud platform is a powerful and dynamic platform but does not yet support all of the functionality our managed hosting customers require. The defocus away from legacy platform was a misstep that has affected our hosting results and we believe we can improve these results by refocusing on delivering services and increasing capabilities on our legacy platform, while we continue to enhance the depth of CenturyLink cloud capabilities.","Finally, we are also seeing good interest in our IT services and data analytics service offerings. Our focus in this area is to provide targeted services to business customers who are underserved by the traditional larger system integrators. Although growing rapidly, this business is small in scale today, but the service offerings give us a good low capital-intensive opportunity to engage at the C level and generate leads in the other parts of our business. Now this capability to provide differentiated end-to-end solutions, including IT consulting, has led to a number of recent wins for CenturyLink to provide a large portion or in some cases all communications, data and IT services for those customers.","Overall, in our Business segment, we have to improve our execution, but we are seeing strength in our sales momentum. For example, second quarter 2015 sales to our enterprise customers were up 10% from first quarter 2015 and up 16% from second quarter 2014 while our commercial sales increased 27% from second quarter of 2014.","Continuing on now to slide seven, and turning to the Consumer segment, we continue to see good results from those markets we have deployed high broadband speeds and Prism TV services. Specifically in our GPON markets, the take rates continue to be strong and are exceeding our expectations. And because GPON is such a great driver of demand and penetration, we continue to expand our gigabit footprint ending the quarter with more than 600,000 households and 16 markets having access to gigabit speeds. We expect to have gigabit service available to approximately 700,000 households by year-end 2015 with plans of further expansion thereafter.","We're also trialing technologies that enable up to 200 megabit over legacy copper networks. This is in the early stages, but it is showing good promise. We also expanded our Prism TV service in the second quarter, turning up service in Portland, Salt Lake and Minneapolis. We added a total of 175,000 addressable homes in the second quarter, ending the quarter with over 2.6 million Prism TV addressable households. We anticipate expanding Prism TV service to approximately 250,000 additional households during the remainder of 2015 and to reach more than 2.8 million total Prism TV addressable homes by year end.","In addition, we're developing an over-the-top offering that will provide a robust competitive video offering for customers both within and outside our Prism TV market footprint. And finally, we're tightening our credit policies for our Internet-only customers to reduce sales to customers who tend to change Internet providers frequently leaving unpaid balances when they exit.","Now while we expect this change to negatively impact consumer broadband net subscriber additions through the remainder of 2015, we anticipate this adjustment will actually help improve our broadband growth in 2016 due to lower churn. Now this move is unrelated to and will no impact on our marketing initiative for lower income consumers under CenturyLink's Internet Basics program. We remain totally committed to offering affordable broadband access to lower-income households across our broadband service areas.","Now I want to discuss our thoughts around expense control. As I noted above, the principal issue for us this quarter was that our expenses were about $80 million more than we anticipated. About half of that amount is attributable to not managing costs for established budgets. We can and we will do better on this front. For starters, we're implementing plans to reduce planned operating expenses by approximately $125 million in the second half of 2015, including lowering contract labor and professional services cost, a reduction in the number of employees and other expense reductions. Now this is not simply a target. We already have plans in place to address most of that number.","Also independent of any issue around second quarter expense, earlier this year we established a dedicated team whose sole purpose is to identify and drive ongoing efficiencies into our business. This team is reviewing every major process and every significant system to validate its business purpose and whether there is a faster, better way to achieve that objective.","An early example of their work is a recent success in improving certain service intervals by more than 40% by streamlining processes. This will lead to a better customer experience, the need for fewer employees to perform that work, and better margins on that business. We believe there are other opportunities similar to this as well as the opportunity to improve efficiencies by driving additional automation and simplification into our business.","Continuing on to slide eight now. Lastly I'd like to take a minute to discuss our philosophy around our dividend. Given that our path to revenue and EBITDA growth is taking longer than we originally anticipated and that our cash taxes are expected to increase significantly in 2016, we understand that markets focus on the sustainability of our dividend. So I want to be clear here. While no company can credibly say they will never cut their dividend, we see the dividend as a fundamental part of our overall value proposition to shareholders.","We believe the most financially prudent way to manage our business is to balance our investment velocity with our EBITDA performance so that we can sustain a reasonable return of cash to shareholders while positioning the company for long-term growth. We believe we have a number of opportunities to manage our business in a way that supports the dividends as we work to capitalize on our growth prospects. First, we have made significant investments in our network and data center infrastructure over the last several years and believe we have the flexibility to lower our planned capital budget by about $200 million to approximately $2.8 billion for full year 2015 without significantly affecting our path to growth.","Also, as I noted above, we have instituted plans to reduce our expense outlook by $125 million in 2015. And we have ongoing opportunities to increase efficiencies through automation, simplification and increased focus.","However, we believe the most important thing we can do to sustain the dividend over the long term is to continue our path to revenue and EBITDA stability and growth. As I discussed above, we believe we have very good opportunities to grow our business through driving greater penetration of products and services we enabled over the last several years as well as implementing new services and capabilities we're in the process of rolling out.","So the point I would like to leave you with is, despite the wholesale issues in 2015 and lower-than-expected growth in certain of our strategic products, we believe we have the ability to grow our business and to balance our pursuit of growth with our ability to sustain our dividend. And our view is that managing our business to do this is a fundamental element of our value proposition to shareholders.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Stewart.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter and full year 2015 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Beginning on slide 10, I'll review some highlights from our second quarter results. I'll be reviewing these results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release and associated financial schedules. Operating revenues were $4.42 billion on a consolidated basis, a 2.7% decline from second quarter 2014 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.02 billion for the second quarter, a decline of 2% from the year-ago period. Strategic revenues grew 1.9% year-over-year and represent 53% of total revenues compared to 50% a year ago. Strength in strategic products such as high-speed Internet, high-bandwidth data and Prism TV continue to drive this growth as we added approximately 8,400 Prism TV customers during the second quarter.","Based on our revised go to-market strategy for consumer broadband that Glen discussed earlier, we'd expect HSI net adds to be negative for the second half of the year. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.62 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 36.8%. Year-over-year cash expenses were up primarily due to higher employee benefits, Prism TV and other costs which were partially offset by lower Customer Premise Equipment costs related to lower data integration revenues.","Free cash flow was $562 million for the quarter. As a reminder, free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest, capital expenditures along with other income. Our solid cash flows continue to provide us with the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.55. As we've discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain noncash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.","Additionally, under the $1 billion share repurchase program, we repurchased 2.5 million shares for an investment of $90 million during the second quarter. Under the current program started in second quarter 2014, we have repurchased over 12 million shares for approximately $460 million. Our level of share repurchases during the second quarter was lower than prior quarters due to strategic opportunities that prevented us from being in the market for several weeks and our being in a closed window period since late in the quarter. Having moved past those strategic opportunities, we expect to continue to be opportunistic in completing this program within the 24-month period and we plan to set up a 10b5-1 program in the next few days to facilitate the purchase of shares through our third quarter earnings release date.","Moving to slide 11 and our Business segment. In second quarter, the Business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decreased $129 million or 4.6% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment declined 0.4% to $1.6 billion from second quarter 2014, driven by the declines in low bandwidth data services and wholesale repricing, partially offset by the continued strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and wavelength. We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer market and we see an opportunity for further investment in the small and medium-size business space to improve market share and drive further growth.","Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.7% from second quarter 2014, due primarily to a continuing decline in access lines. Total Business segment expenses increased from the year-ago period, driven primarily by higher employee-related expenses. The segment margin of 42.6% declined from 45.6% a year ago. This decrease was primarily due to the continued decline in Business segment legacy and low bandwidth data services revenue along with the higher operating expenses described.","On slide 12, I'll provide a little more detail on the revenue mix within the Business segment. High-bandwidth data services revenue grew $65 million or 10% year-over-year compared to second quarter 2014 driven by continued strength in sales to enterprise and government customers. While the growth rate remains solid for high-bandwidth services, it is somewhat dampened by slightly slower growth due to wholesale, renegotiated pricing for Ethernet backhaul services with a large carrier customer.","Low bandwidth data services including private line continued to decline in the second quarter. The year-over-year revenue decline of $81 million or 14% was primarily due to wholesale customers' network grooming efforts and migration to fiber-based services that we've experienced over the past year.","We anticipate this level of year-over-year decline to improve over the coming quarters as we cycle through this period of higher disconnects. Hosting revenues declined $10 million or 3% from the prior year, driven primarily by unfavorable foreign currency impact of approximately $6 million, customer credits and lower non-recurring revenue compared to the year ago period. In the second quarter, data integration revenues decreased approximately $44 million or 24% compared to second quarter 2014 driven by lower CPE sales.","Now turning to slide 13, Consumer generated $1.5 billion in total operating revenues, which was flat with the second quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.9% year-over-year to $758 million driven by growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV customers and select price increases.","Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 5.8% from second quarter 2014 as access line and long distance revenue declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $16 million or 2.7% compared to the same period a year ago due to higher Prism TV cost.","Now turning to Slide 14. For third quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.42 billion to $4.47 billion and core revenues of $4.02 billion to $4.07 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.62 billion to $1.67 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.53 to $0.58. Our anticipated sequential increase in third quarter operating revenues, core revenues and operating cash flow compared to the second-quarter results is primarily driven by growth in strategic services and select price increases. As outlined in our press release, we've revised our full year 2015 guidance to reflect year-to-date results as well as updated expectations for the remainder of the year.","For full year 2015, we expect operating revenues of $17.7 billion to $17.9 billion and core revenues of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion. Both have been lowered reflecting first half 2015 actual results along with continued pressure in wholesale private line, hosting and CPE revenues along with the wholesale repricing previously mentioned. Operating cash flow is projected to be $6.7 billion to $6.85 billion and capital expenditures are projected to be approximately $2.8 billion or $200 million lower than our previous guidance of approximately $3 billion.","As you know, on April 29, the FCC offered potential support payments to price cap carriers under Phase 2 of the Connect America Fund program and carriers have until August 27 of this year to notify the FCC of their intention to accept or forego the support in some or all of the eligible states. CenturyLink was offered up to $514 million in support across 35 states, and at this time, we expect to accept at least $300 million of the available support. We continue to evaluate the remaining support payments and expect to notify the FCC on or before the August 27 deadline.","We expect the FCC to begin distributions under the CAF 2 program in September or October of this year timeframe, and expect the initial receipts to include incremental support that trues up the full-year CAF 2 support we ultimately decide to accept to the full year frozen federal USF support that we received today.","We expect minimal capital investments in 2015 related to CAF 2 due to the timing of the program, but we do expect a full year of CAF 2-related capital expenditures for 2016. We currently expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be approximately $3 billion inclusive of CAF 2 requirements because of the significant investments we have made over the last several years that support our business plans for growth and position us to reallocate capital to CAF 2.","While any receipts from CAF 2 are not included in updated guidance I discussed earlier, we do provide estimated ranges of the potential impact on third quarter and full year 2015 guidance from the CAF Phase 2 support we ultimately accept and receive. We expect to recognize the full amount of CAF 2 support payments as other revenue in the year received.","While we understand the recent area of focus for investors has been whether CenturyLink might implement some type of REIT restructure, we've elected not to pursue that structure at this time for several reasons. These reasons include the complexity and disruption of the transaction structure, the variety of opinions from investors, and a lack of confidence at implementing such a structure would create real long-term shareholder value.","Let me talk a little bit about cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, we expect 2015 cash taxes to be $25 million to $125 million after considering approximately $150 million to $250 million of 2015 taxes that we expect to pay in March of next year. For 2016, we expect cash taxes to increase to the $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion range, including the deferral of the 2015 cash taxes into 2016 that I just mentioned.","Recently, the Senate Finance Committee passed a bill out of committee that would extend the provisions that expired at the end of 2014, including bonus depreciation retroactively for 2015 and through 2016. This two-year bill was meant to push the issue beyond next year's elections. The Finance Committee bill has not yet been considered by the full Senate. The full House has currently extended some selective extenders similar to what they did last year. Bonus depreciation has traditionally been one of these favored selective provisions. Congress went into their August recess last week and the House and the Senate this week, so we don't expect any action on extenders at least until the fall.","In the fall, we currently expect there to be negotiations on all the extenders, but given the support for bonus depreciation, we believe there's a very good chance that it gets extended for at least two years through 2016. Should bonus depreciation get implemented only for 2015, we would expect our 2015 cash taxes to be approximately $25 million to $125 million and 2016 cash taxes between $550 million and $650 million after considering approximately $225 million to $300 million of 2016 taxes that we would expect to pay in March of 2017.","If bonus depreciation is extended through 2016, we expect our cash taxes would decrease by an additional $50 million to $150 million for 2016. So bonus depreciation can have a tremendous effect on our free cash flow.","That concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir.

Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, we kind of gathered from the Analyst Day, it was going be a tough quarter. So thanks, Glen, for kind of giving us that frank rundown.","I guess, Stewart, the way we're now set up with kind of in the middle of the third quarter, the revenue and EBITDA guidance you're giving us kind of in a worst case scenario says that we're going to see flat revenues and rising margins and at the midpoint of the guidance, it suggests we're going to see some pretty strong quarter-on-quarter acceleration in revenues and EBITDA growth heading into 2016. And I guess that that's going to be the big focus for kind of Glen's point about execution and such. So if we go to that page 12, which is really I think on the business services side and we look at that chart, can you kind of walk us through the pieces parts that are going to drive what you seem to think at this stage can still be strong revenue growth kind of heading into the back part of the year and into next? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. So, David, part of what's going happen is, one, we have adjusted some of our wholesale pricing. We think that we'll start picking up some orders from one of the major carriers that we've not really been picking up over the last four months or so. Additionally, we had a one-time item in the second quarter of about $13 million that we think will improve over the next quarter or two.","And if you look at our EBITDA from the standpoint of third quarter and fourth quarter, particularly in the fourth quarter, we expect to have implemented some of the steps that Glen mentioned. And our expenses actually from third quarter to fourth quarter come down about $100 million or so. So that provides the higher margins that you'll see on the back half of the year. Additionally, we expect the second half of the year to continue to have good growth from the standpoint of our high-speed Internet revenue as well as private line, too, which is on the wholesale side.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So thanks, Stewart. And then, I guess, the second question is just on the CAF 2 piece. So, I guess, if we take out $100 million from the kind of, I guess, $75 million from the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance, we're reiterating the free cash flow guide. So it sounds like with the CAF funding, actually EBITDA and free cash flow estimates will probably end up going up. But there's still this large gap that it seems you need to analyze over the next few weeks. I guess, the key issue for people is going be, is the threshold for accepting this CAF money to make sure that it's accretive to the cash flow profile of the company rather than dilutive, and so that's the number that you're trying to figure out?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. That's what we're working through, David. And really trying to look at the effects on 2016 and 2017 of the CAF 2 monies and we really are studying very hard the cost associated with building the network. And we think if we're able to make some progress there, we can (34:05) CAF 2 monies. Basically the minimum that we outlined in the release today really applies to about 24 states or so, or a couple of dozen states. And there are 11 other states that we're having to study a little bit harder in terms of where we are with respect to the network and how much the build-out would cost associated with those. So we could be slightly cash flow dilutive, but I mean that is what we're trying to solve for.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. You have targeted 2015 as the year of revenue stability. You're not talking about getting to revenue stability long term. Is this something where we think we can see revenue stability in 2016? Or is it going to take longer than that? And then on the dividend, I appreciate the comments around how you're thinking about that and the color on the tax payments. But when you cut your dividend a couple of years ago, you did target or talk about bringing your payout ratio below 60%. So how are you thinking about payout ratios, I guess, on a normalized cash taxes now? And if the dividend payout rises above that level, how do you square those factors? Thanks.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Simon, it's Glen. I'll take the first question regarding revenue stability. First of all, as always, we'll provide guidance for 2016 during our fourth quarter earnings call. But based on the sales funnels we're seeing today, the growth we're seeing in our funnels, the expansion of our GPON and Prism footprint and capabilities, the expected improvement in our cloud and hosting and IT services products, I really believe we're going see revenue stability in 2016, what we're seeing right now.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","And, Simon, in terms of the dividend payout ratio, of course, if we do get bonus depreciation, the dividend payout ratio will be approximately 60% or so in 2016 from what we're seeing today. If we don't get bonus depreciation, really there it kind of depends on how much of the CAF 2 monies that we take and what we're able to do with our capital budget. But we probably, for that one year, 2016, would be in the 90% range or so, but that includes the tax payments of $150 million or so \u2013 $100 million, $150 million that we said we would be deferring to 2016 that really relate to 2015.","So we have a $100 million pension payment scheduled in there as well that's not actually required. So we feel like we have some levers that we can pull to and, of course, our dividend payout ratio this year is only about 45% or so. So we have plenty of room to pay the cash taxes early if we want to get that out of 2016. So, I mean, we really feel pretty comfortable that there are levers that we can pull to get our dividend payout ratio where it needs to be to where there's not a problem with it in 2016. And again assuming we get bonus depreciation even for one year, it brings the 2016 dividend payout ratio down to around 60% range.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. A couple of things. First on the CapEx reduction. Can you expand on what's changing this year? Or can you cut without really impacting the business at this point? And does the $3 billion guidance assume that that follows through in 2016 or are you sort of pushing things out? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Some of the projects that we're looking at that we've actually cut really relate to what we cut that falls in the revenue enablement bucket. Probably about a third of the cut is there. And these are projects that are really more network related, that give us extra capacity, and we can go a little bit longer for that and related to that. And so we don't \u2013 we may need to make some of those next year, but we think we can really pretty safely cut that. So about a third of the $200 million cut is network related. About a third is success based too, which really just reflects the \u2013 although we're making our sales for and bookings for the second quarter were 15% ahead of where they were in the first quarter, they're still really behind where we originally expected them to be when we set our capital budget for 2015. And then another third of the $200 million really comes from furniture, equipment, vehicles and things like that that we just think we can \u2013 not have to do. And some of that really relates to some of the other changes that we're making that Glen mentioned.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And, Phil, I just want to be clear on that. The $200 million we're cutting this year, we do not expect to have to add that to capital budget next year. We won't be doing that, so just to be clear on that.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thanks, guys.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","And again, the $3 billion next year really includes CAF 2. And that's why it would go from, like $2.8 billion to $3 billion. I mean, frankly we're hopeful that next year we could get our capital budget down potentially in the $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion range exclusive of CAF 2.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. So, on the buyback can you remind us what the current authorization is and any thought that the board might accelerate that given your confidence to revenue stability and given where the shares are? And then, can you be just a little bit more specific on the cost items? What exactly are you focused on and is any of this head count related? And how that's going to come out as quickly as you've outlined it?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yes, so Frank so the board authorized in February 2014, $1 billion program. I think I mentioned we're about $540 million or so through that. And it expires in essentially May of 2016 and we would expect to complete the program \u2013 our current plans are to complete the program by the end. As I mentioned we expect to be back in the market next week and set up a 10b5-1 plan to start the process of repurchasing the remaining shares.","With respect to the cuts, about two-thirds or so of the amounts are really related to contract labor and professional services as well as some employee cost and employee benefits. So that's where about two-thirds of it is. The other third is actually down in \u2013 we think network expense as well as property taxes.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Glen, can you just give a little more detail on, I think you mentioned credit policy changes. Just trying to get a sense for, if you're seeing a significant uptick in involuntary churn or is that inside the Prism footprint where you're getting people installed and then sort of abandoning equipment? And then, I guess secondly in giving some thought to your comments regarding over-the-top, Prism TV probably is not as profitable as offering obviously straight broadband although it might have churn reducing benefits and we're seeing AT&T de-emphasizing the U-verse platform. Does it make sense to sort of move away from Prism TV and focus more on developing the over-the-top product and then getting just higher speed data to the homes? Thanks.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mike. On the credit policy change, that's mostly around this broadband and HSI. We ought to be a little bit out on Prism but more to HSI. We're seeing a lot of churn there. No pay churn is hitting us really more than previously. So we are \u2013 that's really the \u2013 it's around high-speed data primarily. We're seeing that issue where we're trying to address it.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And regarding the Prism TV and over-the-top, certainly the programming costs are high on Prism TV. However, if you look at the all-in opportunity there, we bring 52% of the new customers to CenturyLink, 57% are triple play customers and about 97% of those customers have a high-speed data connection. So overall, those are profitable customers for us and we're pleased to get them \u2013 we're working hard on the programming costs as our whole industry is, we think it's really an area that we have to change over time. But we think it is a good product for us and driving revenue and cash flows.","The over-the-top is certainly an opportunity. We have some new products coming out over-the-top that we think will be very profitable and we'll include those with our Prism product as well as in areas we don't have Prism and we think there's opportunity there. You're right. There are higher margins with that over-the-top product. So we're looking forward to offering that.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Glen, just as a quick follow-up, I know in the past you've talked about the sort of time lag or timeframe between revenue stability and EBITDA stability, has that changed in your mind at all?","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I think we still think \u2013 the 18 month is still that we still think that we'll be looking at that 18 month timeframe give or take a few months, but that's still our target. That has not changed.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Mike, one other comment on the over-the-top, it's going to be available to many more households than our Prism TV is available to because you don't need the bandwidth to be able to use the over-the-top product that you need to use the Prism product.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","That's certainly \u2013 the cost to connect I assume is going to be quite a bit lower based upon at least the comments from DISH and Sling TV?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yes.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Question on the margins. It looks like the guidance for the full year is about 38%, but you're going to exit the year at a higher level given the expense cuts that you talked about. How should we think about margins going into 2016? Where do you think that can get to before we see the EBITDA stability some time in 2018? And second question on the wholesale private line, which you mentioned that it's still a drag on revenue growth, can you quantify what percent of the revenues come from that? And do you see any impact from maybe wireless backhaul that offsets some of that pressure going forward?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","So, Batya, on the margins, you're right, about 38%. And as we look out, I mean, if we can get to revenue stability in 2016, as Glen mentioned, and basically continue to control our expenses, we're hopeful that the margins next year wouldn't drop that much from where they are this year. And your second question was?","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Wholesale private line mix.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Yeah. So basically we're seeing upgrades from the carriers in terms of wireless backhaul. It's been a little slower than we expected. And I'll tell you, Bill's here. Bill Cheek's here. I'm going to get him to answer the question for you, Batya.","William E. Cheek - President-Wholesale Markets Group","Yeah. Batya, Bill Cheek. Wholesale revenues is about \u2013 and if you think about wireless backhaul, I think was your question, is about 4% roughly of our total company revenues, so it's really relatively small percentage.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then maybe just another question on CAF. If you decide to take about $300 million from the new fund, how much of the existing $350 million of frozen support will still be available for you?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","So with the states where we \u2013 if all we take is basically are the two dozen states or so that results in about $300 million, there would be about $100 million of frozen support that we would continue to receive. At this point, it just depends on how long it takes the FCC to write the rules for the auction process and put that in place and actually have the auctions. We believe the earliest that would be would be towards the end of 2016, but it could very well go over into 2017, and then we would also have the ability to be able to participate in those auctions as well. So about $100 million of frozen support that we will continue to receive in addition to the $300 million of CAF 2 funds.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question for today comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, guys. It seems like the revenue guidance is kind of calling for that this is the bottom quarterly and should increase the next two quarters. Just so I understand that or do you think it could kind of step down on a quarterly basis again next year. And then on just maybe you can walk through the puts and takes on the dividend payout ratio. I guess, if we get out to 2017 on more of a normalized cash tax rate or normalized tax rate and all the puts and changes that you are seeing in terms of the margins, what do you think the dividend payout ratio will be at that time and how confident are you in that dividend payout ratio?","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","2017, the cash taxes would go up somewhat if bonus depreciation is enacted for 2015 and 2016 and not 2017, then basically cash taxes would go up then, but we still believe that we would be okay and we would be hopeful at that point if we stabilize revenue, we would be stabilizing EBITDA as well. So hopefully that wouldn't be an issue. And you are correct in terms of revenue increasing, basically we expect our strategic revenue to grow somewhat in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and in effect offset the declines that we might see from the legacy services.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. And last, should we think of CAF as more of a one time or temporary or do you think it could be kind of more \u2013 should we think of it as more ongoing and might be offset when the six year is up that it might continue longer term. Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President & Assistant Secretary","Well, we really \u2013 we do believe there will be another program after this program is complete. We are not really sure what the program \u2013 we don't know what the program will be, of course, but we think that there may be some opportunity to continue to get some funding to help serve and provide broadband service to rural America.","Tim K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Showing no further questions at this time, I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen F. Post, III - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Saeed. As we called out today, we are not satisfied with our results for the quarter and we have plans in place to correct that trajectory, but overall I really believe we have the best portfolio of assets we've ever had at CenturyLink. Now it's really about execution. We are taking these assets and leveraging them to drive revenue growth, EBITDA growth and shareholder value over time. And while though there certainly will be some quarterly ups and downs with some bumps in the road along the way, CenturyLink's long-term trajectory in my view is as positive and bright as it's ever been. So thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2015 results, released earlier this afternoon.","The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to Slide 2, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for first quarter and full year 2016 and other outlooks on our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide, as well as in our press release, and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.","Moving to Slide 3, we ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call, contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at ir.centurylink.com.","Now, moving to Slide 4, your host for today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen today will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer. Our call today will be available for telephone replay through February 18, 2016, and the webcast replay of our call will be available through March 3, 2016.","Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of February 10, 2016, and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","Moving now to Slide 5, I will now turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen Post","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today as we discuss our third quarter 2015 results of operations and provide guidance and outlook for the remainder of 2015.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today to discuss our fourth quarter results, make a few remarks about 2015 and discussed 2016 objectives and our guidance.","Beginning on Slide 6, 2015 was really a year of two very different halves for CenturyLink's. In the first half, our sales and revenue trends were softer than we had anticipated. Entering the year during the 2014, as part of our ongoing review of our business, we had identified an opportunity to improve the structure of our sales force and we begin to implement this change in late 2014.","Our sales organization realignment was more complex. It took longer than anticipated in mid-year operating expenses were out of alignment with our revenue outlook for the remainder of 2015. We began to take aggressive corrective action in the second half the year and the benefits of the realignment along with the new leadership began to take hold. We improved our overall sales performance and we increased our sales funnel opportunities and enhanced our revenue trends.","At the same time, we were also successful in taking cost out of the business. We reduced planned operating expenses in the second half of 2015, but more than $125 million than the $125 million target we had set in August. These actions helped us deliver very strong results in the fourth quarter, revenues, cash flows and adjusted earnings per share, all exceeded expectations for the quarter.","As we will highlight in more detail later in the call, we saw good performance from our consumer segment during the quarter. Growth in Prism TV customers, along with higher average revenue per customer drove year-over-year consumer revenue growth. Also, for fourth-quarter, business high bandwidth data services grew approximately 9% year-over-year. Overall, we achieved significant improvements in the second half 2015, compared to the first half of the year.","Continuing on now to Slide 7, we also continue to focus on driving higher speeds across our network as we enter 2015 with 940,000 GPON addressable households and 490,000 GPON addressable businesses and we provided more than 30% of our service area addressable units with speeds of 40 megabits or higher. We believe that is the speed that in the marketplace is sufficient to address most of our customers' actual needs. Additionally, we completed our $1 billion share repurchase authorization in early December, and we returned a total of $2 billion to CenturyLink's shareholders in 2015 through dividends and share repurchases. ","As you know in early November, we had announced we were beginning a strategic review process of our data centers and colocation business. This decision is made as part of our continued efforts to proactively manage our portfolio of assets, to best position the Company to compete, to achieve profitable growth and drive our shareholder value.","We made good progress with process. Since our November announcement, we have established a separate data center\/colocation organization, including a separate management team. We are also nearly complete with carve-out [ph] financial statements for our data centers in collation business to provide potential acquirers our partners and we spoke to a number of interested parties who expressed interest in all options ranging from an outright purchase of our data centers and co-lo business, a partnership and\/or a joint venture. This is an ongoing process that could result in any one of these outcomes, including the potential sale of a portion of or all of our data center business.","Also, as we have said, we could ultimately choose to retain these assets and related operations. As we outlined in November, we believe, in the macro trends of the data center location industry and the importance of the service in our hybrid IP solutions, but we do not believe we must own the colocation facilities to provide the full range of services our customer needs to manage variety of functions. We expect to fully engage interested parties within the next two weeks or so.","Continuing now to Slide 8, as we enter 2016, we thought it might be useful to share with you a broader view of how we think about our business and operational focus for 2016 and beyond. First, I think it is important that we declare for our sales while we are here, what we are trying to accomplish and what we are trying to accomplish as an organization. For us that purpose is to improve the lives of our customers by connecting them to the digital world whether it is providing connections or services on top of their connection, using the power of the digital world to improve our customers' lives and businesses is really what we are all about.","We expect to accomplish this purpose through a two-part mutually reinforcing mission. First, we provide our customers a gateway to the digital world by enabling fast, highly reliable broadband connections that are automated and easy-to-use. We also have significant opportunity to take a leadership position on this front and our principle focus going forward will be to provide our customers with very best network experience.","Second, we will complement our strong access position by deploying less capital-intensive investments, higher growth solutions to deliver our customers a full range of technology-focused services such as managed network and hosting, cloud IP services and video along with over-the-top applications and content and we believe this approach will allow us to deliver the full range of services. Our customers are also allowing us to prioritize capital to improve the network services offerings are at the heart of our customer relationships.","Continuing on Slide 9, looking at our purpose from a financial point of view, our focus is to create long-term shareholder value through both, revenue growth and strong cash flow generation. I want to emphasize this last point. The focus of our business is to drive long-term free cash flow generation that enables us continue to invest in our business and sustain our strong dividend and we will prioritize our investments and operational initiatives to support that outcome.","We believe we can accomplish our goals through focus on three key operational initiatives. First, we will maximize market penetration of our network and adjacent services to drive growth. To accomplish this, we plan to maximize penetration in areas where we have invested in and enabled broadband capabilities. We will also continue to focus our investments on enabling fast, reliable broadband connectivity and we will enable other technology-focused solution such as managed network, hosting cloud, IP services and video, using capital-efficient solutions and partnerships.","Our second key initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As part of this effort, we plan to simplify our products, our processes and our systems and we will continue our evolution to a single orchestration layer that automates the end-to-end customer experience, enable to access the complementary services for multiple providers. Now, this will take time, but we have a roadmap in place to significantly improve our customer experience over the next couple of years.","Finally, we deploy a discipline approach to our operating capital investments to deliver profitable growth, first, by investing more capital to enable high bandwidth network connectivity and pursuing capital line investment approaches for our complementary adjacent services. Allocating capital based on the best returns on investments, in opportunities. Key strategic objectives will be key; we also expect to gain revenue and operating expense efficiencies and improved cash from operations through more aggressive systems consolidation, automation and process improvement.","We have a clear strategic direction, and we believe by focusing on these operational areas, we will be able to build CenturyLink's strong foundation and deliver value for both, our customers and our shareholders. While we are focus on specific actions to drive sales revenue growth of our strategic product and service in 2016 and beyond, we expect to drive further penetration of our consumer business and GPON footprint of over 900,000 households almost 500,000 businesses and have 3 million households enabled for Prism TV service and we expect to continue to expand high bandwidth data services GPON and Prism, enabling further revenue upside opportunities.","We also believe, we can continue sales momentum from the second half of 2015 and drive increased sales productivity through better go-to-market alignment, leveraging products specialist and enabling additional sales and sales performance tools and we plan to focus on winning large deals through dedicated teams and system integration and value-added resellers.","We expanded our distribution partners were key to this hitting our goals and driving us revenue. One final item I am sure you saw a release this afternoon announcing our new President of Sales and Marketing and Chief Marketing Officer. We look forward to Dean Douglas and Bill Hurley, joining our team next week, and I am confident they will be key contributors to helping us achieve the actions I have just discussed.","Now, I would like to turn the call over to Stewart for discussion of our financial results and liquidity position, as well as the guidance. Stewart?","Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I will review the financial results for the fourth quarter, provide an overview of the first quarter and full year 2016 guidance, we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and conclude my remarks with a discussion of CenturyLink's liquidity position.","Regarding our guidance, we are pleased that our full year expectations for 2016 are in line or better than current average analyst estimates.","Now moving to Slide 11, I will review a few highlights from our fourth quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules.","As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved strong results for the fourth quarter and operating revenues were $4.48 billion on a consolidated basis, a nine-tenths of 1% increase from fourth quarter 2014 operating revenues. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in high-cost support revenues of approximately $60 million, due to the recognition of CAF Phase 2 support during the fourth quarter 2015, along with strength in high bandwidth data services and consumer-strategic revenues.","Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue was $4.03 billion for the fourth quarter, a decline of only 0.5% from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in strategic products, including high speed data services, high speed Internet and Prism TV.","In the fourth quarter, we added approximately 16,000 Prism TV customers, while high speed Internet customers declined about 22,000 during the quarter, partially as a result of tighter credit standards implemented in mid-year 2015.","We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.82 billion for the fourth quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 40.6%. Cash expenses for the fourth quarter declined to $72 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. On a sequential quarter basis, cash expenses declined to $115 million or 4.1% from the third quarter of 2015.","Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures, along with other income, was $591 million for the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.80. As we have discussed in priorities earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments as outlined in our press release and associated supplemental financial schedules.","Additionally, as Glenn mentioned earlier, we repurchased more than 10 million shares for an investment of nearly $280 million during the fourth quarter, which completed the $1 billion share repurchase program.","Moving to Slide 12, our business segment, in fourth-quarter the business segment generated $2.66 billion in operating revenues, which decrease $43 million or 1.6% from the same period a year ago.","Fourth quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased 1.4% to $1.6 billion from fourth-quarter 2014, driven by continued strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS and Ethernet, partially offset by the declines in low bandwidth data services and wholesale re-pricing.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6.2% from fourth quarter 2014, due primarily to continuing decline in access lines and lower long-distance revenues. Total business segment expenses decrease from the year ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related expenses and CPE costs. Our segment margin was 44.1%, which was an increase from 43.6% a year ago.","Now, turning to Slide 13, consumer generated $1.51 billion in total operating revenues, an increase of $19 million or 1.3% from fourth-quarter 2014. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 6.3% year-over-year to $773 million, driven by year-over-year growth in high-speed Internet and Prism TV revenues.","Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined only 3.4% from fourth-quarter 2014 as access line and long-distance revenue declines were partially offset by selected price increases. Operating expenses decreased $17 million or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago.","Now turning to Slide 14, for first quarter 2015, we expect operating revenues of $4.40 billion to $4.45 billion, core revenues of $3.95 billion to $4 billion and operating cash flow between $1.66 billion and $1.72 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to rise from $0.67 to $0.73.","Our anticipated sequential decrease in first quarter operating revenues compared to fourth quarter 2015 is primarily due to declines in legacy, hosting and low bandwidth data services more than offsetting the anticipated growth in revenues from high bandwidth data services.","We expect first quarter 2016 operating cash flow to be lower than fourth quarter 2015, primarily driven by the decline in revenues I just mentioned, along with higher costs, Those higher costs include approximately $35 million from one-time favorable expense items in the fourth quarter and in first quarter $25 million of higher payroll taxes and $20 million related to higher marketing cost.","For full-year 2016, we expect operating revenues of $17.55 billion to $17.8 billion and core revenues of $17.75 to $16 billion. Both are expected to be slightly lower compared to full-year 2015 expected legacy revenue declines more than offsetting anticipated increases in the level of strategic revenue growth.","Our operating cash flow for the full-year 2016 is expected to be $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion, lower than full-year 2015 primarily driven by the continued decline in legacy and low bandwidth data revenues.","The Company anticipates lower depreciation and amortization expense for full-year 2016 compared to full-year 2015 and adjusted diluted EPS for full year 2016 is projected to be $2.50 to $2.70.","The expected lower full-year operating cash flow for 2016, along with higher cash income taxes and anticipated 2016 capital expenditures of $3 billion are expected to lower free cash flow to $1.8 billion to $2 billion.","Now, turning to Slide 15, since we recently issued $235 million of debt to refinance upcoming maturities, we thought we would provide you with our plans for our maturities over the remainder of the year.","Our total debt maturities for 2016 are approximately $1.4 billion. As I mentioned, in January, we completed a $235 million debt issuance with 7% Qwest Corp 40-year notes that will be used to refinance an upcoming May 1st maturity. That primarily leaves us with a [ph] debt maturity of a little less than $1.2 billion on June 1st.","We expect to be opportunistic in the coming months in refinancing some or all of that debt as well at the CenturyLink parent level. It is important to note that with approximately $400 million drawn as of the end of 2015 on our $2 billion credit facility, we have the capacity to handle the June 1 maturity if needed.","Additionally, since we completed our $1 billion share repurchase program in early December, we can also use available free cash flow for a portion of the June 1 maturity if necessary.","As is indicated by our 2016 guidance, we expect $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow after the cash dividends, which results in our dividend payout ratio in the low-to-mid 60% range in 2016, which is very sustainable, so we are confident that our solid cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility to meet our business objectives and drive long-term shareholder value.","That concludes our prepared remarks for today, so at this time I will ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America.","David Barden","Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. I guess a couple of questions if I could. For, Stewart, just first, number one, as we can kind of look at the 2016 guide, obviously last year we had issue with kind of overestimating how the year was going to play out, so I was wondering if you could kind of talk a little about what the base case expectations that you have modeled out for the economy and sales force ramp and whether your incoming Head of Revenue Mr. Douglas has bought into the expectations and kind of your comfort level of achievement albeit number one.","Second would be on the cash tax outlook and kind of the update on bonus tax depreciation, what's embedded in that free cash flow guidance?","Then and last one, if I could, would just be on kind of the metered data opportunity. I think, we have been seeing a lot of the cable companies experimenting with data caps and metering higher-end usage. It seems like the SEC is not pushing back on this and it feels like it could be a big opportunity for telcos to, if nothing else, price underneath the cable umbrella and start to raise rates from high-end users. I was wondering if that is something that you guys are looking at as an opportunity and where it stands. Thanks.","Stewart Ewing","Yes. David, in terms of 2016 revenue guidance, I believe, we do feel more comfortable with the revenue guidance that we have this year from the guidance that we provided in '15. We think, we had some things in place from a sale standpoint, our funnel continues to build and look good. We have a number of big deals that are in the funnel and hopefully we can get closure with some of those.","We are also working on the provisioning, the order-to-cash to get the sales that the salespeople make, provision and billing quicker and hope to be able to get that done of course over the next few months to where we can reduce our cycle times there, that will help.","The other focus that we have is churn reduction, so we are working there to try to keep the customers we have and try to make some of the price declines in credits that we have been issuing smaller, so we are hopeful that we are attacking revenue not just from a sale standpoint this year, but also from the standpoint of reducing churn as well as getting the orders and to cash quicker.","We also have a big deal team that we have talked about before that was launched to pursue larger opportunities. In terms of the guidance and the macroeconomic issues, I mean, we have basically have assumed that the economy stays about like it is at this point, so no real significant changes there.","Glen, I will let you talk about Dean.","Glen Post","Yes. We had discussions with Dean and with Bill Hurley, and at high-level, they feel good about the over projecting sales. Obviously, they have not had the opportunity to getting the details, but I know we have had discussions with them and they believe we have upside in a lot of areas, but they have not had a chance to really to getting the details of our projections at this point.","Stewart Ewing","From the standpoint of, so just to kind of close out the revenue, we had some revenue growth this year in the fourth quarter. We did in first quarter of 2015. We would expect probably second quarter 2016, we would reach a little bit of revenue growth, but in terms we are going to be so close just in terms of projecting that we are going to get stability and growth on a sequential basis quarter-after-quarter.","It is really not possible for us to do that now, but we think that with the three-pronged approach that we have to really driving revenue, keeping the revenue we have, getting customers to billing quicker, it will pay dividends for us from the standpoint of getting some real momentum in terms of our revenue growth.","In terms of cash taxes, our cash taxes for 2015 were $63 million. Based on the operating income guidance that we provided for 2016, we would expect cash taxes to be approximately $400 million at the low-end of guidance and about $600 million at the high-end of guidance. As we say with the free cash flow that that results and after the operating income you result in the dividend payout ratio being in the low to mid 60s.","I might add that dividend payout ratio in 2017, at this point, we would say we would be coming in the low to mid 70s, because we think that cash taxes will increase somewhat in 2017 just because of the impact of bonus depreciation will be less as it matures more.","Then, David, regarding the metered data plans; we are considering that for second half of the year. We think it is important and our competition is using the metered plans today and we think that explore those starts and trials later this year is our expectation.","David Barden","Great. All right, thanks you guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. You know, building upon the prior question around sort of thinking about the trajectory of the business from a top-line perspective, how should we think about some of the opportunities that you have in terms of reducing the cost in the business?","Specifically, if you do find yourself in a position, where you can get sort of stable top-line growth, can we pull forward the expectation around the ability to return to EBITDA growth and operating income growth of the business?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. I mean, we still think that we can hopefully, after we get to some level of revenues' continued stability and growth, that we can get to EBITDA stability within 12 months to 18 months thereafter, but again as I have said many times before, the EBITDA stability is really dependent upon continued movement, continued improvement and sales of our strategic products over time and lessening the decline in the rate of legacy revenue that we receive and then also the third leg of that stool basically is to continue to control our operating expenses to get to EBITDA stability.","Glen Post","I might add t that the simplification of our processes, the automation of a lot of the end-to-end process is a single platform, orchestration platform I mentioned earlier, those are weighed with - we could take significant cost out of the business as well as create a much better customer experience, so those areas we are looking at for future cost control.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. Then if I may follow-up on the exploration of the strategic alternatives for the data centers side, it sounds as though based on your prepared comments moving forward are well on that front. Can you talk to us about the interest perhaps you may or may not have seen in the marketplace, there have been a number of folks who have either expressed a goal to do something similar or at least have been rumored to potentially be doing something similar, so I would like to hear sort of compare and contrast what you are hearing in the market in terms of receptivity would be very helpful.","Glen Post","Obviously, we are aware of this. There is an activity in the market with folks with data centers, colocation businesses out there possibly for sale, but I can tell you this, we are seeing a significant amount of interest right now. You do not know - get the negotiations, which we hope stock gets in a couple of weeks that process, but we are seeing interest from strategic buyers as well as potential buyers and asking a lot of questions running in the data room, want to start talking with us about the opportunities. Again, you never know, but the interest level is high right now.","Amir Rozwadowski","Thank you very much. It is very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks very much. The buyback program is over. I understand you are waiting for the results of the data center, but can you just talk more broadly about your leverage target and given the credit environment adhere, how are you thinking about where you want that leverage to be over time in terms of how much of a surface free cash and how much of a data center sales might go to maintaining a sort of a three-turns would you want to bring that down under three turns over time?","On broadband, can you just update us? You gave us some good stats on the speeds and the build-out there. How are you thinking about returning broadband to growth we are seeing pretty tough quarter so far for the telcos relative to K, while we touched on that in the earlier question, but you are obviously getting the speeds up there. What can you do on the channel side, marketing side to turn that back to growth and maybe you can just leave in gap- to progress into that. Thank you.","Stewart Ewing","Yes. Simon, so the leverage targets, I mean, we are still goal of about three times, but what we said is that know as the EBITDA declined somewhat, we were basically willing to go over three times if we saw that EBITDA over time was going to turn around and could bring us back to three times or lower, so you we will look at the proceeds from the sale of the data.","At this point, we do not have any goal to reduce our leverage below three times, so I mean, we still think that with what we have done with our debt maturities. We have plenty of liquidity and generate plenty of free cash flow and we will wait and see what happens with respect to the data center sale and then we will decide from there what we do more or less with the $600 million to $800 million of free cash flow that we expect to have in '16 after the payment of the dividend as well as the cash associated with the potential sales of the data center.","Glen Post","Regarding the broadband, first of all, we believe that we have real opportunity to take advantage of the investments we have made in recent months in GPON and Prism, we passed now about 950,000 homes with GPON, 1 gig speeds to 780,000 of those homes. That is 17% increase from the third quarter in terms of GPON homes passed.","We grew our Prism markets with GPON capabilities from 600,000 to 700,000 in fourth quarter and we are seeing really strong take rates, where we have GPON in these homes and businesses, so that is a really positive for us. We average about, right now, just in this early on, we just released that we got about 15% penetration in our GPON markets of the GPON products, so it has grown and that is just as you know we rolled out this past year.","We are real pleased with that and that opportunity also gives, also, if you look at our market share data. Our market share in a lot of these cities we are in is very low. We think we have upside there going in these businesses and we are also attach or connecting more of the MDUs and [ph] within our markets that we believe give us a lot of opportunity. We have had very little market share there.","More than 30% of our households that we serve are in MDUs, so that is a real market opportunity there as well that we are focused on, so there are some things we are doing, we believe, can really turn around the broadband growth.","Simon Flannery","Great. That is something remained positive adds for 2016, is it too early to say?","Stewart Ewing","I think we will. Even if it is little early, but I believe we are on a path of a positive adds in '16.","Simon Flannery","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. Two questions. First on the high speed data growth side, you saw some acceleration in the quarter. Can you provide us split for retail versus wholesale and do you expect that trend to continue in the first half of the year.","Then on CapEx, can you provide some color on where that $3 billion will go in terms of different buckets and how should we think about incremental fiber deployments and any trends you could highlight in terms of cost of deployment coming down and potentially accelerating that trend. Thank you.","Stewart Ewing","Batya, in terms of the CapEx color, basically in 2016 a little bit over $2 billion or so of the capital budget, albeit, what we called revenue in hand enablement and support. Probably of that approximately $2 billion, basically broadband enablement in connection and capacity is about $1.2 or so and then the Ethernet MPLS enablement is probably about $600 million or so.","You know, we are going to expect to continue to spend capital to range higher hire and invest in the access part of our business to basically be able to through either fiber or other technologies over time, be able to drive higher speeds for our customers.","Glen Post","Then, Batya, on the breakdown between wholesale and retail, we do not have that here, but we can follow-up Tony, if someone could follow with him - we just do not have it right here.","Batya Levi","Right. In terms of the trends going forward, would you still expect that to grow at high-single digits?","Stewart Ewing","Yes. As far as the - broadband growth, yes.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ana Goshko from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Ana Goshko","Thank you very much. I think you laid out pretty well what the plan is for addressing the 2016 bond maturity, particularly with the state of the credit markets right now, but wondering one is there an interest rate level at which you in your mind it becomes prohibited to refinance that on an unsecured basis and have you thought about moving into the secured market, where you would likely get a cost of capital.","Stewart Ewing","Ana, we have looked at that and we are continuing to look at it some, and I guess we have not made really any final decisions, but at this point I mean, we would prefer to stay unsecured. Even if it might cost us a little bit more.","Again, we can carry, we can really be opportunistic with this next with little less than $1.2 billion that we need to raise to refinance the Embarq maturity, because again we have about $1.6 availability on the credit facility.","Additionally, our highest free cash flow quarter of the year is the first quarter, because basically our CapEx somewhat gets off to a little bit of slow start. We just have more free cash flow in the first quarter. We probably generate over 50% of our free cash flow that we are going to generate in the first quarter really.","We had a lot of options and we will look at secured options, but at this point, we are not leaning in that direction.","Ana Goshko","Okay. Great.","Stewart Ewing","Not to say we would not go there over time, but\u2026","Ana Goshko","Okay. Thank you. Then also I think I heard this correctly, so any decision on further shareholder returns beyond the current dividend? Did you say that you are going to wait until you get through the data center process and potentially through this Embarq maturity as well before you decide what to do with access free cash flow in the year?","Glen Post","Yes. Certainly, through the Embarq maturity and in all likelihood until we get much more color in terms of what is going to happen with the data center business.","Ana Goshko","Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you very much for that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael Rollins","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. Just first a housekeeping item, can you talk about why depreciation may fall in 2016?","Then secondly, if you go back I think it was a few weeks ago, the Company filed a lengthy 8-K describing some changes to the Board and pointed to some maybe differences in perspective. Can you provide us with more contexts maybe to what happened and maybe some of the strategic issues that the Company may or may not be wrestling with in the boardroom? Thanks.","Glen Post","Yes. I will the first one, Mike, on depreciation. Basically, we would expect depreciation and amortization to be down somewhere between $200 million and $250 million 2016 versus 2015. About $75 million of that decline it is really a decline in the customer list amortization that we have that was really part of the purchase price adjustments related to primarily the Qwest acquisition and the Embarq acquisition as well.","The depreciation rate, the decline of the depreciation really is due to some of our assets becoming fully depreciated and retired, so basically that decline in depreciation that we have that did occurred in 2015 is offset to a certain degree by the $3 billion that we expect in depreciation in the $3 million we expect to invest in 2016 in our plan, so really about $100 million to $150 million decline really related to just the depreciation part.","Stewart Ewing","Mike, regarding Joe Zimmel's departure, of course Joe made a lot of contributions to our Company. 12 years he was here, we appreciated that and wish him very best. Understanding the 8-K that we filed really in connection with and review of the Board - the nominating and governance committee recommended and the Board also concluded that Joe should not stand pre-election at the 2016 meeting. The Board felt the changed would lead to an environment with improved productivity, constructive dialogue. It was really it just that Board chemistry issues with this was and no time Joe raised any issue about the Company's accounting, our financial reporting either leading up to following his resignation.","Also, Joe did not raise concerns about the Company's strategy or succession planning prior to his resignation. At least not that I am aware of - his principle complain related the process the Board used to reach the conclusion that he would not be included on the 2016 slate.","I think obviously he might comments to and there is a lot details in our 8-K we filed in January 25th and you can read all of that, but that really contains exactly what happened in my view and includes Joe comments as well.","Michael Rollins","If I could just follow-up with one another question, do you keep tallies internally of the proportion of your footprint, where you have a comparable or better speed for broadband that you can mark to your customers and definitely that you can share with us in terms of what that might look like? I realize you shared us earlier some stats on GPON and some of the builds there, but more broadly, do you have a sense of just how you fully stack up against the cable competitor?","Glen Post","Firstly, yes. We have that information and we used it continually. I do not have it here. It is skill test for us. Total overall percentages and speeds, but we have in marketing department sales, we use that continually, have to identify where we build additional capacity, how we go to market with advertising and all that, pricing all that comes into play, but that is a very broader part of our analysis.","Michael Rollins","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack","Hey, guys. Thanks. Glen, I just you still have another though I guess, on the economies. I think somebody asked earlier, but any feedback you are getting from your bigger business customers with respect to that is skittishness or nervousness on the part of making decision or slowing down decision-making. Then the second part, just on the involuntary churn in the high-speed adds, I am just trying to get a sense for what it is that is going on there and perhaps how long that might persist? Thanks.","Glen Post","First of all, Mike, on the customers' prospective economy anybody connected with - the income connected with the oil and gas business is skittish right now obviously for good reason, so we are seeing some of that in oil and gas sector.","Of course it is not a major vertical. We do have customers there, but it has been a major article for us. I found that we are not seeing a lot of concerns out there right now. We see what happens the next few months, but right now we were already seeing long decision-making timeframes, by businesses the last year or so, so that is not a change and we are still seeing that, but we are not getting major negative feedback from our customers at this point in time, also the oil and gas sector.","Mike McCormack","Okay.","Glen Post","Involuntary churn on - we hope we worked in most of that fourth quarter, so we think those changes we may last year on the credit requirements and the higher prices, the price increases that we last, we think we - most of that so, hopefully we will see the first quarter that can be in the first quarter.","Mike McCormack","Were those customers, Glen, folks that had chosen some other providers and just decided to stop paying you without disconnecting or was there something else we should be thinking about?","Glen Post","It was that and just folks who never play, they are just never playing. They come in and we just gives service for three, four months and both - they want to pay and it works, we put in differ requirements.","Michael Rollins","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank Louthan","Great. Thank you. Can you describe a little bit of the product and system simplifications that you are looking at and maybe how long that will take and ultimately the cost there. Then on the strategic review with the data center, what kind of economic benefits do you expect to see from some sort of a partnership arrangement. I asked that partly, because I have never actually seen one work, so I am curious what you think how that might work versus just now right sale? Thank you.","Glen Post","Hi, Frank. Aamir Hussain is here, our Chief Technology Officer. I will address the systems. It is a major undertaking for us. I can tell you this, we are already seeing benefits, but it will be a continual effort over next two years, two-and-a-half really. Amir, you want to\u2026","Aamir Hussain","Yes. Both product and system simplifications are only driven by a rationalization of the products and networks and the system and applications we have. The end goal is to reduce provisioning cycle and get revenue on the door as soon as possible and we have multiple streams. We are looking at products, we are looking at processes, and we are looking at systems.","Refined and used our portal platforms and consolidate multiple portals providing greater customers experience. At the end of the day, the whole lead to cash process is being looked at and every process within those processes are being combined to create a great experience for the customer.","Again, such us your systems, your processes getting revenue in the door and enhancements into our current systems and processes that new technologies to be able to provide better opportunities to our sales and operations folks to provide great customers experience.","Glen Post","Regarding the economic benefits on a joint venture of the data centers has been - what you mean by joint venture, there is a lot different approaches to a joint venture, but the main thing that we would like to be able to do is continue to have wholesale opportunity within the centers that we own today. We would like to avoid the high level of capital expenditures required.","We think we can drive higher returns by investing those dollars in network and other areas, so that is really our view of that. Not only that, the valuations are significant right now and we think it is a good time. We are going to consider this now for time to do it.","We think it is a good business. It is good, the margins are good, we are growing this business some, so it is not we are running from it, it is just we think the ownership of the assets, we do not think we have to own those assets, so that is really areas we are looking at all the alternatives.","Mike McCormack","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Seshadri from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Arun Seshadri","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I just want to make sure I heard you right. I think you said your preference was to refinance the Embarq notes at the parent level. I just want to understand the rationale for that and whether you thought about sort of doing it refinancing at the Embarq level of sales or potentially at sort of intermediate wholesale as well?","Glen Post","Yes. Basically, we have been trying to - since all the acquisitions over the years, to simplify our capital structure somewhat and frankly really we have looked at the potential or refinancing out at the Embarq level. It creates another public entity that we have to do the public filings on and all and we just think it is not worth the effort of all of that as well as the rate differentials it is not that significant.","We have, for the last five years or so, been working to refinance debt at Qwest Corp at Qwest Corp, the debt matures there, because it is still investment grade. Everything else is the parent's non-investment growth, so we have been moving everything up there and we think - I mean, we had grew really good rates and good execution over the year, so I mean as I mentioned earlier we will see over time if we need to go into more a secured product to get a better rates at this time we do not think we need to, but we will just monitor that over time.","Arun Seshadri","Okay. I appreciate that. As far as the cash taxes for 2017, I think you said that it would be higher than 2016, but you have sort of a preliminary number in which tune something in the 700-plus million range?","Glen Post","If you look at pre-tax at book income, possibly somewhere in the range of maybe 45% to 55% would be the effective cash tax, but it is early add and we will have to see. I mean, that I am sure will change some over the year as we get closer to '17, but it will go up some, so the benefit of bonus depreciation to us over the life of the program is a little bit over a $1 billion and we figure we got $250 million of the benefit in '15 an probably $450 million of the benefit in '16, so we have got and we will have by the end of '16 achieved about $700 million of the little bit over $1 billion deferral that we expect to get during the life of the bonus depreciations legislation and that assumes our CapEx stays at about the same level as it is today.","Arun Seshadri","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Saber from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go head.","David Saber","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones, in looking at the supplemental info, it looks like there was a sizable working capital outflow more than 500 million. Just curious if that was not anomaly and if we could expect that to perhaps reverse in future periods.","Then secondly, just back on the Embarq maturity for second, Stewart you mentioned perhaps using their revolver as a backstop, so I guess I just wanted to ask if that would be use only if the market were closed or would you perhaps look to use that even if there the rates environment is still not favorable to you?","Stewart Ewing","The decline in working capital was basically on October 1 maturity of debt that we paid off so that is why our working capital declined. In terms of the credit facility, we have said we are going to keep about $1 billion of capacity on the credit facility just for things like this.","Times we are in the markets or not where we want to issues, with the free cash flow that we will have in 2016 even beyond the dividend payment of $600 million to $800 million I mean we are opposed to keep it all the credit facility for some time. If we need to in order to get about a rate and to get past, let the high yield markets feel themselves somewhat.","David Saber","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. Just a quick housekeeping question, I was hoping you could give us an update on the net funding status of the pension at the end of the year and whether you anticipate making any cash contributions in 2016? Thanks.","Glen Post","Yes. Now, we will file our K. Yes, the 2016 was our target, so we will file our K in a couple of weeks and all the pitch and disclose the pages and pages of pitching it and hope that disclosure will be in there, so I really do not have that at this point in time.","Brett Feldman","Do you have a preliminary estimate to where you need to make a cash contribution or is that still being work out?","Glen Post","We do not need to make the cash contribution. We have made voluntary cash contributions of a $100 million in 2015, and I think we did the same thing in 2014. We have not made the decision. We do not need to make a decision on '16, until September before we file our tax returns, so but at this point nothing is actually required.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes our questions-and-answers session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remark.","Glen Post","Thank you, Saeed. We discussed with you last quarter that we believe that our investment in network and adjacent businesses along with our organizational changes and cost control efforts were beginning to take effect and produce results.","We believe we can now clear see that progress in our fourth quarter results and we plan to continue to leverage and positions our assets, help drive future revenue growth, EBITDA growth and shareholder value.","Although our results may not be perfectly on in here, in the months ahead I am confident that we are on a path to long-term growth and value creation, so thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with in the weeks ahead.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program. You may disconnect and have a wonderful day."],"4977":["CenturyLink, Inc.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, November 8, 2017.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Tony Davis - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, France, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink and Level 3 Communications third quarter 2017 results released earlier this afternoon.","The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for full year 2017 for standalone CenturyLink and Level 3 and other outlooks in our combined business.","The Level 3 prior period results are presented on a pro forma basis adjusted to reflect changes made to customer assignments between the wholesale and enterprise channels at the beginning of 2017 due to mergers between certain customers and other changes.","Unless otherwise noted, Level 3 revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year basis and a constant currency basis. Finally, certain Level 3 metrics discussed in the call today exclude acquisition-related expenses associated with the CenturyLink transaction. Those metrics are adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, free cash flow and net leverage, and we've footnoted the details in our press release and earnings presentation.","We also ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.","Now moving to slide 3. We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at ir.centurylink.com.","And now turning to slide 4, your host for today's call is Glen Post, CenturyLink's Chief Executive Officer. Joining Glen on today's call are Jeff Storey, CenturyLink's President and Chief Operating Officer; CenturyLink's Executive Vice President, Stewart Ewing; and Sunit Patel, CenturyLink's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through November 15, 2017, and the webcast replay of our call will be available through February 6, 2018. Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of November 8, 2017, and should be considered valid only as of this date regardless of the date heard or viewed.","And now as we move to slide 5, I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you for joining our call today. As many of you are aware, Stewart Ewing is retiring from CenturyLink after 34 years of service for the company, 28 of which he spent serving as Chief Financial Officer. Today will be his final time participating in our earnings call and I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to acknowledge and thanks Stewart for his years of service and his dedication to our company. Over the years, Stewart has not only been a colleague to me and others, but he's been a trusted and valued friend and we will miss him greatly. His passion for the company, his astute financial leadership over the years have been invaluable to our company. Stewart, thank you for your many, many contributions to our company. I know everyone joins me in wishing you the very best in the future as well. I'm also pleased to welcome Jeff Storey and Sunit Patel to our call today and look forward to working closely with them in the months ahead.","So moving to slide 6. As you know, last week, we completed the acquisition of Level 3. It has been a year in the making and we are very excited about the opportunities before us. We really are building a new CenturyLink and bringing our companies together is a compelling, strategic combination for a number of reasons. First, we're even better able to serve our customers, win market share, and drive profitable growth with our complementary networks and product portfolios. Also, we're able to offer customers a broader range of services and solutions to meet their needs and help them in their digital transformation journey. Third, we're placing the customer first in all that we do. We have the opportunity to deliver a great customer experience, which can be a differentiator over time. And finally, I believe this combination will provide great opportunities for our employees in the months and years ahead.","Continuing on to slide 7. We believe this combination creates one of the world's most powerful networks. Together, we have a compelling set of assets, the scale to compete globally and the opportunity to drive significant operational efficiencies. With more On-Net capacity than ever before, a strong sales force and leading products, we are more confident than ever in our ability to gain market share in the months ahead.","We look at the stats \u2013 let's look at the stats. Today, CenturyLink has approximately 450,000 route miles of fiber globally. We have over 100,000 fiber-enabled On-Net buildings globally. We serve customers in more than 60 countries and we serve nearly 5.8 million homes with broadband and passed more than 1.6 million addressable units with fiber-to-the-prem. We believe we are uniquely positioned relative to others in the industry, both larger and smaller companies.","We're also better positioned to improve operational efficiency and drive profitable growth through expanded on-net capabilities, automation, and simplification. The increased scale of our business further strengthens our ability to take advantage of changing technological and competitive landscapes. And we've said before, our success in the future depends greatly on excellent execution, and we believe we are well positioned to accomplish this in the months ahead.","The operating expense and capital synergies along with the cash tax savings from the accelerated recognition of the net operating loss carry-forwards enhance our adjusted free cash flow generation and lower our dividend payout ratio. We realize the dividend is an attractive part of our shareholder return, and we are confident we can continue to pay the dividend while investing in growth and in our network and as we de-lever our balance sheet.","Turning now to slide 8. Since the acquisition last week, integration is well underway and on track with our expectations. We expect to have our sales team fully integrated in the first quarter of 2018. Also work is underway to complete our migration to a single ERP system, which is expected to occur in the second quarter 2018. Additional system and process changes will be ongoing, and we anticipate the majority of integration activities to be completed within approximately three years.","We remain confident in our ability to achieve nearly $1 billion in forward run rate operating capital cash synergies which, along with our focus on driving profitable revenue growth, should result in meaningful adjusted EBITDA growth over time.","Before Stewart reviews CenturyLink's standalone third quarter 2017 results, I want to provide a few high-level remarks about the quarter. CenturyLink's results for the quarter were below our expectations due primarily to lower-than-anticipated growth in Enterprise revenues.","For the third quarter, we came in at approximately $65 million below our internal expectations for Enterprise revenue primarily due to a miss of about $35 million in customer prem equipment revenue which, as you know, is typically low margin revenue with minimal impact to EBITDA.","We also generated about $20 million less growth in high-bandwidth data services than anticipated, approximately two-thirds of which was driven by contract renewals, pricing pressure with the remainder due to lower sales and installs than anticipated. And we had about $10 million of lower legacy revenues, primarily lower LD and private line.","However, we still delivered solid performance in high-bandwidth services revenue during the quarter with year-over-year growth of 3%, and really over 5% growth on a normalized basis. Also, our MPLS revenue increased nearly 5% over the year-ago period, which was above the market growth rate.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Stewart to discuss the results for the third quarter in more detail. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review CenturyLink's third quarter results. Please note that I'll be reviewing some of these results, excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial statements.","Turning to slide 10. As a reminder, the sale of our data centers and colocation business on May 1 resulted in approximately $150 million of decline in total and core revenues compared to the year-ago period. Third quarter operating revenue on a consolidated basis was approximately $4 billion, a decline of 4.7% adjusting for the Colo Sale.","Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $3.6 billion for the third quarter, a decline of 4.5% adjusted for the Colo Sale. Our operating expenses for the third quarter decreased to over $240 million year-over-year primarily due to a decline in depreciation expense and other expense reductions related to the sold colocation business along with lower salaries and wages expense related to the head count reduction in fourth quarter 2016, a $125 million of the $240 million decline in expenses is related to the sale of the colocation business.","Our operating income was $487 million for third quarter 2017. We generated adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion for the third quarter and achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.6%. Adjusted free cash flow defined as adjusted EBITDA less cash paid for taxes, interest, and capital expenditures, along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost and the ongoing impact of the accounting treatment related to the Colo Sale, stock-based compensation and other income, was $109 million for the quarter.","As a reminder, this included the impact of $100 million pension contribution that we made during the third quarter. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $0.17, a decrease from $0.28 in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.42.","Now moving to slide 11 and CenturyLink's Enterprise segment. In the third quarter, the Enterprise segment generated $2.17 billion in operating revenues, a decrease of 5.4% from the year-ago period, excluding the impact of the Colocation Sale. Third quarter Enterprise strategic revenues were $949 million, excluding the revenue of \u2013 impact of the Colocation Sale and the second quarter wholesale contracted price reduction, Enterprise strategic revenues grew more than 4% compared to third quarter a year ago.","Our legacy revenues for the segment declined 9.4% from third quarter 2016 due primarily to the continuing decline in voice and low-bandwidth data services. Total Enterprise segment expenses declined $133 million or 9.3% from second quarter 2016 primarily due to the reduction of approximately $90 million in expenses related to the sold colocation business in addition to other operating expense reductions.","Now turning to slide 12 and our Consumer segment. This segment generated approximately $1.39 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of 5.8% from third quarter 2016. Consumer strategic revenues declined 1.9% year-over-year to $774 million due primarily to the restructuring of a satellite video contract in the first quarter of 2017 and the impact of lower broadband units. Legacy revenues for the Consumer segment declined 10.2% from third quarter a year ago primarily due to access line declines.","Our operating expenses declined $22 million or 3.4% from the year-ago period due to lower employee-related expenses. Lastly, I'd like to review CenturyLink's standalone outlook for full year 2017. As was indicated during the second quarter earnings call, we anticipate coming in below our full year revenue and adjusted diluted EPS guidance provided in February of this year adjusted for the Colocation Sale.","Additionally, we now expect full year adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $100 million below the range primarily due to lower than anticipated strategic revenue growth and lower data integration margins in the last half of the year. We expect free cash flow to be approximately $250 million below the range due to the lower EBITDA and higher capital expenditures of approximately $150 million, which we expect to drive future margin.","Now I'll turn the call over to Jeff to provide an overview of the Level 3 results.","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Stewart. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll start off by saying that I'm thrilled to be talking to you today as the Chief Operating Officer of CenturyLink. I'm very excited about what we can do together now that we are one company. With the close of the acquisition last week, we've begun executing on our integration plans. And even with only seven days since the close, we've achieved several milestones. For example, we've interconnected the CenturyLink and Level 3 networks and are now beginning efforts to integrate them as a single unified network.","We've enabled our sales teams to quote the combined company footprint as on-net and have given them full access to the customer information for the accounts they support. We've defined the management organization, we've set out budget targets for 2018, and we have the business units developing their own detailed budgets and strategic plans for 2018. We have an aggressive but achievable integration plan for the year or two ahead and I have high confidence in our ability to hit the synergy targets we've discussed previously.","I view this as a three-step process. Interconnection is the first step and ensures we can easily and efficiently pass and trade traffic between all of our networks. Integration, the second step, is about being able to go to market as a single company and in a seamless way. There's a lot of work to do, but we have an excellent integration plan in place.","And lastly, transformation. It's not enough to incrementally improve on what CenturyLink and Level 3 were doing, we must transform the business to make it easier for our employees to do their jobs, to meet the evolving needs of our customers and to drive profitable growth.","As most of you know, the objective, I think, is the most important for driving shareholder value is increasing free cash flow per share. Over the coming year, you will hear me talk more about our own transformation effort and our initiatives to support our customers and their own digital transformation. All of these efforts are aimed at delivering profitable revenue and growth in free cash flow per share.","I thought I'd take a minute to talk about what the new CenturyLink is and what it is not. Our goal is to become the world's best enterprise networking company, recognizing that our wholesale and consumer customers are essential to provide us the scale and scope and capabilities we need.","But today, we routinely compete and win against the largest telecom providers in the world for the business from the most demanding enterprises. Sometimes, we are compared to a much smaller ROX (17:23). While we have rural service territories and I think we do a great job for those customers, we are also the local phone companies in cities like Denver, Phoenix, Seattle, Minneapolis, and many other large urban markets.","We have a great Consumer business that's very important to us, but we are not a primarily consumer-focused company. Approximately 25% of our revenue comes from consumers. 75% of our revenue comes directly from enterprises or through the wholesale customers we support.","Some may think of us as a North America-only company. And while we have an incredible network in North America, we are a global facilities-based provider with substantial networks in EMEA, Latin America and subsea, and we serve customers in more than 60 countries.","The reality is that the new CenturyLink is a leading telecommunications company in the global marketplace with excellent competitive capabilities. We have organized our team around our customers and are focused on profitable revenue, operational excellence to reduce cost and drive a great customer experience, and increasing free cash flow per share.","Sunit will provide more insight on this in a moment, but I want to get my perspective on the CenturyLink dividend. I've had the chance to speak with the board of directors, Glen and Sunit about it and we all agree, we are firmly committed to the dividend. As I look at our financial plans over the next few years, I'm confident about our ability to meet the dividend obligation and believe it is an important component of our equity story.","Turning to Level 3's third quarter 2017 results. We saw revenue growth in almost every area we measure: total revenue, core network service revenue, or CNS, and enterprise CNS revenue. With our disciplined approach to managing the business, we also saw continued margin expansion and growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow generation.","Even though we've seen a dampening effect due to the length of time it has taken to complete this transaction, our products and services resonate with our customers. Since a low-point in the fourth quarter of last year, we're seeing sequential improvement in enterprise CNS sales in each and every quarter and as our service delivery team installs the pending orders, we expect better sequential revenue performance in the fourth quarter. As we integrate this new company, we are focused on delivering value to our customers, improving the customer experience, competing aggressively to gain market share and managing our business with financial discipline. Having spent the last year with Glen and the management teams from CenturyLink and Level 3, I can tell you, we are all excited about the transformation efforts underway. We are confident in our ability to deliver the synergies we've announced. We have aligned our focus around driving free cash flow per share growth and support the dividend.","And I intend to push hard to increase our intensity, agility and speed in managing the business. In summary, we are well positioned as one of the largest enterprise communications providers in the world. The scope and scale sets us apart from where CenturyLink or Level 3 have been before. Together, we are a global enterprise-focused company and a strong competitor against the largest communications companies in the world.","With that, I'll turn it over to Sunit to provide an overview of the Level 3 detailed financial results. Sunit?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll start with a few financial highlights from Level 3's third quarter, which can be found on slide 14. We grew adjusted EBITDA to $752 million in the quarter with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 36.5%. Our free cash flow was $379 million, and we reaffirmed our full year 2017 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.","Let's now turn to revenue results on slide 15. For the third quarter, total revenue grew 1.1%, CNS revenue grew 1. 5%, and enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U. K. Government, grew 3.3%. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 2.8% compared to a 6.0% decline last quarter. Shifting to our regional results for the third quarter. North America CNS revenue grew 1.5%, and enterprise CNS revenue grew 2.8%. In EMEA, CNS revenue grew 0.5%, and enterprise CNS revenue, excluding U.K. Government, grew 5.7%.","In Latin America, CNS revenue grew 2.9% and enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.7%. Excluding the $4 million benefit from the Olympics we saw in the third quarter last year, enterprise CNS revenue grew 8.1%. From an individual product perspective, we saw CDN growth of 15%, dark fiber grew 7.9%, and managed security grew 7.6%. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, sequential enterprise sales performance has improved each quarter and our sales funnel remains healthy. Overall, from a revenue perspective, we remain focused on improving the performance of our Enterprise business across all of our regions. As Tony noted at the start of the call, the following metrics exclude CenturyLink acquisition-related expenses.","Turning now to slide 16. Adjusted EBITDA was $752 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, which includes the typical increases in seasonal utility cost we mentioned last quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5% in the third quarter of 2017. This compares to 35.2% in the third quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures for the third quarter of 2017 were $318 million. Year-to-date, capital expenditures was 16% of total revenue. For the full year, our outlook remains unchanged at 16% of total revenue.","Company generated free cash flow of $379 million in the third quarter, which compares to $281 million from the year-ago quarter. In the third quarter of 2017, Level 3 generated net income of $157 million and basic earnings per share of $0.43.","I'll now cover Level 3's business outlook for 2017. As I highlighted earlier, we are reaffirming our 2017 financial outlook for full year adjusted EBITDA of $2.94 billion to $3 billion, and free cash flow of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion. I wanted to take a moment and discuss our thoughts on both the fourth quarter and future reporting for the new CenturyLink.","Our consolidated fourth quarter results will include two months of Level 3 results and three month of CenturyLink's results that will include the effects of purchase price accounting for Level 3 and the elimination of intercompany revenue and expenses between Level 3 and CenturyLink. We'll supplement this reporting with summary results of Level 3 and CenturyLink for the fourth quarter.","We will also provide pro forma fourth quarter results for the combined business, assuming the merger was completed at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Those results will include the effects of purchase price accounting and the elimination of intercompany revenue and expenses.","Acquisition-related expenses will be separately identified since this cost will be significant in the fourth quarter given the closing of the transaction on November 1. Regarding guidance. Going forward, we plan to provide only annual guidance. Effective with fourth quarter 2017 reporting, we will no longer provide quarter forward guidance. In general, we'll focus on bottom line performance metrics such as adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.","As a reminder, our target leverage range is 3 times to 4 times. But for the combined company, our trailing 12-month net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the third quarter was 4.2 times on a pro forma basis, excluding acquisition-related expenses. We are confident we'll be able to drive down our leverage ratio every year.","I'd now like to take a moment and touch on the dividend. We are very confident and committed to maintaining the current dividend. Our confidence comes from our view of the business and our ability to expand margins and drive sustained growth in both adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow over the next few years. In summary, we are focused on achieving a successful integration and achieving the synergies we have outlined.","With that, I'll turn the call over to our operator for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Sunit. Our first question will be from the line of Philip Cusick from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, Sir.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. Two, if I can. First, particularly for Jeff and Sunit, I appreciate the commentary already but I wanted to follow up on the company's dividend. Do you think you can confidently de-lever the business and invest in the company to the necessary level while still paying out all that cash? And what would have to happen for you to change that view? And then for Glen, can you dig more into the consumer broadband business? Where are we on rolling out the new plans and speeds? And how should we look at that going forward? Thank you.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll take the first part of the question. So, Phil, yeah, I think we had plenty of time over the last year to study the trends in the business, our plans for integration, synergy realization. And as Jeff mentioned, we've already finalized the budgets and targets for next year. And as we look at that and what we think we can execute, we are very comfortable and confident with the comments that I made, that you've heard Glen make, and Jeff make around the dividend. And so, to your point about what would happen that would not make us comfortable, there's nothing we see today that doesn't give us the confidence. So I think we've tried to be realistic about our assessments and our remarks reflect that.","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And one quick add-on to that. Phil, this is Jeff. It also includes us continuing to invest in growing our business. We don't think that we have to massively cut capital expenditures or do anything unnatural. We think we can grow this business. We think we can capture the synergies. We think we can continue to invest in it and support the dividend.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. And to be clear, I think we are looking at spending capital at about the same level as a percent of revenue as we have been. So we don't see any scenario where we have to hold back on investment. That's consistent with what we have been doing.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I also think that we can get better returns on the investment, given the scale and the combined reach of the network that we have. We are closer to more customers as a combined company, from a physical reach perspective, than we are as standalone companies.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Sunit. And, Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. First of all, on the consumer broadband piece, we are focused \u2013 as we've talked about, we're focused on attracting higher lifetime value customers with higher average revenue per customer, or ARPU, through our Price For Life offers. We've been very successful with that, and although we lost around 100,000 units, our revenues were flat. And with that, we also reduced our cost because we haven't \u2013 we have higher margins with those higher revenue customers. So we end up with better cash flows with that. We also had a one-month delay in the launch of Price For Life in the, what we call our legacy Qwest markets, and we've just launched now and doing well, we had a one-month impact there.","And the other thing we saw was just a much higher than expected loss of customers at the 20 megabits and below speeds in a lot of the markets where we have that. So we had a much higher loss there. I think a couple of reasons, first of all, you see cable rolling out more with more aggressive offers, higher speeds and just the demand for bandwidth in those markets. We \u2013 as far as what we're doing going forward, we're going to continue to lead with Price For Life offers. We're going to focus on the higher-value customers. We think it's the right approach. We're also going to focus on penetrating the higher-speed footprint we've enabled already.","We'll continue to invest in the higher speeds we've talked about previously and we'll provide a higher-value offer in the coming months in the fourth quarter for customers in the lower speed markets. We'll try to take some \u2013 we're not going to \u2013 go with the promotions we've had in the past. We don't think that's the right approach. But we'll try to have a value offer for them where we have the lower speeds.","As far as the plans for our continued build out of the markets as we've talked about before, our view is that we should always enable the high-speed, the technology and market economics allow us to. We'll put fiber in where it makes sense. But if you look at our \u2013 what we've talked with you about before, in our top 25 markets by early 2020, we expect to have over 90% of homes passed with 40 megabits or more of service, over 70% of our homes, and businesses passed with 100 megabits and service or more in over 20%, with a gig of service or more. And we'll keep working to enhance those speeds. We think the more we can get of share, especially with fiber, we'll do more of that when we can. But we believe it's the right approach. And I may have not mentioned this, but we saw growth in all speed bands other than 20 megabits and below. We saw growth in units in all of the other speed bands above that. So it is speed that's making a big difference and we'll continue to focus on that build-out.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Glen.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe one question on the CenturyLink side and one on Level 3. Revenues have been coming in much lower than expected since the beginning of the year. Can you point to the main drivers of the revenue miss? And how quickly do you think the transformation of the businesses will drive improvement in revenue trends? In typical deals before, we've seen interruption to the sales as you integrate the assets. How do you manage that shift?","And one on Level 3 side. I guess there has been some expectation for North America Enterprise CNS trends to improve on a sequential basis, it was flat for the second quarter in a row. What's driving that? Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll take the first question and let Stewart maybe offer his comments as well. We had an aggressive plan for strategic revenue coming in end of the year and as above market plan. And although our strategic revenue has grown, specifically our high-bandwidth revenues grown in the 5% range on a normalized basis, we had anticipated higher growth than that.","And we thought we could \u2013 because of market share opportunities and products we have, we could beat the market to a greater degree than we did. That's the biggest area that what we've missed. We've had some other issues with some legacy revenues that didn't meet our expectations in long distance and private line losses were greater than expected. But primary issue is we had a very aggressive view of the strategic revenues, high-bandwidth revenues on the Enterprise side and that's been the issue we're primarily dealing with. Stewart, do you want to...?","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. No, that's really it, Batya. And I might point out, too, that we \u2013 our actual revenues for the third quarter from a core revenue standpoint, we're only about $10 million \u2013 although they were lower than our estimates, we're only about $10 million lower than the average analyst estimate. And total operating revenue was about $30 million below the average analyst estimate. So a big part of the miss there is related again to the CPE revenue, which is very low margin revenue.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. Batya, I'll say that, since March, the CPE revenue has been a big hit on us as well. Just look at the $35 million in the fourth quarter, that's been a big factor in the revenue miss this year.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll cover the question on North America Enterprise and Jeff can talk about transformation. So on that one, I think as we've been saying now, we've seen our sales been picking up every quarter and Jeff noted in his remarks, but we are quite confident you will see the North America Enterprise revenue performance strengthening sequentially in the fourth quarter driven both by us turning up new service and our churn improving. That combined you will see the strength show up in the fourth quarter and we are pretty confident of that.","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And you asked about integration and misses in sales did result from a lot of integrations. Integration is tough and we need to make sure that we are very, very focused on maintaining the relationship between our sales team and our customers. We've done a lot of integrations between the two companies. We both have a lot of experience in it. Our teams have a lot of experience in it. So we're bringing that to the table.","But some of the specific things we're doing are making sure that we don't move a bunch of accounts unnecessarily, making sure that we move accounts one-time, making sure that we try and maintain that relationship between the customer and their account rep, making sure we give information to the account rep to be successful in selling. And then that all the back-office support from service delivery to service assurance that we maintain the experience for the customer so that we can drive continued performance.","Integration is important. But I also talked about transformation. And transformation is something that we have an opportunity in front of the combined company. We want to change the way our customers interact with CenturyLink. We want to make it simpler for our employees to meet their needs. We continue to deliver an enhanced customer experience for the customers. If we focus our efforts on driving an extraordinary customer experience, then I worry far less about sales misses or the integration impacts of those things. But we are very, very focused on making sure we maintain the momentum, keep up the effort to deliver great customer experience and drive sales and revenue going forward.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And, Batya \u2013 and, Jeff, maybe think of one other item with our sales team, and I've been talking, obviously, with the sales team the last few months to see what's going on out there. And one of the things that they refer to is just the uncertainty that's been caused by the elongated process of bringing these two companies together. And I realize it's somewhat of an excuse, but it's real to these folks and they're uncertain of where they're going to be.","We changed out the \u2013 especially in the global enterprise space, we changed out the leadership to the Level 3 leadership and it caused a lot of unrest within the CenturyLink ranks. And I've tried to put that to rest, we've all worked on it, but it's been a real factor out there. And I believe that after the first year we get these teams on the same \u2013 get teams assigned, to get everyone on the same page, we're going to see better performance of our sales teams.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Maybe just one quick follow-up. How quickly do you think that we will start to see the transformation efforts flow into improving revenue trends? So a year from now, for example, do you expect the revenue decline to improve from the current level?","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I expect \u2013 so, it's hard to say. You're asking me to predict the future and I'll give a warning upfront. I'm no good at predicting the future and now I'm going to go ahead and try. I think that a year from now, we ought to seeing success in the target customers that we're going after with the target products and services that we're going after them with. We think that we have a great capability today to deliver for Enterprise customers, and we want to continue to do that. And so, we think we have a great capability today. After we continue to work on integration and transformation, we ought to have a great capability a year from now and we ought to be seeing some results in it. Now again, I'm hesitant to predict exactly when some change is going to occur, but those are the things we are focused on.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions. A couple, if I may. In thinking about the synergy opportunities, I realize it's early in terms of the close of the transaction. But now that you've had a chance to examine the business a bit, how do we think about potential outperformance relative to the synergy expectations? It seems as though there could be some opportunities to refine those expectations on a going-forward basis and would love to hear if there is sort of a change or thought process around that?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll take that. So I think on the synergies, yes, we've had a fair bit of time over the last year. I think the good news there is, as we indicated, we got our target set for next year. We're all executing on those. So I would say that sitting here a year later from when we made the announcement, our confidence in being able to meet those synergies is very high. There is more \u2013 less risk involved now since we have \u2013 we're executing on specific plans to hit that.","Our plan is that, every quarter, we will report on achievement of run rate synergies and, obviously, we'll report on integration cost to keep investors and analysts apprise of how we are doing on that. But I think the summary is our confidence level has increased a lot. We see a lot less risk in achieving the synergies we had outlined a year ago.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. And a follow-up, if I may. On the \u2013 specifically on the surprise CapEx on the CenturyLink side. Can you provide us some color in terms of sort of what was the higher-than-expected CapEx? Was it driven by particular investments to target specific opportunities? And how should we think about that run rate going forward?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Stewart, yeah.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","So the higher CapEx was driven by, one, on the MPLS and the Ethernet customers in terms of building two additional buildings. We decided to try to go ahead and accelerate that process a little bit to give us more inventory to sell into. Also, from a broadband standpoint for the Consumer business, we accelerated some CapEx there.","Additionally, we accelerated enough CapEx to bring our commitment under the CAF-II program up to where, by the end of this year, we'll be about 40% complete with that in terms of the households that we'll pass. So that was \u2013 those are the biggest items that really contributed to the higher CapEx, which should translate either in the higher revenue in the future or better margins in the future from an expense reduction standpoint.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll just add to that, that about $100 million of that overage is success-based capital. We actually sold more Ethernet and MPLS than we expected and, of course, we required construction there. So that's primarily where a big portion of that is anyway.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of follow-up questions. I guess, first, on the CenturyLink Consumer broadband side of the equation. Glen, I heard your comments earlier. Wonder if you could share with us what percentage of the pace is on these lower speed tiers, the sub-20 megabits, where you experience the churn? And sort of inline with that, any comments you can give in terms of how the quarter progressed as you rolled out Price For Life in the legacy Qwest side?","And then just a quick follow-up on the dividend discussion and now we've talked about it a lot already in the call. In light of the comments you guys have made, just wondering, I think when you announced the deal, the expectation was that three or four years out, you'd be at 60% payout ratio. It looks like, Glen, that CenturyLink is obviously been running a bit below expectations on the free cash flow side. How do you think about where that payout ratio looks now four years out?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll cover that first. So I think that as we look at everything that's happening I think, and as we've evaluated the business, I won't provide specific guidance on coverage ratios, just there's a lot of happening with tax legislation and as we work on our NOL utilization. But in general, I think the reason for the confidence is that I think we'll comfortably cover the dividend obligations. So our cash flow \u2013 free cash flow should continue to exceed the dividend obligation given both what we expect to do in the short-term from a synergies perspective and then, over the medium-term, utilizing our NOL and also improving the revenue trajectory over time. So I think as we look at all those things together, we just feel comfortable that that won't be a concern or an issue that we'll have. And obviously, anything with respect to the tax legislation would be a positive for the company.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Sunit, if I could just follow-up on that, it sounds like you've done a little bit more work around the NOLs, has the view in terms of how much you can save in taxes per year for that first four years or so changed or is that still work in progress?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","No, I think the work we've done just underlines the confidence we have in what we discussed about the benefits from the NOL a year ago. So I think we continue to be very confident that that we'll be able to utilize the Level 3 net operating losses to apply against our income, the U.S. Federal income.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Great. On the consumer broadband?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","On broadband, we \u2013 I don't have that right here is for the total we have on that. I know we've got the \u2013 trying to look at the objective here, with our top 25 markets where we're headed here is that we will have 90% with over 40 megabits in our top 25 markets. We only have 10% with less than 40 megabits by the end of 2019 or 2000 (sic) [2020] (45:02). I don't have the total here with we can give that with \u2013 Kristie will let you know what that amount is. Scott, I don't have it right here with me.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then just any comments around how trends progress throughout the quarter, particularly with the Price For Life growing through the legacy Qwest side that we see churns start to come down or gross adds pickup throughout the quarter?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, we have Price For Life churns come down significantly, absolutely, and we've got the \u2013 we're seeing good penetration, good take rates especially where we got the higher speeds with Price For Life. It's really been successful. Because we like the simplicity of the offer, the bill, the no fees. The only thing we don't \u2013 that's not covered in the Price For Life quoted price is the taxes.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Operator","The next question will be from the line of Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. I was hoping we can spend a little time talking about your MPLS business. I think you mentioned during the prepared remarks that MPLS revenues grew about 5% in the quarter. And I was curious, how does that compare to the run rate of growth in that product, say, over the last year or two?","The reason I ask is that there's clearly some emerging concern among investors that that product category is facing some products substitution headwinds. And I just don't think any of us have really good context for how to frame that. And if that is the case, could you maybe just talk to us a little bit about what the competitive dynamic is around the MPLS product set and do you have the ability to maybe offer some of the alternatives others are looking for?","And then I guess just the last question would be, I don't think any of us really know what portion of your revenues are from MPLS, if that's something you can share with us, I think it will be helpful? Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We don't talk about the percentage of revenue of MPLS, but over the last month, this is not exactly \u2013 I think it's been in the 5% to 7% range for MPLS growth. And I think what's really important here is that there's a lot of concern about SD-WAN coming in with \u2013 providers with, coming in \u2013 smaller providers perhaps coming in and taking market share away from us or MPLS customers away. And we have actually still growing. Even with all the activity in the marketplace, we're growing above market with MPLS. And that's really the point here. We have not seen \u2013 we have not suffered to this point from these companies coming in and competitors coming in and taking these customers away from us.","We believe that we'll see continued competition in this area but we have a great SD-WAN product. And most customers, when they buy this product they don't want just a pure SD-WAN, they're going to MPLS combined with the SD-WAN product. And most of the customers who are using the SD-WAN as the governance tool, the management tool, to manage all the transport to their branch offices.","So we have a very good tool. We sell a hybrid product that's been very successful, and we believe we are in a very good position to compete going forward for those customers. Jeff, do you want to add anything?","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, first of all, Brett, I think that Glen's comments on the quality of the product that we have are exactly right. We have a very good product here. And there are times \u2013 there's a lot of concern I'm hearing in questions, there's concern around will SD-WAN be a substitute for MPLS and, therefore, a headwind that we have to overcome? There will be cases where we sold an MPLS circuit, where an SD-WAN would've been a better solution. Those will transition. We're good at managing those transitions. There are also places where we lost and we're not able to sell an MPLS circuit because MPLS was too expensive and SD-WAN would've been a better solution. So there will be revenue opportunities for us to win in locations where we can't win today with just pure MPLS services.","And one of the things that we know absolutely is that our customers have a diverse set of networking needs, that there are data centers that they want to connect with dark fiber, that there are main locations that they want to connect with waves, that there are big branch offices that they want to connect with MPLS. And there are small locations that they want to connect with SD-WAN and the strength of the CenturyLink offering is that we can go across all of those dimensions and solve those networking needs for the customer across each one of those product sets.","And so, so are there headwinds that could come from SD-WAN and other technologies that are being developed? Of course, there are. But we're exceptionally good as an industry in dealing with those technology transitions and transformations. And we will be, as a company, very successful in dealing with those things and making sure that we continue to focus on satisfying our customers' needs for networking services with profitable revenue and making sure that we're investing in the infrastructure and it will be another tool that we can go to the market with.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That's helpful. If I can ask one quick follow-up then. If you're comfortable with the performance of that particular product, Glen, I do believe you mentioned that the strategic services revenues have been coming in a bit lighter than you had anticipated. What is the area of shortfall?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","It's just that we had higher expectations for Ethernet, primarily is where we had the biggest \u2013 we just had a very aggressive objective out there, above market objective, in the Ethernet.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of David Barden with Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, just to start off with, I mean recognizing you had an aggressive plan and you were looking at maybe growing revenue sequentially. The reality is core revenues came in above the low end of the guide. The core revenues are in line with Street expectations. The headline revenue miss is mostly on equipment revenue.","So if you kind of look out with respect to the industry dynamic, I guess, I would love to hear maybe Jeff and Glen, kind of weigh in on how important it is that we're taking a four player market competing for the national and global enterprise services business and turning it into a three-player market, and how you think that that is going to change share dynamics and pricing dynamics, that'd be helpful?","And then second, Sunit, I think you talked about kind of a 4.2 times leverage today, a goal of 3 times to 4 times. You know at this moment in time and probably most likely tomorrow, the return on purchasing stock is actually a lot higher than anything you could do on the balance sheet right now. As you look at what's happening to your stock and the big divergence between your confidence in the dividend and the market's kind of lack of confidence, how do you arbitrage that and could you take advantage of that in the market with the cash you're generating today? Thanks.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. Dave, I'll tackle that one first. So I think with all these things, there is a balance between leverage. And as you correctly point out, dividend yield is sitting in double-digits, which makes it very attractive to buy back stock. I think that our focus really in the first year is to drive the operating performance, make sure we are delivering on the synergies and we've got plans that we're executing on to drive the transformation that Jeff talked about. And then we'll see where we are over the next year from an EBITDA growth and where the stock's traded at then. And no, it's not lost on us that there's an arbitrage there. I think just in the near-term, we're going to focus on driving the operating performance and then continue to study that and take a look at that, but probably nothing in the short term, but we are keenly looking at that.","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","David, I'll kick off on your question about the market and what happens as we go from a four-player market to a three-player market, I don't really think about it that way. I worry about one player in the market and that's CenturyLink. And we know from history that if we perform well, if we execute well, our customers buy our services. If we sell the right product, we can make money at those products and deliver for our customers. Pricing dynamics and share dynamics, I hope that we get a greater share of our customer spend, that we become more integrated into their business and more essential for their success.","We see that that once a customer starts buying services from us, they continue to buy more and more, and so we see that trend and we want to continue that. But pricing dynamics is less related to the number of players in the market and more to technology transitions and technology substitutions. And one of the things that over the last 20 years, we've gotten pretty good at making sure that the pricing dynamics in the market that we're comfortable with them.","We've talked a lot, Sunit and I have both talked a lot and I know Glen and Stewart have about pricing over the years, but that's not a primary driver in our financials. The primary drivers are, are we able to meet our customers' needs and sell them more services? We deal with the pricing, downward pressures pretty well. And they're not near as aggressive as they used to be.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And I'll just say, and I agree with what Jeff said that how we look at the market, we have a real opportunity now with the combined company here to really leverage our expansive network with the global reach we have, the amount of fiber, 100,000 fiber-connected buildings with working in 60 countries, we also have a lot more traffic on-net, we control the customer experience better, we can drive better profitability.","In addition, we can leverage the new products and service each company brings, we have some unique products like CenturyLink's SD-WAN product that Jeff was talking about earlier, and the SIP product that Level 3 brings to the table. These are the kind of things we can leverage and really look forward to driving better penetration and win in market share.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. And then if I could, just ask one last question as a follow-up. Sunit, any kind of one-time items that affected the quarter positively or negatively on revenue or costs?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","No, just the usual number of items you see in any given quarter. So nothing unusual.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, guys.","R. Stewart Ewing - CenturyLink, Inc.","Nothing for either company there, David.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","All right. Thanks for taking my questions. First, sort of going back to the synergy targets, a footnote in the memorandum and order that the FCC authored approving the deal noted that you guys have raised the synergy estimates you had submitted to them. But the numbers were redacted. Are those numbers you plan on sharing with us at some point or are those going to stay close to the vest?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Are you talking about part of the normal SEC filings around the time of the announcement?","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","No, the FCC.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'm sorry?","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","The FCC.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Oh, the FCC?","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Yeah.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So I mean, again, I \u2013 I mean the only comment I'd make is what I said earlier which is that as we \u2013 we've looked at what we can do here and our confidence where we're executing in line with what we've talked about. But I think the risk in what we outline is quite a bit diminishes because we've had the last year to study that and now put an execution plan in progress.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And maybe one for Glen. In the beginning of the year, I forgot the exact stats, but you outlined a sales pipeline that was substantially in excess of what it had been in prior quarters. How can we haven't seen the growth implied by that pipeline really flow through into the numbers?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Part of the issue is that we have a lot \u2013 ended up with a lot of concern with customers in just with bringing these companies together. Questions like, which network were they going to be on, questions about who their teams would be. Just a lot of uncertainty. That's part of the issue.","I think we had \u2013 I think our sales folks were a little overoptimistic with stuff that they had in the funnel early on as well, so I think that was part of it. But I do believe that, going forward, with a new network and the new sales management team we have in place now, we have an opportunity to really do a better job with that forecast, number one, but also in bringing real revenue to the table. So we're confident in the sales teams we have out there, the leadership we have now to drive real performance.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Have you been able to go back and mitigate some of the concerns that the customers have had, talk about what the combined company is going to bring the table and that they're comfortable with it?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, we've been \u2013 Jeff and I both and others have been on the phone with our key customers across the country, talking to them about the combined company, what we're doing together, how the networks are going to work. We still can't answer all their questions, but we're there for them and we're in a continual process of contacting those customers and working with each \u2013 the CTOs, CIOs, and CEOs of these \u2013 of our major customers across the country.","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And Nick, I don't think that \u2013 none of the customers I've talked to have concerns about whether this is good for them, good for the industry, good for our ability to offer products and services that meet their needs.","I think someone want to know, well, I'm going to spend more with you, am I going to get a better discount? If I wait until after the close, am I going to get a better price? I think there are some of those things that have gone on, but nobody's come to me and said or anybody that I've gone to has said, wait a minute, we're really concerned about this. No, they think it's good. They think we're a stronger company. They think we have the ability to bring the quality of both networks to bear for them. They think that we have better products as a combined business. There are always concerns about, are you going to mess things up during integration? But for the most part, I think our customers are very comfortable with this and think it's a very positive outcome for them in doing business with CenturyLink.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And I'm getting the same feedback from folks I'm talking with.","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Good to hear. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. And, Stewart, good luck and thanks for all your help over the years. Sunit, can you talk about, with your synergy assumptions, what are you kind of assuming for revenues, I mean, can this be a positive revenue growth company at some point and maybe just rough idea on the timing of that? Thanks.","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think the simple answer is yes. And I think the transformation that Jeff was talking about in terms of the experience with customers being digital, making it easier for our employees to serve our customers and also just how we go to market. I think the combination of all those things combined with the network reach we have, we should be able to win more in the marketplace as a combined company than we have separately.","So I think that you will, for a start, seeing that on the Enterprise side of the business. And similarly, as Jeff pointed out, I think even on the Consumer side, we think there's opportunity to do better. So I think in summary, that's what we are focused on, meaning driving profitable growth to the EBITDA and free cash flow line, but clearly having not \u2013 making sure we don't lose our sight in terms of trying to work on improving our revenue growth trends.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And on the network and infrastructure side, you would seem to have a very, very high quality and very good network on the Enterprise side and obviously, the Consumer's lagging a little bit. I mean, should we think about it a little bit of a shift maybe from CapEx emphasis from Enterprise to Consumer at this point?","Jeff Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","No, I think, look, we've been closed for eight days, so we'll work on exactly how we're going to allocate our capital going forward. But I think that our capital needs to be allocated to drive the customer experience and that's true for the Consumer business. That's true for the Enterprise business. We need to get closer and closer to the customer with fiber. We need to build infrastructure to drive the simplification of the way that the customers interface with us. And the more we do that, the more we focus on driving a differentiated customer experience, the more \u2013 over time, that will equate to not only reducing costs and higher profitability and better free cash flow, but, over time, will also translate into better growth.","Customers will churn at a lower rate. They'll buy more services from us. And so that is really how we're going to continue to invest. And as I said and as Sunit said and Stewart alluded to, we need to continue to invest that capital in driving our business forward. And so we think that there's real opportunities to do that both in the Consumer business and in the Enterprise business. I think some of those may have different growth trajectories, but we think they have all that we can drive better profit out of all of them.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","And sorry, lastly, on the broadband side, the cable companies have been very good about just upgrading customer speeds annually or every other year. Your percentage of customers or customers below 20 megs, can you upgrade a lot of them voluntarily to 20 megs or are these just customers in areas that can't get 20 megs?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We certainly, we'll have an opportunity to upgrade them as we build out more of the plan and expand on the \u2013 or follow this path we've set for investment. One example is what Stewart mentioned earlier is the CAF-II investments. We're upgrading those customers to higher speeds, providing greater opportunities. And those were in the \u2013 the most areas that have very low speeds. But even the 20 megabits with our 40-megabit expansion targets and our 100-megabit expansion targets, we're going to be able to upgrade a lot of those customers going forward.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Lisa Lam with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Spencer for Simon. I think most of our questions have been answered. So just a quick one. There was a noticeable improvement in Enterprise legacy revenue and it grew quarter-over-quarter versus consistent prior declines. Anything \u2013 any noticeable changes in that segment that drove that improvement?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Nothing real noticeable that we know of, Spencer, that I've seen anyway.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","We'll follow up \u2013 Kristie and Tony can follow-up with you on that.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our last question for today will be from the line of Ana Goshko with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks very much getting me in. Just a couple of follow-ups. So on the first topic, so, Sunit, two follow-ups on the debt side. So one, you talked about the goal to de-lever below 4 times. So do you plan to achieve that through actual debt pay down with free cash flow after the dividend? Or is that really going to be driven by EBITDA growth?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","My comment on there was essentially being driven by EBITDA growth. With the free cash flow generation, we have options to either pay down debt or buy back stock. But I was really focused on just EBITDA growth driving the leverage down.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then just another quick one. I think at Level 3, you spent some years managing a complex capital structure. But now, it's even gotten more complex. You've got $39 billion of debt and really a lot of different constituents because you've got debt from the Qwest days and Embarq days and Level 3 days and et cetera. So do you plan to simplify the capital structure or how do you plan to sort of access the debt market to refi and raise capital going forward?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So I think it will be on several fronts and over several years. Our overall goal is to simplify their capital structure. There are many ways to do that, but it will take some time. The key point in the short term is to drive down our overall leverage. And then the question is how do you go from the number of entities we have now? Shrink by one, shrink by one more and then you are down to one. But it's going to take a few years. Don't have the exact journey lined out, but some will also depend on market conditions and driving down our leverage. But our overall goal is to simplify it.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And just final question on the dividend payment. I know this has been discussed a lot and you've expressed strong commitment to it. But, I guess, the question is what we've seen with these telecom dividends in particular is oftentimes how the market decides, right? And when shareholders are not giving you credit for the dividend, companies often decide that there's a better use of the capital. So why is the dividend that you are paying now the right number?","Sunit Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Well, so I would say a couple of things. One, we are not like other telecom companies that have been challenged in this regard. So our revenue mix, our scale, our reach, our profit trajectory in terms of what we can do from a synergy perspective, from a transformation perspective that can also alter their revenue trajectory, growth trajectory. So very different from any of the other telecom cases you might be thinking about.","And I think the point was not that we are just committed to the dividend, I think I was also underlying, I'm highly confident that we'll be able to maintain the dividend over the next few years, so I don't see any issue with that per se. Now obviously, to do that, we're going to have to execute well from an integration perspective and from a transformation perspective.","The question on is that the right capital allocation? You always have debates about whether you should do stock buybacks or dividends. But at this point in time, we think that that is a very good way of returning capital to shareholders and illustrates our confidence in the businesses' ability to generate free cash flow. And as Jeff pointed out, we're going to be very focused on driving that free cash flow per share.","Anastazia Goshko - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you very much, Sunit.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay, thank you. And in closing, obviously, we're very pleased with the completing the acquisition of Level 3. With that transaction, we've strengthened our network focus, we've strengthened our management team, we're positioned as one of the world's leading network services companies. And we're looking forward to take advantage of the expanded network, international network we have, the increased fiber access we have today with 100,000 buildings there.","We're wanting to take advantage of the enhanced products that the company is bringing together. We have a laser focus on delivering a great customer experience, improving the cash flows and driving profitable growth in the months ahead.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis - Vice President Investor Relations, CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Syed, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2016 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to Slide 2, you will find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for third quarter and full year 2016 and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide, as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in those forward-looking statements.","As you move to Slide 3, we ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are available on our earnings release and on our website at ir.centurylink.com.","And now as you move to Slide 4, your host for today's call is Glen Post, Chief Executive Officer and President of CenturyLink. Joining Glen will be Stewart Ewing, CenturyLink's Chief Financial Officer, and also available during the question and answer portion of today's call will be Dean Douglas, CenturyLink's President of Sales & Marketing.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay through August 11, 2016 and a webcast replay of our call will be available through August 25, 2016. Anyone listening to a taped or a webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of August 3, 2016 and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or viewed.","And now as you move to Slide 5, I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining our call today as we discuss our second quarter results and provide an update on our key operational initiatives, as well as provide guidance for next quarter and discuss our outlook in our business.","As we begin on Slide 6, we had solid second quarter 2016 financial results. Our total revenue and core revenue were in-line with our guidance. We also did a good job managing our expenses during the quarter, which resulted in operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share that exceeded the top end of our guidance range. We continue to see good demand for our high-bandwidth data services from our Business customers, as revenue grew more than 8% year-over-year. And we grew year-over-year consumer strategic service revenue approximately 5.5%. So, overall, a very good quarter financially.","On the other hand, our subscriber results were below our expectations, which I will discuss in more detail little later in the call. One last point before we leave the overview, the strategic review process for our colocation business continues to move forward and while we have work left to do, we remain optimistic about the level of interest and the prospects for a positive outcome. We expect to finalize this process in the late third quarter to early fourth quarter timeframe.","As we've said previously, our principal focus is on the sale of all or a portion of the data centers, but we also have other alternatives should our process not result in a sale. We believe these are valuable assets and we are committed to realizing that value for CenturyLink and our shareholders, while continuing to provide a strong colocation service offering for our customers.","Now let's turn to the discussion of our operational focus and the financial results. Continuing into Slide 7. As I shared with you last quarter, CenturyLink entered 2016 with a renewed focus on improving the lives of our customers by connecting them to the power of the digital world. This is an important reminder that our principal operational focus is providing our customers the network connections and related services they need to power their lives, their businesses and their communities. We will continue to provide a range of hosting, cloud, IT and managed services to our business customers and video and other services to our consumer customers.","Our success in growing these services, though, is tied to our enabling and delivering excellent network connections and we are focused on four key operational initiatives to drive achievement of that key objective.","So as we move to Slide 8, first, we're focused on driving penetration of existing network and adjacent capabilities. The network is the foundation of the value we deliver to our customers and we believe maximizing penetration of enabled network capabilities is critical to our success.","This initiative is really about execution. We have enabled a great deal of capability into our network and we have to drive higher sustained levels of market penetration to earn an attractive return on that investment. We're seeing some positive results on this front as both business and consumer data revenues grew during the quarter and we achieved over 21% penetration of our year end 2015 GPON-enabled addressable units. The 8% growth we saw in business high-bandwidth data services was the result of strong growth in Ethernet and MPLS services in the second quarter 2016.","We believe these trends validate the value and relevance of our service offering and we are working hard to expand and improve them. For example, in the business segment, our new sales and marketing leadership team has refined our customer base into more tightly targeted customer groups and key verticals, and is tailoring discrete product and the go-to-market strategies for each group and vertical. We believe this will improve our business customer engagement, and drive greater sales execution.","We're also expanding the scope of our partnership channel to drive more sales through partnerships with major software and technology companies. On the consumer side, we're continuing to pivot toward the sale of higher speed, higher-value bundled offerings to better credit quality customers. These customers have a higher ARPU, lower churn and a much higher lifetime value than lower speed, lower credit, standalone broadband customers. We believe this is the right approach for the long-term health of our business, even though it does have an impact on broadband units, some of which we saw during the second quarter.","As I referenced earlier, during the second quarter, our high-speed data customers declined by over 65,000. I'd like to make a couple of comments about those results. These broadband additions for the quarter were below our expectations driven, we believe, in part, by our focus on acquiring higher-value bundled customers and less emphasis on standalone broadband customers.","We did expect broadband additions to be affected by the pivot away from the standalone broadband customers, but the impact was greater than we anticipated. From an out standpoint, about 20% of the decline was driven by a higher than expected number of slow and nonpaying customer churn. A significant percentage of the churn is related to standalone broadband customers who are less loyal than our traditional bundled customers.","Also, there are underlying indicators of strength in the market, as we've seen a continued increase in the number of net adds at the 40 megabits and higher speeds which we expect will deliver future benefits through lower churn and higher ARPU. We expect unit trends to improve in the second half of the year as the effects of the changes in our go-to-market and customer retention programs begin to take effect.","Moving now to investing with discipline and a network-first focus. As I said earlier, we believe the best potential to grow our business is to focus on enabling and delivering fast, reliable, technologically advanced broadband access and related services. And during the second quarter 2016, we continued to expand our capabilities. We believe we have enabled one of the largest deployments of Software Defined Networking, SDN and Network Function Virtualization, NFV, capabilities in the market. These technologies allow us to provide advanced network functionality and deliver much more efficiently than traditional deployments.","Also in late June, we announced the launch of our CenturyLink SD-WAN, software-defined wide area networking service. Today, we have dozens of customers and proof of concept trials and are working over 100 potential sales opportunities. We will continue to invest to build this type of intelligence and efficiency into our broadband access network.","From a broadband access standpoint, I want to take a few minutes to discuss our network evolution plan with you. What we think it takes to be competitive where we are today and our plans to ensure we are keeping pace both with customer demand and competitive market.","First, I want to make a point about speed enablement. Our view is that we should always enable the highest speed that technology and market economics allow. We put fiber everywhere it makes sense to do so. But we also believe our access technologies, such as vectoring, bonding, and GFAS can deliver market competitive speeds when the cost of fiber deployment becomes prohibitive.","Let me walk you through some of those numbers as we move to Slide 9. What you see here is an estimate of the bandwidth requirements of what we would describe as a heavy usage consumer customer, a household streaming six streams of HD video, including two streams of 4K video, a group HD call, a couple of HD gamers, multiple bit Torrent downloads, and multiple music streams.","As you can see even in this relatively high usage case, which is well beyond the vast majority of users' activity, can be met with speeds of less than 100 megabits. And that aligns with our own experience. We see speeds of 40 megabits to 100 megabits as competitive today in virtually all of our markets. We expect that usage curve to continue to increase over time, moving to the 100 megabits or 200 megabits range over the next several years. And certainly there be users who will seek the gigabit connection, but for the vast majority of consumers, we see 100 megabits or 200 megabits as being more than sufficient to meet market demand for a number of years.","With that in mind, let's move to Side 10 and take a look at where we are today with the broadband speed deployment and where our access enablement plan takes us over the next several years. We're confident we can accomplish these broadband speeds within the confines of our existing capital budget levels, and this is based on currently available compression and access technologies and average cost of deployment, which we hope will improve over time. By year-end 2018, we expect to enable speeds of greater than 40 megabits to 85% of our top 25 markets and to reach more than 55% of those markets with more than 100 megabits, with a lot of that improvement coming over the next 12 to 18 months.","And while not depicted on this chart, across all of our markets, this will represent about 50% of addressable units receiving 40 megabits and higher speeds, and more than 30% of addressable units receiving 100 megabits and higher speeds by year-end 2018.","By the time we get to year-end 2019, we expect to have almost 11 \u2013 or about 11 million addressable units, representing 42% of total addressable units across all of our markets, capable of receiving 100 megabits and higher. And in our top 25 markets, over 70% of addressable units are expected to have 100 megabits and higher speeds. At this time, we also expect to have approximately 3 million addressable units enabled for 1 gigabit and higher speeds across all of our markets.","Obviously, changes in technology, cost of deployment, and market factors could cause us to reassess our actual deployment \u2013 to be a little lower or a little higher, but while these details may vary, the point is, we believe we can deploy very competitive speeds within our existing capital plans. And while our investment plans assume capital intensity at current levels over the next several years, we do anticipate our capital intensity to return to historical averages over time.","As we move to Slide 11, our next operational initiative is to create exceptional customer experiences. As enabled speeds become more aligned among competitors and are more consistently in excess of the customers' needs, we believe customer experience becomes more relevant to the buying decision. Under our new sales and marketing leadership, we're intensifying our effort to go-to-market with a customer-focused approach.","For example, we're in the process of reducing the many variations of one of our consumer products. This will result in fewer, easier-to-understand, and easy-to-provision offerings. This will improve our customer experience and drive efficiencies into our operations. We've also continued an intense effort to accelerate provisioning of our business network services, and we've seen a 25% improvement in Ethernet service intervals since the first of this year and increased order velocity by approximately 60%. Again, this improvement drives a better customer experience, drives efficiencies in our operation, and accelerates the order-to-cash cycle.","Finally, we've increased the level of folks in our call centers in first call resolution for our customers. This focus on first call resolution is another change we believe may have affected our broadband additions for the quarter as we focused more on the customers' issues rather than selling, but we believe the improved customer experience will improve customer retention and improve revenue over time.","Finally, our fourth operational initiative is to optimize operating and capital efficiencies. We know we have to continue to realign our legacy cost structure. I think our operating expenses for the second quarter show that we are focused on operating efficiencies. However, realizing the level of efficiencies we require will take more than just good cost management. We have several initiatives underway to drive even greater efficiencies. We simplify our product offerings; we are also in the process of simplifying our billing platforms. This is a complex, multiyear project that we believe will simplify our systems, infrastructure, improve our customer experience and deliver operating efficiencies.","We're energized with this focus we are driving into our business. We believe we have a clear strategic direction, and by delivering on our key operational initiatives, we will successfully build on CenturyLink's history of delivering value for both our customers and our shareholders.","Now, I will turn the call over to Stewart for discussion of our financial results and guidance. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Thank you, Glen. Over the next few minutes, I'll review the financial results for the second quarter and provide an overview of the third quarter 2016 guidance we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Now moving to Slide 13, I'll review a few highlights from our second quarter results. Please note that I will be reviewing some of the results excluding special items as outlined in our earnings release and associated financial schedules.","As Glen mentioned earlier, we achieved solid financial results for the second quarter and operating revenues were $4.4 billion on a consolidated basis, a 0.5% decrease from second quarter 2015 operating revenues. This decrease was primarily driven by lower legacy revenues offsetting an approximate $50 million increase in high-cost support revenues due to CAF Phase 2 support, higher consumer strategic services and increased business high-bandwidth data services. I might point out here that as indicated in our release, this quarter we moved private line from strategic to legacy revenue. Prior quarters have been restated to reflect this change.","Core revenue defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue was $3.97 billion for the second quarter, a decrease of only 1.2% from the year ago period. Our strategic revenues grew 5.2% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in high-bandwidth data services and higher consumer strategic revenues.","Operating income was $650 million, an increase of $101 million from second quarter of 2015. We generated operating cash flow of approximately $1.65 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 37.5%.","Cash expenses for the second quarter declined $48 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower employee-related costs. Free cash flow, defined as operating cash flow, less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures along with the cash impact of pension and OPEB cost, stock-based compensation and other income was $617 million for the quarter.","Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.36, an increase from $0.26 in the year ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.63, an increase from $0.55 in the second quarter of 2015.","Moving to Slide 14 in our business segment. In the second quarter, the business segment generated $2.6 billion of operating revenues, which decreased $61 million or 2.3% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment was $1.23 billion, an increase of 5% compared to second quarter 2015, and was driven primarily by the continued growth in high-bandwidth data services, partially offset by the decline in hosting revenues. In addition, we had a one-time favorable settlement of approximately $10 million.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 7.4% from second quarter 2015, due primarily to a continuing decline in voice and low bandwidth data services. Our data integration revenues declined $20 million from second quarter 2015, due primarily to lower CPE sales. Total business segment expenses decreased $17 million, or 1.1% from the year ago period, driven primarily by lower employee-related and network expenses partially offset by higher facilities costs.","Now turning to Slide 15, the consumer segment generated $1.49 billion in total operating revenues, a decrease of $9 million, or 0.6% from second quarter 2015. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 5.5% year-over-year to $800 million, driven by year-over-year growth in broadband and Prism TV revenues.","Legacy revenues for the consumer segment declined 6.8% from second quarter a year ago as access line declines were partially offset by select price increases. Operating expenses increased $18 million, or 2.8% compared to the same period a year ago, due to higher Prism TV costs, commissions and marketing expenses, partially offset by reductions in employee cost from lower head count.","Now turning to Slide 16. For third quarter 2016, we expect operating revenues of $4.35 billion to $4.4 billion, core revenues of $3.9 billion to $3.95 billion, and operating cash flow between $1.56 billion and $1.61 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.52 to $0.57.","Third quarter 2016 operating revenues are expected to be lower than second quarter 2016 operating revenues, primarily due to anticipated growth in data integration, high bandwidth data services, broadband, and Prism TV revenues being offset by the expected decline in legacy revenues.","Our anticipated sequential decrease in third quarter operating cash flow compared to second quarter is primarily due to the decline in revenues and expected higher normal seasonal costs. In addition, we expect to have higher than originally anticipated network, sales and marketing costs related to our customer growth plans for the back half of the year.","Although we do not provide free cash flow guidance on a quarterly basis, I want to point one additional item as you're thinking about first half versus second half trends. As you all are probably aware about the news media, earlier this year, we experienced record flooding in Louisiana, and as a result, many parishes in the state were declared as federal disaster areas and eligible for federal relief. As part of this relief, federal and certain state cash taxes related to our first and second quarter tax estimates were delayed until the third quarter of 2016.","For full year 2016, we slightly narrowed our cash taxes estimate to be $400 million to $500 million, and again, most of this will be paid in the last six months of the year.","For full year 2016, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance, although due to the higher expenses outlined earlier, operating cash flow will likely come in towards the lower portion of our range for the year. We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio, however, to be in the low to mid 60% range for 2016.","This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So, at this time I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the question-and-answer portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first question for you, Stewart, is obviously the math of the EBITDA guidance. Even if we look at the very low end of the EBITDA number and do the math for the first three quarters including the midpoint of 3Q guide, it would imply like a 6% increase in 4Q versus 3Q EBITDA. You did have about $178 million of sequential cost cuts last year in the fourth quarter, but you had a very specific program that you were implementing in the second half of the year. Could you kind of talk about why we can get comfortable with that mathematics? And then, again, just on the \u2013 I know you don't give the free cash flow guidance, Stewart, but you generated about $1.4 billion to date, the midpoint of the guide is 1.9%. Is the entire difference really the cash tax payment's timing or does it seem to be kind of steering to the higher end of the range for whatever reason? Thanks.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yes. So, David, the last question first. Basically it's partially cash taxes in the last half of the year, but it's also CapEx because we will spend more CapEx in the last half of the year than we did in the first half of the year, as well as our operating income or our operating cash flow will be expected to decline somewhat in the second half of the year as well.","With regard to the first question, you are correct, but last year, as you pointed out, we cut expenses about $125 million between the third and fourth quarter. We feel comfortable that with coming off seasonality from the third quarter, we'll have a normal reduction in expenses in the fourth quarter, plus we will have programs in place to allow us to be able to cut operating expenses to come in within the guidance range that we're staying with.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. And can you kind of map out some of the specific plans that you have that are going to get you there?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","I guess, we're still working on a few of the things, David, but normally, I mean, just from a seasonality standpoint, there's probably $60 million to $80 million that comes out of the \u2013 that will come out of the fourth quarter this year related to seasonality between what we expect in the third quarter versus what we would expect in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter programs don't have to be quite as robust as they were last year to get us to the $125 million or so that we experienced last year.","Also, we'll have somewhat of a decline in marketing expenses in the fourth quarter because we're ramping up some marketing expenses in the third quarter and we expect that to come back down a little bit in the fourth quarter as well.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I apologize, Stewart, one last one, just a clarification. So, last quarter when you guided down from 1Q to 2Q, you kind of cited seasonal cost pressures which didn't materialize and you ended up above the high end of the range. Are we actually seeing the seasonal expenses coming through now that are more likely or are you expecting these kind of seasonal costs to come down the pike?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. So about $20 million in the second quarter and about $30 million or so in the third quarter.","David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up on the commentary around the capital intensity. It sounds like the way we should think about it is, based on your investment plans, you do expect capital intensity to be up for the next several years. How should we think about it in terms of magnitude? And at what point do you expect capital intensity to return to historical averages over time?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. Amir, I was not saying that the capital intensity would be up. It just won't come down for a couple of years, two, three years, as we spend \u2013 you know, we've had \u2013 our capital intensity has been a little higher than the industry for a couple of years and we expect that level to continue. We do not \u2013 we believe we can hit these objectives in terms of broadband speeds, improving the network and enhancing the network with SDN and the other services that we're putting into the network, all the technologies within the current capital budget, which is about $3 billion today.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. That's very helpful. And then, I was wondering if we could talk a bit more on the subscriber trends on the high-speed data customers. It sounds like there's a shift in terms of focus on the bundled offering in terms of those types of subscribers. But, I seem to recall, in your last call, you did mention that there was a deferral in certain price increases that you had hoped to get out of the high-speed broadband. Just trying to put two and two together there. Is there any color that you can provide us in terms of the competitive landscape or what you are seeing from that front that gives you confidence that you can still return to targeting those higher value bundled customers?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do you want to take that one? I'm going to let Dean Douglas.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","So, actually, there are two issues here. So the first issue is with regard to the trend towards or shift that we are going to make or are making towards bundled customers. So that's an initiative we've started and continue to pivot our customers from a pure or single-focused high-speed Internet type of customer towards one which is bundled. That is something that drives better ARPU, as well as a longer lifetime revenue base for that customer.","The second piece, though, is with regard to the price increases. The price increases, we saw some of the price increases take effect in the first half and we're continuing to drive some of those price increases into the second half, and we'll see those manifest themselves in the second half as well.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. Just to follow up, excuse me, bundled customers, what does that mean? What are you bundling? Because your video reach just isn't that wide. Are you looking to bundle with voice? What should we be thinking about here?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We're primarily looking at double- and triple-play. So it includes voice and other services that we would bundle with our high-speed Internet. And as I mentioned, those customers tend to stay with us much longer than those that are just that pure play.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then it looks like the managed hosting business continues to decline here. Can you talk about any color around that, as well as the sort of data center sale process? Any update there, either in terms of the process or thoughts on how to use the proceeds? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. First of all, the process is going well. We have narrowed down the group of final contestants for the property and we have ongoing discussions, negotiations with that group. We feel good about where we are headed there and we think we'll be successful in getting the transaction done.","Again, as I said before, it will be, third quarter, maybe early fourth quarter before we finalize a transaction. We have not yet made final decisions regarding the use of proceeds from that. We'll address this as we get closer to a transaction. We'll obviously consider a number of alternatives, stock buybacks, debt reduction, investment and strategic services, and other possible areas. We just haven't \u2013 we're waiting until we get a little closer to the close to really decide how to best spend those funds. So our primary goal, of course will be to utilize the cash in the very most effective way we can to drive long-term shareholder value. That will be our objective.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Spencer for Simon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I may. Can you update us on what you are hearing in terms of the latest on special access? And then second, what's the latest outlook for returning to revenue break even? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, special access, we're working with the FCC. It's a complex issue. It deals with the provisioning of wholesale special access service to wireless providers and to carriers, CLECs. In our discussions with the FCC, we've been in continuous discussions with them. We believe that they intend to move on an order to move it to resolution this year.","They have obviously a limited amount of time to do so. They are trying to move quickly. We're in conversation with almost all the industry stakeholders including the cable companies, CLECs, other industry players in hopes of negotiating a workable solution that we can bring to the FCC to achieve a balanced reform. The FCC order will likely address the definition of competitive and noncompetitive markets, as well as prospective rates charged to carriers and CLECs and wireless providers.","We are on record and in direct conversations with Chairman Wheeler and other commissioners that the vast majority of our markets are fully competitive and that those rates should not be regulated. So that's been a major position of ours and we think we have \u2013 we can show that. We believe the commission is using data from cable TV companies that is three years old and the cable companies have actually said this data is not really correct. So we are encouraging the commission, really, to step back and use the most recent data that's available out there to make these decisions.","Because of the many paths that this special access really could take, we are not ready to provide a range of possible outcomes. It's just too complex. We do expect to know more in a few weeks. We are cautiously optimistic that some form of compromise can be reached that the FCC can work with to achieve some of their objectives and make this palatable for all the players. We know change has to take place, but we believe there are ways to do it without being punitive to any specific group of players here.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of updating your comments in terms of, I think, at the end of 2015, you were talking about revenue break-even in 12 months to 18 months. Is that still part of the plan?","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","Yeah. And, Spencer, we still think that there's a possibility that by the last quarter of the year, we could get to potentially revenue stability, and would still expect EBITDA stability to come 18 months or so probably after that. As we've stated before, our results won't be perfectly linear. But we're confident that we are on a path to get to revenue stability and growth and EBITDA stability and growth as well.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd add one comment related to a prior question on the bundling. We are bundling our services with DirecTV services, video services where we don't have Prism TV services available. We're also about to trial an over-the-top product. We've had one trial and we're going to have another more robust trial of a over-the-top product that we expect to be able to bundle, and we are bundling voice as well.","Spencer S. Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you. First, can you talk to us a little bit about the consumer products that you say you are rationalizing? What exactly is going out there? And then, Stewart, I'd like to follow-up on what you said about the OTT product. What will that look like? Will that be a similar \u2013 taking Prism as an OTT and avoiding a set-top box or something like that, or a smaller, skinnier package? Give us a little more color on that.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","Okay. So, first of all, with regard to product consolidation rationalization, we're going to take 40 speed products, as an example, down to seven. So that's the extent or the level of rationalization that we're going to go forward with in our consumer products. You can imagine the complexity when you've got 40 different product offerings to speeds, and so we really do need to rationalize those.","With regard to the OTT or the over-the-top products, we are going to be going forward with skinny bundles, and so as was mentioned just a moment ago, we piloted this in one market and we expect to go forward with a broader pilot towards the end of the year and really test the market in terms of pricing as well as the ability to penetrate the marketplace with this OTT offering to compliment what we have in the Prism markets.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I might add to that Dean, with the skinny bundle, we'll also offer the broadcast network channels with that, which is a little different from a lot of \u2013 some of the offers that are out there today. So we think that will be a differentiator as we bring those local channels with the over-the-top cable channels.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","And it will be an app-based product, Frank, so that you can access it through an app on your smart TV.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. Too bad they won't let you do that kind of rationalization with some of the regulated voice products, but thanks for the questions.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Niknam from Deutsche Bank.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. One, you mentioned refining your go-to-market strategy in both consumer and business. Maybe if you can give us some more color on what's actually going on there and when you expect these efforts to produce results and improved volumes and revenue growth? And then just on broadband, if you can help us think through the pressure this quarter, whether it was more of a gross add or a churn issue? And I have one more follow-up. Just in terms of trying to figure out the impacts from the deferral of rate hikes that was discussed, whether those actually have come through yet or not? Thanks.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","Okay. So, with regard to refining the go-to-market, what we've done is we've transitioned from a go-to-market that is really driven by product to a go-to-market that's more market sensitive and market focused. So, customer groups, much more than product groups. And so, for example, we've got seven routes to market in our new go-to-market construction, and so they've got large accounts, SMB and so on. A lot of those, to differentiate not only the product offerings we take to those market segments, but also how we bundle or create product groupings, solutions, that we're going to take to the marketplace as well.","So when we think about the markets in the large account space, what we call global markets, it's one that really is driven by vertical market penetration. So we've got a couple of vertical markets that we're going forward with today. We'll be adding more as we go forward. Those vertical markets, especially for large accounts, are absolutely essential in order to create credibility and strong relationships with our customer base.","So that's where we are with regard to the go-to-market in the business space and how we're going to address those market opportunities. We are starting to see some traction in the marketplace, and I believe that the market structure that we've implemented today is something that our customers have looked for, in not only our business, but in our competitors, and I think we're seeing that benefit in the way in which we are interacting with our customers and the opportunities that we're seeing in the marketplace for those solutions.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","And then regarding the pricing increase that we talked about, almost very, very low first half of the year. We saw almost none come in. But second half of the year, we expect a little less than $10 million in the second half of the year in price increases. That's about 20% of the increase we are putting in place. We should see the rest of that in 2017.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then on the broadband activity for the quarter, whether parsing through gross adds versus churn, if you can give us any more color there?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Do you want to answer that?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","Yeah. So with regard to the ins and outs, so we had a pretty significant number of ins on our business. We continue to sell, especially in the \u2013 as was mentioned earlier, in the 40 megabit space. And so our customers are really looking forward to greater speed and bandwidth as we go forward. We also saw that the pure customers continued to churn. And we've talked about that. The churn level for our pure customers, or standalone high-speed customers, is double that of what we were seeing in those bundled customers. So very, very significant churn rate in those customers. So we saw a significant number of outs in that pure space.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Matt, if you look at the overall broadband losses, it was about 50% due to the lower end and about 50% due to increased churn. So it's about 50% both ways. Pretty well balanced as far as the impact.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Amy Yong from Macquarie. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thanks. Two questions. So first on just operational efficiencies and, as you have agreed, I guess the business and consumer segment, what kind of margin expansion should we expect in 2017 and 2018? And my second question is on the data center, the strategic return. What type of considerations would do real \u2013 I guess an outright sale and point you to perhaps staying in the colocation business? Thank you.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","First of all, with respect to margins, we're going to continue to see some margin decline in the consumer segment because basically we will still be losing the legacy revenue that's higher margin, and the revenue that we are adding will be more strategic revenue in nature. To the extent that's video, the margin on that is substantially lower. To the extent it's high-speed Internet, that margin is better. So, overall the margin will continue to come down some.","The important thing, I think, is that over time we intend to be able to grow revenue and stabilize EBITDA and really start growing both revenue and EBITDA on a consolidated basis.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And regarding the data center business, we expect \u2013 fully expect right now that it will be a sale; however, so we are not limiting ourselves to that. The colo business continue to be an important part of our future, and we will be in the managed services business. We have big data capabilities. We're in managed hosting, so all those [indiscernible] having data center capabilities \u2013 colo capabilities. So we will continue to be in this business.","However, we think there are opportunities to approach it differently if we don't have a sale. We think there are partnership opportunities that would reduce the load as far as the capital requirements on CenturyLink. And we can do partners with other companies or ways to share overheads with other companies. So we have a couple of partnership opportunities we think are legitimate, real that could be beneficial for shareholders if we don't get the valuation from a sale that we expect that we require.","Amy Yong - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, Glen, just thinking about the high-speed database that currently exists. You talked about the single play and the higher churning, I guess, nonpaid discos. When you think about your overall subscriber base, is there a percentage of that base that you think could be at risk as we think about progressing over the next few quarters? And then, I guess just on the speed offered by cable competition or others in that top 25 markets, how does that stack up against the way you guys are thinking about CenturyLink for the future?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Mike, first of all, on the \u2013 as far as the base at risk, we still have a lot of pure play standalone Internet customers out there that we expect to impact us going forward. We think by early second half of the year we should be filtered through those to a great degree and we'll see that churn rate and that falloff come down. We'll see more stabilization and an increase in ARPU at that point. So, there's some still out there, but it's early second half of the year we should see that subside quite a bit, the impact of that.","As far as the speeds that we are projecting, certainly in some markets the cable company roll out higher speeds. However, we have a lot more GPON out there than anybody \u2013 than anyone has, any of the cable competitors have. We have 40 megabits, so we're 30% of our markets today, that's going up significantly. We expect to have close to 4 million homes with access to 100 megabits or more by year end, homes and businesses. So we believe we can be very competitive. We don't feel we have to compete on just speed, but on service, on the service of our products we are selling. And that's the chart I showed you. We showed earlier that if you can get the same service level with lower investment, lower speeds, then we think that's the right thing to do. We don't think we should go out and invest for the sake of investing where it doesn't make sense in low density markets. Again, as I said, everywhere we can take fiber economically, we are going to do it, but that's not going to be in all of our markets by any means.","Mike L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you for calling. Our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey, guys. Two questions. Where do you think the low end broadband subscribers are going? I would think you would have prices at the lower end that are quite a bit below cable. Is that the wireless? And maybe just at a high level, how do your broadband prices compare to cable at this point? And then secondly, can you give us some more color on SDN and NFV? It sounds like you're deploying it very aggressively, what your experience has been to date, maybe what kind of suppliers you are using or where you've seen the most OpEx and CapEx savings with SDN and NFV? Thank you.","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","So with regard to the first part of your question, where do we think the low end broadband subscribers are going? We think they are increasing their speeds. They are moving up speed in the marketplace. There probably are some cord cutters, but we don't see that as being very, very significant at this juncture. We really do see them increasing their speeds.","With regard to SDN, NFV and the approach that we're taking, we've got several pilots in place today. We're looking at broader market or geographies for those customers. And we're really thinking about the reach that we get from the SDN, NFV implementations versus the way in which we are traditionally going after the MPLS and Ethernet marketplaces. And that ability to take our network and provide significant services beyond just what's offered today, in MPLS and in the Ethernet marketplace across a broader geography is what's compelling for our customer base at this juncture.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And how do you think your base broadband prices compare to cable prices at this point?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","We believe that our prices are lower than the cable offerings at this juncture. Of course, that's during the promotional period.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just two questions. First on the skinny bundles that you're going to be rolling out; I'm curious whether there are any caps on your programming agreements, sometimes that's a key tradeoff that you get with the programmers in order to have a more limited bundle. And then second, on the third quarter marketing initiatives that you're planning that's going to put a little upward pressure on spending, I just want to come back to that. What is the outcome you are looking to achieve and why are you containing that to the third quarter?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll let Aamir Hussain, our CTO, answer the first question about skinny bundles.","Aamir Hussain - Chief Technology Officer & Executive VP","So, the key for getting the skinny bundles to work is having the right level of programming agreements in place. Today on Prism TV service we buy through NCTC. When we launch our TV over-the-top offering, that offering we are negotiating brand new agreements with the broadcasters. And those agreements are not bound by any caps or by franchise agreements. So these are non-franchise-type agreements. They allow us to pretty much have a nationwide reach. And the top four or five, we are doing very, very well on those agreements and we really, really feel very comfortable with the timeline that we have provided.","I would also add that skinny bundles are not just about skinny. We are \u2013 we will be offering multiple genre of packages on top of that. And that will have a very, very positive impact on our ARPU at a cost point which makes sense for the consumer.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And on the...","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","With regard to the marketing efforts and the greater intensity of the marketing spend, in the third quarter, actually, we are looking to not just drive that, the third quarter, but going forward, and so we are going to have a set of marketing programs that will continue to drive our high-speed broadband businesses, but it's not all incremental.","The fact is that we're taking some funds from other marketing programs that are no longer justified and moving them to this increased spend as we go forward. And it allows us to continue to drive our broadband services, especially for those higher end customers.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And what is the metric that's going to tell us if it's working? Is it as simple as looking at an improvement in the broadband net adds?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","It would be an improvement in the broadband net adds. Obviously, that's the primary metric in the consumer space. And by way, when we talk about improvement in the net adds, it's traditional, where the bundled approach as opposed to those pure plays.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you anticipate that in aggregate your broadband sub-base will be growing sequentially in the back end of the year? Or do you still have a little bit you have to work out of the system?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","We still have to work some out of the system with regard to the churn that occurs in our pure or standalone play. We will see that play out through the third quarter, and then we expect that we'll start to see an improvement in the subsequent quarters.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. A couple of follow-ups. First on the guidance for revenues, you had guided to the low end of the guidance range, partly because you had decided not to increase prices. Now that you are taking some selected price increases, can we expect a little bit of a move on the annual revenues? And maybe within that, can you talk about what you are seeing in the wholesale business, both from a wireless backhaul perspective, and other wireless contracts. Some of your peers saw some pressure there. What are you seeing in the market? And third question on CapEx. You said that you expect capital intensity to remain at current levels for a few years, which is about 17% of sales. And then what is a more normalized level that you can get back to? Thank you.","R. Stewart Ewing - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Assistant Secretary","So, Batya, with respect to the revenue guidance, we still believe we'll be at the lower half of the range that we gave for the full year. The price increases that we expect to do \u2013 and by the way, we did price increases in the first half of the year. I just want to make that clear. The $40 million is what we effectively deferred and decided not to do that we had previously planned when we originally gave our 2016 guidance.","Some of that we'll implement now, but the impact of that on the last half of the year is going to really be pretty immaterial. We hope to have some increases in our sales of CPE, which would help improve our revenues somewhat in the back half of the year.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And then on the wholesale business, pressure on wireless backhaul, there continues to be pressure on wireless backhaul. It's very competitive. There's a lot of players out there. The wireless companies have alternatives. So it is continual negotiation going on. Of course, we had a major reduction last year that we talked about this time last year in terms of wireless backhaul agreements, but it's an ongoing issue. We think we can be competitive. We don't expect any major impacts this year, but these negotiations are continual with the wireless carriers and it's very competitive.","The more normalized level of CapEx we can get to, we think there's $300 million or $400 million come out easily out of the $3 billion, so we think $2.5 billion level is certainly achievable, maybe less. It depends on what the opportunities are in terms of driving \u2013 or investing the technology that can drive revenue and margins. But right now we think a more normal level being closer to the $2.5 billion mark.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Rollins from Citi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was just wondering if I could follow back up on some of the CapEx points that you are making. The first thing is, when you talked about the use of proceeds \u2013 possible proceeds for the possible data center sale, you mentioned, I think, reinvestment as a category, and I don't think you've mentioned that in some of the past calls. So, can you talk us through if you did have more capital available, where you might want to put it, how much you think you could invest to have impact on the revenue line and the operations longer term? And then just finally, on data speeds, how much of your customers make decisions based on what they feel they need in terms of speed versus what they are marketed to and what they feel is better for them? And then can you talk us through your strategy to address the way customers are buying the services? Thanks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mike, first of all, the mention of the reinvestment, we consider that in every \u2013 we look at cash flow of any kind. That's part of the consideration. So I wasn't trying to say, well, that's a change. We look at, as I said, we look at stock buybacks, debt reduction, investments and services and other areas of acquisition. We put all the opportunities in there, but the focus again is driving the long-term shareholder value. So, just to give you an example, there may be an opportunity to invest in a certain type of technology we believe could drive short and near term returns, drive real value for us, offset some capital expenditures, offset some of the cash investment in the CapEx. So that's the kind of thing we look at, but there's no change in what we said before.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And if you did have more capital or just cash coming in, is there a certain amount that you feel like you could deploy in the business that would be catalytic for better performance?","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We really haven't made a decision. Certainly there are opportunities there to invest in the business. There's no question about that. We haven't made any decisions as far as should we invest back into the business with some of the funding that comes from the sale of the data center. We just haven't made those decisions yet, but those opportunities are certainly there.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And then just lastly back to my question on how your customers buy services. And in terms of, how you feel they are making the decisions \u2013 do you see them making decisions on what they actually need or do you think it's more of a marketing situation where they might be captivated by the advertisement of better speeds and how you are marketing to your customers based on how you see the decision making process working?","Dean J. Douglas - President-Sales & Marketing","So as you would expect, in the marketplace, there's an over emphasis on speed. And even though the speeds may be well above what the customers' requirements are, there's still that desire to get as much speed as possible. But we have an advantage that, for example, our cable competitors do not have in that we are not shared, and our cable competitors are. And so what we really focus on is the real speed that the customer is going to get, and what they really need going forward from a broadband standpoint and that seems to be very, very effective in communicating to our customers what their real needs are versus what the advertised speed might be in the best of circumstances.","And then, of course, the other piece of the whole speed equation that we try and educate our customers about is the symmetry of speed. So we've got upload and download speeds that are similar, and we're not seeing that in our cable competition. So we talk about that upload and download speed with our customers and the fact that it's symmetrical.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Mike, one thing I might point out on that as well is that, we've always competed with the cable companies at a speed disadvantage and we've always been successful adding customers over the years. And with the network expansion and the emphasis on the network and improving the broadband speeds from a relative standpoint, we will be competing at a much better position than we've been at in the past, and, again, we've been successful in the past. So there's no reason to think we shouldn't be successful in the future with the focus and the emphasis that we're putting on investing in the network to increase our speeds.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for closing remarks.","Glen F. Post - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Syed. And I believe CenturyLink is well positioned to help our customers realize the promise of the power of the digital economy that we talked about. We'll continue to invest in our broadband network and expand our broadband capabilities that we discussed today, that we believe will help meet our customers' needs, help them improve their lives, grow their business. We continue to see excellent opportunities to beat business customer demand for high bandwidth data hosting and IP and managed services. We think that we're going to see that demand grow in the months and years ahead.","Additionally, we are focused on meeting the broadband and video demand we see for consumer customers and are investing to deliver those services that they want and need as we've also discussed today. We have a strong set of assets and we have the financial strength that we believe position us well to invest in our future and to grow our business. So, thank you for being on our call today.

Sir, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2011 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available on our Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","On Slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for 2012, the integration of Qwest and Savvis and other outlooks on our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide, as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements. We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between the non-GAAP financial measures and the GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at www.centurylink.com.","Turning to Slide 3.

Anyone listening to a taped or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of February 15, 2012, and should be considered valid only as of this date, regardless of the date heard or reviewed.","As we move to Slide 4, I'll now turn the call over to your host today, Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2011 performance and share our strategic areas of focus heading into the months ahead. Our results were strong. During the fourth quarter, we continue to invest in key areas of growth, meet our integration objectives and build positive momentum in a number of areas across our business despite a challenging economy and a very competitive business environment.","Now turning to Slide 5. I want to highlight a number of accomplishments we achieved during 2011. First, we completed the acquisitions of Qwest and Savvis, adding strategic high-quality asset to CenturyLink, which further diversified our revenue mix, broadened our portfolio of assets that strengthen CenturyLink's position as a leading communications company. We've also added a global aspect to our business through these transactions. ","Second, during the fourth quarter, we achieved operating revenues above the top end of our fourth quarter revenue guidance. And for full year 2011, we successfully lowered the rate of revenue decline to 3.8% from approximately 5.6% for pro forma full year 2010. We also successfully completed integration of Embarq and made solid progress with the integration of Qwest and Savvis while reaching our full operating expense synergy target for Embarq and exceeding our 2011 operating expense synergy target for Qwest.","From an operating metrics standpoint, the rate of access line loss in our business continue to decline in 2011, improving from 8% at year-end 2010 to 6.6% at the end of 2011.","Additionally, we experienced solid broadband subscriber growth of nearly 240,000 subscribers during 2011, a 4.5% decline -- I'm sorry, improvement. We completed over 1,500 fiber-to-the-tower builds during 2011 and enabled Ethernet services to more than 430,000 exchanges since April 1, 2011. ","Lastly, we expanded our Prism TV product through 5 additional markets and now pass over 1 million homes. We ended 2011 with a penetration rate of about 7% of homes passed. ","Moving to Slide 6. We entered 2012 excited about our business and the prospects for continued top line revenue improvement, as well as customer retention and growth. The chart on this slide illustrates we have slowed the rate of revenue decline on a pro forma basis from roughly 5.6% in 2010 to 3.8% in 2011. We expect to significantly reduce the rate of revenue decline in 2012. This continues our path toward revenue stability and eventual growth as we begin to see our strategic initiatives to have a greater impact on our revenue streams. ","Top line revenue trends improved in 2011 as we began to realize the benefits of our higher index to growth. Nearly 60% of our revenue has now come from business services as a result of the Qwest and Savvis acquisitions. We're also encouraged by our ability to continue to mitigate line loss now at 6.6% from 8% a year ago. ","Our investments in fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-tower, are paying off. Our broadband subscriber growth in fourth quarter is best-in-class among Starbuck [ph] peer group. We have seen a pickup in the legacy Qwest markets in the second half of the year as the extension of our local operating model has begun to gain traction in these large markets.","We're pleased with the overall revenue mix shift in the business. Our strategic revenue, plus Savvis accounts now, it's now the fourth quarter of '11, nearly 44% of our revenue, up from 40% a year ago as we continue to reindex our business to areas of growth. ","We're seeing growth in strategic revenues. They grew over 6% in 2011, and we expect this growth will continue in 2012. Our business markets, strategic revenue growth when adjusting for material private line services accelerated the fourth quarter '11 to nearly 8% as we see continued high demand for next-generation IP services like MPLS and Ethernet.","Turning now to Slide 7. As discussed last quarter, we're focusing our resources in areas that we believe will drive our future growth. They include broadband expansion and enhancement, including fiber-to-the-node deployment, the expansion of CenturyLink's IPTV offering of Prism TV, our fiber-to-the-node initiative and our managed hosting cloud services. We are pleased with the progress we've made on each of these key areas during 2011 and expect to invest in it and to drive results for these initiatives in year 2012 and beyond. ","We continue to make significant investments in expansion and enhancement of our broadband network and achieve a net increase of over 70,000 high-speed Internet customers in this quarter. We also successfully expanded our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure to an additional 340,000 living units during the fourth quarter and into 2011 with 6.1 million fiber-to-the-node-enabled living units. ","Looking forward into 2012, we expect to enable approximately 1 million additional living units in the year and -- end 2012 with about 7.1 million fiber-to-the-node enabled living units.","Now turning to Prism TV, we're focused on expanding our footprint and growing our subscriber base, and we're encouraged by the 30% growth in Prism TV subscribers during the fourth quarter as we ended 2011 with over 70,000 Prism TV subscribers. ","We also continue to see Prism TV have a positive impact on churn and line loss trends, and we continue to experience greater than 90% broadband pull-through rate with our Prism TV sales to new customers. We also look forward to launching Prism TV in our first legacy Qwest market in the coming months.","Continuing with our fiber-to-the-tower initiative on Slide 8. We continue to make progress with fiber-to-the-tower buildout initiative, which strengthens our wireless data transport capacity and enables us to meet the growing data transport needs of wireless carriers in 2012 and beyond. Now during fourth quarter, we completed over 1,250 fiber builds and finished the year with nearly 10,200 fiber-to-the-tower builds completed. We expect to build fiber to another 4,000 to 5,000 towers in 2012. ","Lastly, we remain committed to investing in the managed hosting cloud services space in the months ahead. We believe part of our operation -- this part of our operation has significant potential for growth in the coming months and years. ","As part of our commitment, we expanded our data center footprint during the fourth quarter as we opened one center and added space and centers in 2 other cities to bring our total sellable square footage to 1.3 million by the end of 2011. We anticipate adding another 100,000 additional square feet of sellable space during 2012.","Also, we're pleased to announce Savvis has been recognized by the analyst firm Gartner as a leader in both the Magic Quadrant for Public Cloud Infrastructure as a Service and the Magic Quadrant for Cloud Infrastructure as a Service and Web Hosting. And we believe this esteemed recognition solidifies Savvis' reputation as an industry leader in this space. ","With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results. Stewart?","R. Stewart Ewing","Thank you, Glen. I'll spend the next few minutes reviewing some of the financial highlights for the fourth quarter, and then I'll provide an overview of the guidance that we included in our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon.","Now turning to Slide 10. First, in order to provide more relevant comparisons, I'll be reviewing the financial results on a pro forma basis as if Qwest and Savvis were fully included in the results for all periods. As you can see, we generated strong operating revenues and solid cash flows during the fourth quarter. ","For fourth quarter 2011, operating revenues were $4.653 billion on a consolidated basis, slightly above the top end of our guidance for the quarter, representing a 3.2% decline from pro forma fourth quarter 2010 operating revenues and a sequential increase of 0.4% compared to the prior quarter. ","Strategic revenues grew 4.7% to $2 billion, while our legacy revenues for fourth quarter were $2.2 billion, a decrease of 9.5% from pro forma fourth quarter a year ago. ","On a full year basis, operating revenues declined 3.8%, which was a little better than an anticipated 4% year-over-year decline and a nice improvement over the approximately 5.6% decline in pro forma operating revenues for 2010.","You will recall when we reported earnings last quarter, we outlined and spoke about adjusted diluted earnings per share, similar to what other companies in our industry have done following a major acquisition. ","Adjusted diluted EPS excludes acquisition integration costs and any other special items that may occur during a given quarter. It also excludes the noncash impact of the amortization of intangibles and the noncash impact to interest expense of the assignment of fair value to debt outstanding from the application of business combination accounting rules to recent acquisitions. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.55 for the fourth quarter. Excluding a $30 million additional noncash employee benefit cost due to changes in the discount rate and actuarial assumptions, the adjusted diluted EPS was $0.58 for the quarter.","Total cash operating expenses increased 1% in fourth quarter 2011 compared to pro forma fourth quarter a year ago, with the synergy achievement and any other cost reductions offset by additional noncash employee benefit cost driven by the reduction of the discount rate and the actuarial assumptions and higher-than-anticipated network expenses and customer premise equipment cost that more than offset lower salaries and wages, marketing and advertising expenses. ","We generated solid operating cash flow of approximately $1.85 billion for the fourth quarter, especially if you consider that we incurred the approximately $60 million of higher-than-anticipated operating expenses during the quarter.  ","Additionally, we achieved free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid for taxes, interest and capital expenditures and additional adjustments to other income, of $515 million during the quarter. ","Our strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility we need to capitalize on opportunities and meet the challenges that arise and take advantage of opportunities that arise to drive long-term shareholder value.","Now turning to Slide 11. I'll begin the operating segment discussions today with our Regional Markets Group. Further, I want to remind you that we will be providing revised pro forma segment financials when we report first quarter 2012 results, reflecting the transfer of legacy Qwest data centers to the Savvis operating group, which we accomplished as of the first of the year. ","Regional Markets Group generated $2.24 billion in operating revenues, which represents a decrease of 3.9% over pro forma fourth quarter a year ago. Strategic revenues grew to $761 million in the quarter, up 5.8% pro forma year-over-year. Legacy services revenues for the segment declined $136 million or 8.6% from pro forma fourth quarter 2010. ","Our total segment expenses in RMG declined 2.7% to $991 million from pro forma fourth quarter 2010. Our expense reductions for the fourth quarter compared to previous year were mainly driven by synergy achievements, which were partially offset by costs related to the rollout of our Prism TV product in additional markets during the year.","Moving to Slide 12. Our Business Markets Group generated $947 million in operating revenues during the fourth quarter, which represented a decrease of 3.3% from pro forma fourth quarter 2010. Excluding the decline in data integration revenues, the total percentage decline for the quarter was only 1.2%. ","Fourth quarter strategic revenues increased by $12 million or 2.8% to $446 million from pro forma fourth quarter 2010, driven primarily by Ethernet and MPLS services.  Excluding low-speed private line, strategic revenue grew 7.8% from the year ago period. ","Legacy revenue for BMG declined from fourth quarter 2010 by $22 million, primarily due to ongoing migrations of customer acquisitions, applications from legacy, LAN and voice products to next-generation IP and Ethernet solutions. While data integration revenues decreased $22 million or 12.7% due to the unusually higher results for fourth quarter 2010. ","Our total segment expenses in BMG increased by 1.7% to $587 million from pro forma fourth quarter 2010 as we experienced higher expenses related to CPE and an increase in the number of sales professionals.","Moving to Slide 13. Our Wholesale Markets Group generated $955 million in operating revenues, a decrease of 4% from pro forma fourth quarter 2010 as access in long-distance revenues continue to decline, but were partially offset by wireless carrier bandwidth expansion during the quarter. ","Strategic revenues for WMG grew 5.4% to $564 million from fourth quarter 2010, primarily driven by continued strong data transport demand from wireless providers. Our legacy revenues declined by about 15% to $390 million.","Now turning to Slide 14, in our Savvis segment. Savvis generated $260 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 3.6% from pro forma fourth quarter revenues of $251 million. This growth comes primarily from year-over-year increases of 12% in managed hosting and cloud services revenues with total hosting year-over-year growth of 7% and a slight decline in network services. ","Savvis' operating expenses were $208 million in the fourth quarter compared to $193 million in pro forma fourth quarter 2010. This increase of 7.8% is driven by additional cost to support revenue growth across staffing, expansion of data centers, third-party services and sales and marketing.","As shown on Slide 15, we continue to meet our integration objectives and achieve all our synergy targets as we realize the benefits of the Embarq, Qwest and Savvis acquisitions. We completed the integration of Embarq during the fourth quarter and achieved our targeted annual run rate synergies of $375 million. ","With respect to Qwest, we ended 2011, having achieved an annual operating expense synergy run rate of approximately $235 million or about $35 million better than our expected year-end 2011 exit run rate, primarily due to achieving certain synergies earlier than anticipated. ","In total, we expect to achieve an annual operating expense synergy run rate of $575 million from the Qwest acquisition and anticipate reaching that synergy target over the next 2 to 4 years. During the fourth quarter, we successfully completed the conversion of the Qwest financial and HR systems as we had planned and previously discussed with you.","Slide 16 addresses our 2012 guidance. For first quarter 2012, CenturyLink projects total revenues of $4.58 billion to $4.64 billion and operating cash flow between $1.84 billion and $1.90 billion.  Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to be $0.57 to $0.63 per share. ","For full year 2012, CenturyLink expects operating revenues of $18.2 billion to $18.4 billion, representing an annual decline of 1.5% to 2.5% from 2011. ","Continued successful execution of our local operating model, further investment in broadband and IPTV video and key initiatives in the business markets and managed services areas will fuel further revenue improvement in 2012. We estimate operating cash flow of $7.4 billion to $7.6 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.25 to $2.45. We expect to generate free cash flow of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion. Capital expenditures are expected to be slightly below 2011 and range from $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion, excluding approximately $100 million of integration-related capital.","To elaborate on the expense portion of our full year 2012 guidance, we continue to take costs out of our business through synergies and other incremental expense cuts. At the same time, we're investing both capital and operating dollars in other growth areas of the business. While this causes our expense trends to not reflect the cost management that we've undertaken, we believe these investments are important to achieve our fundamental goal, which is profitable top line growth. ","Our 2012 EBITDA expectations reflect the combination of factors: Incremental synergy achievement of $250 million in 2012; ongoing cost management initiatives aimed at streamlining processes and rightsizing our support structure; continuing disciplined investments in strategic growth initiatives, including IPTV expansion, fiber-to-the-node and fiber-to-the-tower footprint expansion; business markets growth initiatives and hosting and managed services. We expect to exit the year with $450 million in run rate synergies from the Qwest acquisition on the path to deliver the full $575 million we have previously communicated.","That concludes our prepared remarks, so at this time, I'll ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mike McCormack from Nomura Securities.","Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just thinking about the EBITDA trend, Stewart, throughout the year, we saw margin pressure sort of building throughout the year. With the 2012 expectation, it looks like there's something to recover in Q1 and stayed pretty strong throughout the year. Just trying to get the puts and takes there. And I noticed also BMG margins took a pretty strong hit in the quarter. Just trying to figure out if that's a seasonal impact or whether we'd see continued margin pressures there?","R. Stewart Ewing","Mike, for BMG, the CPE was a portion of the margin hit that they took in the fourth quarter. And in terms of 2012, yes, we would anticipate -- we see some normal seasonal improvement in the first quarter. I mean there'll be some continued pressure during the year, but we hope to relieve some of that pressure with the continued synergy achievement that we expect during the year, as well as our business as usual expense cuts.","Operator","Our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","One question on the EBITDA, reported EBITDA for the fourth quarter. I think you missed your guidance a little bit. Can you go through the drivers for that? And if that number also has impacts on the noncash pension and OPEB cost? And how should we think about that pension cost? How much of that is included in the EBITDA guidance for 2012?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so Batya, the reason we missed the EBITDA guidance slightly in the fourth quarter was due to the additional expenses in the fourth quarter. Again, about $40 million of that related to pensions and benefits, $30 million of which was really noncash and is really included as a cash expense in EBITDA, the way we handle it. But that $30 million related to lowering of the discount rate and changing in some of the other actuarial assumptions related to primarily long-term disability. The other $10 million really related to the medical expenses being about $10 million over what we had expected for the quarter. So that was about $40 million. Additionally, we had some network expense, incremental network expense in the quarter of probably $25 million, $25 million to $30 million or so. Some of that was driven by the additions that we had with respect to high-speed Internet, our IPTV. That growth drove some incremental expenses, as well as completing the connections, the Ethernet connections to fiber-to-the-tower. So that really accounts for most of the other expense increases during the quarter.","Batya Levi - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And for 2012 guidance, how much do you think pension and OPEB is going to hit EBITDA?","R. Stewart Ewing","So we'll have about -- there's about $50 million or so. When you combine pension and OPEB, that hits expense as a cash expense in our EBITDA number.","Operator","Our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you walk us through sort of the trends of the Savvis business? It looks a little bit lower than we would have thought in the quarter. When did the bookings turn into sales and actually start hitting the books? And then what's the status with the Qwest data centers that were sort of underutilized? And at what point should we start to see that either be lumped into that Savvis business or start to see that start to grow?","Glen F. Post","Frank, this is Glen. I'll start, we'll then ask Jim Ousley here to really go into a little more detail. We had low bookings in the third quarter. Of course we knew we had some federal stuff coming in -- flowed into the fourth quarter there and we had some higher churn as well in the third quarter. All that caused the -- some delay in the revenues. With the larger deals that we're working on, there is a larger time frame required for it to complete those. But overall, we think we'll see that pick up in the first quarter and we're going to spend some revenue in the second quarter. And we're seeing in 90 days or so lag on the revenues. But Jim, do you?","James E. Ousley","Yes, this is Jim Ousley. Third quarter obviously was when the transaction took place, so we had a lull in bookings in the third quarter due to the transaction. Customers waiting to see if there was going to be an impact, what was going to transpire, employees of course are also, so third quarter bookings definitely affected the fourth quarter. The very positive aspect is once that was all done, we communicated with our customers. We had the strongest fourth quarter bookings we've had in several years. So that fourth quarter bookings will reflect in revenues, starting the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter. So we see the recovery out of the third quarter lull as very strong.","Frank G. Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe, Stewart, can you comment on use of cash? I'm seeing you're still working on some of the debt repayment commitments you've made and then thoughts on use of cash after that?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. So Frank, basically, we'll -- it'll take most of the year to really complete the $1.5 billion to $2 billion pay down of debt commitment that we made to the rating agencies and really, frankly, take most of the free cash flow that we have this year that won't be used for dividends. So yes, I would expect that towards the end of the year, as we see how we have performed in 2012 and have our outlook pulled together for 2013, we'll talk with the board about use of cash going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You had strong broadband results, and you talked a little bit about the local market. Is this something that you think there's an opportunity to continue into 2012? Perhaps if you could just talk around some of the things you're doing there and the results you're getting? Also, in terms of the capital spending budget, I think the capital spending is coming down a little bit in terms of intensity. Just talk about how much of this is related to things like IPTV and sort of growth initiatives, how much is sort of maintenance.","Karen A. Puckett","Simon, Karen Puckett. In terms of the broadband growth, we did have a good quarter. Key enablers, really the local market, holding the general manager accountable for specific and getting the local team involved. Secondly, our go-to-market continues to ramp the changes we've made. Marketing to noncustomers, more DM, the 5-year Price-Lock, as well as Bundle Your Way is playing very well for us. And then our channels and our call center channels we've improved pretty significantly ourselves per 100. The other benefit we're really ramping on some retention programs that we've been working through. So all of that is equated to this overall significant improvement in broadband, especially in the Qwest market.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And so something that is sustainable into '12?","Karen A. Puckett","We're optimistic about 2012. And typically, first quarter, we had such a strong fourth quarter, first quarter likely will not. We're putting some plans in place to make sure of quality of customer, less peers, so that would have an impact in terms of inwards. But in terms of quality, double play kind of customers, we'll continue to focus there and see what happens here in the first quarter.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And on CapEx?","R. Stewart Ewing","On CapEx, Simon, first of all, about 25% of our capital budget is what we would consider just maintenance. If you look at other, a few other big buckets that are really associated with our growth drivers, basically, with respect to the Savvis and the hosting business, we'll spend between $330 million and $350 million in 2012. Our fiber-to-the-tower initiative, somewhat dependent there on finalization of plans by the folks that we're building the towers for or building the fiber-to-the-tower for. But expect to spend $250 million to $275 million there. High-speed Internet related, which would include our fiber-to-the-node continuation, which is a project that Qwest has had ongoing for several years, we expect to pass about an additional 1 million homes in 2012 with fiber-to-the-node. We'll spend $290 million to $320 million there. That includes extra -- additional capacity as well and modems for the fiber-to-the-node financial side customers, things like that. In our Prism and video, we'll spend, some of this is success based, but somewhere between $80 million to $120 million. So that's about $950 million to $1.05 billion, or so for the capital budget this year. And again, another 25% or so is maintenance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.","Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Three questions, if you don't mind. What kind of speeds can you get on the fiber-to-the-node improvements or potential, anyway, in a couple of years? And how many homes do you think you can really economically build out to over time? And then secondly, now that you've really gone through a lot more, you're done with Embarq and looking at Qwest, are there any real differences in integration between Qwest and Embarq? And then lastly, why aren't you counting, maybe the pension hit as a little bit onetime in nature here?","Glen F. Post","Okay. First, Tim, regarding the fiber-to-the-node, we normally expect to get 20 to 40 megabits buildout. With that expected bonding, we can take that to 40 to 80 megabits. That's the range we're looking at on fiber-to-the-node. And as far as how many homes you can economically build over time? We're still working through that with technologies changing and improving all the time. We're about, I think, about 37% of our homes now built to the fiber-to-the-node, plus we have other direct, other loop shortening efforts and we have -- now we're getting 10 to 15 megabits in a lot of other areas without fiber-to-the-node, using just our loops. Even up to 25 megabits in a lot of our -- in all of our base level, of our Prism TV areas, which are not Qwest really not fiber-to-the-node. This are fiber builds and shortening, loop-shortening capabilities. So although we feel good about where our network is right now. We've got a lot of work in the network, and it's really a high-quality network in most of the cities we're in.","R. Stewart Ewing","And Tim, just in terms of differences in integration of Qwest and Embarq. Really, the Embarq systems are more complicated than the Qwest -- I'm sorry, Qwest systems are more complicated than the Embarq systems were. Just if you take, for example, the conversion of the financial and HR systems, there were many, many more systems that surrounded the financial and HR systems that were feeding the Qwest financial systems that we had to provide interfaces for and things like that associated with the conversion to the ERP systems that we use. So it was a much more complex conversion than the Embarq conversion. If you look at the billing and customer-care conversions, there too, you'll have more complexities associated with Qwest than we do with Embarq. With respect to the employee benefit cost in the quarter, first of all, I guess there were not pension costs, which others, I guess, had called out as changes in the discount rate, impacting in their fourth quarter. This was really for us related to our long-term disability plans, and it was the result of the discount rate decline, as well as some other actuarial costs associated with medical insurance. But basically, we have that adjustment at the end of each year. It's just that it was higher in the fourth quarter this year than it typically is due to the decline in the discount rate primarily.","Operator","Our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wondered if you can delve into 2 numbers a little bit. First, on the business market side, the direct expenses have been ramping for the last few quarters. Can you talk about sort of what's driving that? You've talked about sort of adding to sales there in the past, but help us out there.","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes, so that's it. Basically, you see some fluctuation from quarter-to-quarter with respect to CPE expense. That fluctuates kind of based on the CPE revenue that we see quarter-to-quarter. But the other driver of expense increases in BMG had really been the sales people that we've added over the past 3 quarters or so. So we ramped up the sales force to try to basically get to revenue stability hopefully on BMG, and it has resulted in improved sales bookings quarter-to-quarter. Over the last 3 quarters, we've seen higher bookings than Qwest had previously seen in the few quarters prior to the acquisition.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And does that feel more sales-driven? Or is it an improvement in the overall business?","R. Stewart Ewing","It's more sales-driven. We've really not seeing any difference, that we can tell at least, associated with the economy at this point.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then on the wholesale markets revenue, the strategic revenue declined this quarter. I would think that with all the towers coming online that would continue to increase. What should we be thinking about there?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. We had a couple of one-time adjustments in the fourth quarter that impacted the strategic revenue on wholesale. But again, it's just a  one-time adjustment that we had there. Basically it's a settlement or accrual for settlement with a carrier, more or less.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So without that, it would have continued its upward trajectory?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. Without that, we would have had continued increase. We're very pleased with the fiber-to-the-towers that we installed during 2011 and especially in the fourth quarter and expect that to -- as well as copper circuits, as the wireless carriers continue to order the towers where we don't have fiber. So we expect to continue that trend of upward revenue hopefully on the strategic side in the wholesale business.","Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. As long as we're on wholesale, maybe you can help us on the legacy side. Down 17% in 2011 versus '10, how should we think about that trending in '12?","R. Stewart Ewing","Yes. Basically that's minutes of use-driven. Our minutes of use, were down probably a little over 15% in 2011. And what you'll see in 2012 is, with the implementation of the plan that the FCC has put in place, we'll see the Switched Access revenues over the course of the next few years decline significantly, pretty much go away. But the good news there is that we're hopeful that we'll get some relief on -- get some additional Universal Service Fund revenues associated with the broadband plan that they have in place, as well as, we got some flexibility to make some rate adjustments with our customers as part of that as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen from Macquarie.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","I'm wondering when you think about the trade-off between higher operating expenses and getting to revenue stability sooner, how do you evaluate that trade-off going forward? And if you had the opportunity to go out and spend another $200 million or $300 million in 2012 to get maybe another 20 or 30 basis points of year-over-year growth exiting the year, is that a trade-off that you'd make? And at what point do you say, we've invested enough and we're drawing the line in the sand in OCF and free cash flow?","Glen F. Post","Kevin, a couple of things or points, I'd make, Stewart may want to follow-up. First of all, the legacy revenue losses, those are high-margin revenues, and we're going to expect to see that mix change. So they were just talking about with the minutes of use issues we have. That's going to be reduced. At the same time, we think we have really, strong opportunity to grow -- for growth in our major strategic initiative areas with our continued broadband expansion, with our fiber-to-the-node, with our Prism TV efforts and our fiber-to-the-tower. That's going to help stabilize our revenues and grow revenues over time. And then finally, the managed hosting cloud services, we think there's outstanding growth potential. Bringing all those together, we believe that we're on a good track to, where we can -- with the reduction in revenue losses this year, that we should see an evolution toward revenue stability and eventual revenue growth. So we feel good about what we're doing for specific opportunity, every one, it just depends.","Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research","And where do you expect to end the year in terms of year-over-year revenue declines exiting Q4 of 2012?","R. Stewart Ewing","Not really ready. We'd rather see the year develop a little bit, but I mean we're comfortable in the 1.5% to 2% range for the full year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tom Seitz from Jefferies.","Thomas O. Seitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","The cable companies are increasingly talking about Wi-Fi hotspots. For now it's an add-on for their higher-tier broadband customers. I know you've done one-off Wi-Fi projects in the past. But is that something that you're looking at as a retention tool or potential opportunity down the line in connection with your broadband offerings?","Glen F. Post","Yes. It is and we're looking at it. Of course, we do have a number of hotspots across the country today. We're looking also for an opportunity to -- for offload opportunities for wireless carriers, even our Wi-Fi. So that's another area we're looking that we think could drive more traffic and then be a revenue generator. So yes, it is an area we continue to look at, Tom.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathy [ph] From UBS.","Unknown Analyst","Just 2 quick questions. First, hoping you can give us kind of your current thoughts on potential M&A over the next 18 months or so. And then second, related to that, I'm wondering if you can also give us your thoughts on some comments AT&T made about divesting access lines, what your appetite might be for access lines.","Glen F. Post","As far as M&A potential, we're focused today on our 4 primary growth areas that I just talked about. And we have also -- second, we're focused on integration of Savvis and Qwest, and we have to get that right. And so we're not -- we don't feel a need to go out and acquire right now. Doesn't say we wouldn't look at opportunities that came along that drove long-term shareholder value, but that's not our focus today. As far as AT&T, we won't comment on AT&T lines. We don't know what their plans are. We've heard those rumors for many years, a number of years now and we won't comment on that. But we don't think we need to just go out and buy access lines for additional scale. So if there's an opportunity there that drives shareholder value, we consider it. But it's not a real big appetite from our view today.","Operator","I'd like to hand the conference back over for any closing remarks to Mr. Glen Post.","Glen F. Post","Thank you. Turning to Slide 19, we are pleased with where the company exited 2011, and we feel well positioned to achieve our goals in 2012. Since 2011, we generated pro forma revenues of $18.7 billion, a 3.8% decline from pro forma 2010. Our revenue continues to shift toward faster-growing strategic services, now representing nearly 45% of our total revenue. And we expect that decline to be reduced, in revenues, to be reduced to 1.5% to 2.5% in 2012. ","Also, after several years of hard work from our dedicated employees, we have successfully completed the Embarq integration, and now we look ahead to completing the integrations of Qwest and Savvis, and we feel we've made solid progress in both of those fronts so far. ","Our local operating model continues to prove effective and show long-term benefits to our operating trends, as illustrated by the improved access line losses, the higher broadband subscriber growth and increased Prism TV customers we saw during the past 2 quarters. ","With our broadband suite of products -- product suite and the  strong asset mix, we are gaining momentum across selling products throughout the business segments. We feel we'll see that continue to grow. ","And overall, we're pleased with the quarter results and are optimistic about our business. ","So thank you for being on our call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in the months ahead.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes our program for today. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"5076":["CenturyLink, Inc.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, August 8, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Valerie Finberg, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Valerie.","Valerie Finberg - Chief of Staff, Office of the COO & Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations","Thank you, France. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink second quarter 2018 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sunit Patel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Unless otherwise noted, prior periods are provided on a pro forma basis, assuming both the sale of the legacy CenturyLink data centers and colocation business and the acquisition of Level 3 occurred as of January 1, 2017.","Unless otherwise noted, revenue and sales comparisons to prior periods are provided on a year-over-year basis.

The presentation also includes the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Valerie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today.","I'm excited about the potential we see in the business to continue to grow free cash flow per share. We believe this is the most important value driver in our business, and we had a good quarter on that front.","A few thoughts to highlight, integration is going well, and we are ahead of plan for capturing synergies. We believe our global network assets, robust product portfolio, and our willingness to invest to meet our customers' needs enable CenturyLink to evolve as our customers evolve.","In addition to the integration efforts associated with the acquisition of Level 3, we are also focused on transforming to more efficient operating models beyond the capture of synergies. Integration is about bringing the two companies together. Transformation is about enhancing our business for effectiveness, cost efficiency, and customer experience to move us to where we want to be as a company.","We are working to create a more digital experience across our customer base from our Consumer customers to our largest Business customers. I'll talk more about these transformation efforts a little later, but we're excited about what it can mean for our employees, our customers, and our shareholders.","As a result of the progress we've made in the first half of 2018, we announced that we are increasing our outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the full year 2018. On the call today, Sunit will provide an update on our detailed financial results and our updated full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on integration, transformation, and the company in general. After that, we will open it up for your questions. Sunit?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff, and good evening, everyone. I'll start on slide 4 with some highlights from the second quarter. We continued to execute well on capturing synergies this quarter, achieving approximately $675 million of annualized run-rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the Level 3 transaction, compared to $215 million as of the end of the first quarter 2018.","We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.27 billion. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 38.5% from 35.7% in the second quarter 2017 on a pro forma basis. We generated free cash flow of $919 million, and we raised our outlook for full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA to $9 billion to $9.15 billion from $8.75 billion to $8.95 billion, and free cash flow to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion from $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion.","Turning to slide 5. Total revenue in the second quarter declined 2.3% to $5.9 billion, with declines of 1.2% in Business revenue and 5.9% in Consumer revenue. As we mentioned on last quarter's call, on January 1, 2018, the company prospectively adopted a new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606. Adjusting to exclude the revenue recognition standard, total revenue declined 2.1%, Business revenue declined 1.6%, and Consumer revenue declined 4.0%.","For the second quarter, the revenue recognition standard negatively affected total revenue by approximately $11 million, with a $27 million negative effect on Consumer revenue. Business revenue saw a $16 million positive effect. Within Business, there was a benefit of approximately $14 million to the Medium and Small Business unit and approximately $4 million to the International and Global Accounts business unit. The Enterprise and the Wholesale and Indirect business units were affected minimally.","Within Business, our Medium and Small Business revenue decreased 1.0%. Excluding the effects of the revenue recognition standard, Medium and Small Business revenue declined 2.6%, as we managed through declines in our legacy voice services. We are seeing improved productivity from our sales teams and better success selling into a larger on-net building footprint.","Revenue from our Enterprise group was flat compared to the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, with our focus on profitable revenue, we terminated an unprofitable government contract in this business unit.","International and Global Accounts or GAM revenue decreased 0.9%. Within the group, Global Accounts revenue increased 0.2%, and international revenue declined 1.8%. Excluding the effects of the revenue recognition standard, international and GAM revenue declined 1.3%. The decrease in revenue we saw this quarter was also driven by our efforts to drive more profitable revenue. We recently renegotiated a large contract with a European Global Accounts customer that reduced revenue but will improve EBITDA performance. That reduction will also impact our revenue performance slightly in the third quarter.","I would like to note that 70% of international and GAM revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Overall, 95% of total company revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and so fluctuations in foreign currencies have little effect on total company revenue, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow.","Wholesale and indirect revenue decreased 2.7%. Within the group, wholesale revenue decreased 4.5% and indirect revenue increased 9.5%. In the second quarter, we did have a favorable dispute settlement with a carrier.","From a sales standpoint, we continue to build on the momentum we saw at the end of the first quarter, as total sales production improved on a sequential basis. Consumer revenue declined 5.9% in the second quarter 2018. Excluding the effects of the revenue recognition standard, Consumer revenue declined 4.0%. We saw similar revenue performance in the first quarter 2018.","Within Consumer, we saw a net loss of about 80,000 broadband subscribers this quarter. This quarter's total was made up of losses of about 134,000 at speeds under 20-meg, and gains of approximately 54,000 in the higher speed offerings. Within the gains at the higher speeds, 22,000 were at speeds of 100-meg or higher.","Overall, we are focusing our efforts on ramping up our Price for Life offering, which is driving higher ARPU and improved customer experience metrics for customers who moved on to that plan. In addition, we are planning on increasing our investment in targeted areas where we can profitably offer much higher broadband speeds.","Moving to revenue results by product group on slide 6, Transport and Infrastructure declined 1.9%. IP and Data Services increased 2.1%. Voice and Collaboration Services declined 8%. IT and Managed Services increased 5.2%.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on slide 7, for the second quarter 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $2.271 billion compared to $2.155 billion from the year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin grew 38.5% for the second quarter 2018 compared to 35.7% in the year-ago quarter. We generally expect adjusted EBITDA margins to expand in the future.","For the second quarter of 2018, capital expenditures were $755 million. In the second half of the year, we expect high investment for the CAF or Connect America Fund, success-based capital, and capital to drive network expense synergy and operational improvements in the business. We continue to expect to spend approximately 16% of total revenue on capital expenditures for the full year 2018.","In the second quarter, the company generated free cash flow of $919 million. Free cash flow includes the benefit of a $314 million tax refund related to our 2017 taxes that we mentioned last quarter.","During the second quarter, the company made a $100 million contribution to the pension plan. As a result of accelerated adoption of certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we received an additional income tax refund in the third quarter of $392 million related to our 2016 taxes. Using the proceeds from this tax refund, along with a small amount of excess cash, we made an additional $400 million pension plan contribution in the third quarter. Our pension plan is now over 90% funded. In addition to improving the funded status of the pension plan, these contributions provide us with tax benefits and reduce the annual Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or PBGC premiums that the pension plan has to make in the future.","We exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.2 times. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4 times, which will primarily be driven by growth in adjusted EBITDA.","Moving to synergies on slide 8, as of the end of the second quarter, we have achieved a total of approximately $675 million of annualized run-rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the Level 3 transaction closed. We continue to expect to achieve our targeted $850 million run-rate adjusted EBITDA operating expense savings.","Integration-related expenses incurred in the second quarter of 2018 totaled approximately $162 million, of which $160 million impacted adjusted EBITDA and $108 million impacted free cash flow. These expenses were higher as we picked up the pace of integration. Notable increases were in severance as well as impairment of office and technical space that we are exiting.","Turning now to slide 9, with our strong synergy attainment in the first half of 2018 along with our continued focus on profitable revenue growth, we are increasing our outlook for full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. We now expect full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.15 billion compared to our previous outlook of $8.75 billion to $8.95 billion. In addition, we increased free cash flow to $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion from $3.15 million to $3.35 billion. The company also updated full year 2018 outlook measures for free cash flow after dividends and full-year effective tax rate.","I'll summarize by saying we remain confident in our financial performance for the remainder of the year. Our strong delivery on synergy targets directly translates to solid adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow growth this year.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Sunit.","I'll start with an update on integration. I won't go into the initiatives I've discussed in previous calls, but I'll share a few integration highlights from the last quarter to give you some examples of the ongoing progress we're making.","One of the key steps for a successful integration is rationalizing and standardizing your products. Today, we have a detailed rationalization road map across our company's extensive product portfolio, and are actively working to implement that road map.","We've already launched the in-state version of several of our most important products. By combining the best of both companies' portfolios, we will end up with better products that neither of the previous companies would have had on their own, and our responsiveness to the market will be enhanced.","And in areas such as Cloud, SD-WAN and Security, the more robust capabilities of the combined product portfolio enable us to compete for a broader set of opportunities. We've implemented a single standardized master contract for new sales, eliminating unnecessary time in the process. This has been well-received by our customers and our sales team.","If you've never negotiated a sales contract for technology services, this may seem like a small point, but it's an example of our efforts to streamline processes, cut cost, and improve the customer experience across the company. We've implemented new automated service activation capabilities within our on-net building footprint to significantly reduce installation intervals so we can sell and quickly install services for small- to mid-sized businesses in those buildings, including in certain locations customers self-provisioning.","Lastly, we continue to make progress moving customers from off-net to on-net. This progress takes a long time, but helps us win new sales, expands our network access margins, and drives a much better customer experience. As I said earlier, integration is about bringing companies together. The transformation is about creating what we want the new company to be. We are continually evaluating how we change the experience of our customers and our employees.","Previously, I've discussed our consumer Price for Life initiative. That effort has been highly successful, with around 40% of our broadband based on that pricing program. The better news is we've improved the customer experience. These Price for Life customers no longer have to worry about bills changing or promotional pricing rolling off. They're happier. It's simpler. And they call less about billing issues, which lowers our costs and streamlines our operations. We continually work to improve the customer experience across our business since higher customer satisfaction drives better sales and reduces churn.","Our product decisions also feed into the transformation efforts. For example, our products assist business customers in their own transformation by better managing a hybrid multi-cloud environment. Our products are designed to streamline activation and reconfiguration and make it easier for customers to manage the ongoing transition to the Cloud, giving customers better control of their cloud environment. We have a long way to go, but transforming CenturyLink will position us well to compete in the market, improve adjusted EBITDA, and drive free cash flow per share.","As I noted at the beginning of the call and as I've said many times before, I firmly believe that growing free cash flow per share is a key driver to increasing shareholder value. At CenturyLink, we deliver that cash flow growth by driving a great customer experience, growing profitable revenue, and investing our capital to drive growth and to reduce the cost to operate our business.","I've spoken about profitable revenue for a long time. We do not focus, however, on empty calorie revenue; that is, contracts or services with very low or no margin. As a result, you will see us continually evaluating our existing business and moving away from unprofitable revenue. Consistent with this approach, last quarter we noted we were discontinuing our linear and over-the-top consumer video products. This quarter, Sunit mentioned a couple of larger contracts we are exiting given the profitability profile of that business. Clearly, those affect the top line of our business. But our focus is to align our time, our capital and our resources to our more highly profitable opportunities.","While a large part of our adjusted EBITDA growth story this year is a result of synergy attainment, focusing on profitable, higher margin revenue is another lever to effectively align our sales team, improve adjusted EBITDA, and grow free cash flow.","As I mentioned earlier, the capabilities of our product portfolio are opening opportunities for us. More than either CenturyLink or Level 3 standalone, the combined CenturyLink is a participant in virtually every large deal in the U.S. wireline enterprise market and a serious provider globally. These deals often have a longer sales cycle, but our overall opportunity is growing. We also expect to grow our share of wallet with these customers that both companies serve prior to the acquisition. We find that customers want a single provider to manage their complex communications needs, and appreciate how focused we are on their business.","For example, General Mills, the American multinational manufacturer and marketer of branded foods sold to retail stores with brands such as Cheerios, Wheaties, Betty Crocker, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs to name a few, was historically a customer of both CenturyLink and Level 3, though neither company had the primary provider status.","In June, as a combined company, we won the primary provider status via a competitive RFP for General Mills' 120 site global MPLS network, displacing the long-time incumbent carrier. Our combined global assets, dedicated focus, and strong customer support model were key factors in the selection. We'll have to see with this particular customer but, in general, being the MPLS core within Enterprise, will also position us well to provide their backbone needs such as waves and fiber solutions, their SD-WAN needs and other capabilities. We find that customers want an integrated network solution, and we have a product portfolio able to meet those needs.","In general, our approach to the business is to focus on selling where we have great network assets, invest to expand our already extensive fiber and IT footprints, simplify and automate to enable and enhance customer experience, and augment our services where we think we have a sustainable competitive advantage. SD-WAN is an example of augmenting our services.","Our existing network with millions of customer circuit, a global fiber footprint, and an extraordinary IP backbone already delivers connections to the world's most important cloud, data center and software-as-a-service providers. The expansion of new services like SD-WAN and embedded security enables us to create competitive advantages in Enterprise networking with the scale and scope few others can match.","We believe the CenturyLink of today is very different than the CenturyLink of the past. We are not a small rural local exchange carrier. We are not even a large local exchange carrier. We are a global technology company, solving our customers' ever increasing need for scalable bandwidth and easy to operate communications infrastructures. We provide a bandwidth platform necessary to fuel our customers' growth and leverage their own digital transformations.","Before we open the call up for questions, I want to take a moment to discuss our Consumer business. Adjusting for revenue recognition, you can see from our results that overall revenue declines have been moderating. Part of that is due to the success we've seen from our Price for Life program, which has helped to increase ARPU, reduce churn and improve the customer experience. More generally, we are assessing where we believe we can generate good returns for the company, looking at micro targeting initiatives, how we go to market and how we redefine the customer experience. Maxine Moreau and her Consumer team are doing an excellent job.","Given the higher satisfaction and low return we see with higher speeds, we look to extend our fiber footprint in areas where it makes sense. We have the benefit of being able to spread our fiber investments across our entire customer set, from Consumers to our Global Accounts. We also have the benefit of spreading our fiber investments to take advantage of things like the coming IoT revolution and the evolution of technologies like 5G small cells.","In rural areas, we will continue investing through programs like CAF II and investigating how we can use a hybrid fiber wireless network to deliver services. Across all of our investments, we will remain disciplined in how we approach the opportunities, with a focus on enhancing the employee and customer experience, and expanding our footprint and delivering innovative products to the market.","In summary, we're pleased with integration of Level 3. We're focused on driving profitable growth, continuing to capture synergies, and taking advantage of the cost and customer experience transformation opportunities we see. We will continue investing in the business to drive future growth and free cash flow per share.","With that, operator will you explain the process for asking a question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Absolutely, Jeff. Our first question will be from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Mr. Horan, please go ahead with your question. Your line is open, sir.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Sorry about that, guys. It was on mute. Great quarter. Congratulations. When you talk about exiting the unprofitable business, are you seeing any pricing power? Can you raise prices on some of the businesses where you've been losing money in the past? And can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on your overall product portfolio, how it's kind of comparing to your competitors at this point? Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","With respect to the product portfolio, first, we think we have a very effective product portfolio. We have \u2013 our customers have networking challenges. They want to connect to a variety of different locations with a variety of \u2013 for a variety of different needs. And whether it's Dark Fiber between two closely located data centers or waves between two remotely located data centers or MPLS in their core or SD-WAN on the edge or providing connected security to tie all that together, managed services, we think our product portfolio is very comprehensive and actually meets the needs of our customers. We focus less on what our competitors are doing and more what are the needs of our customers.","With respect to pricing, we've never really complained about pricing one way or the other. It is what it is in the market, and we focus on making sure we're meeting our customers' needs and being competitive there. We are happy with the pricing environment, as you can see the margin expansion.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess first on the synergy side of the equation, obviously pacing well ahead of at least our expectations, and pretty nice step up from 1Q. When you guys announced the deal last year, I think the target was about 80% of that $850 million within the first three years. You're pretty much at that target now. So I'm trying to figure out, is there an upside to that $850 million target, or are we due for a slowdown in terms of the incremental pacing from here?","And then secondly, maybe just on the broadband side, if you could, just remind us what percentage of that base is sitting at less than 20 megabits per second. And, Jeff or Sunit, maybe, how you're approaching that portion of the base a little bit differently maybe going forward to try and retain more of those beyond just Price for Life? Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. I'll take a stab. So on synergies, yes, we are running \u2013 as I said, we picked up the pace a lot. We still expect to be at $850 million. However, as Jeff said, as we sit back and look at all the benefits you can get from a digital future in terms of how we interface with our customers, we continue to think there will be cost transformation opportunities for us over the next years that we are doing the planning for and aim to take full advantage of over the next few years. So I think we're still at the $850 million, but we're obviously getting there quite a bit faster, as you pointed out, given that we are already at $675 million with two full quarters.","And then your question on the broadband subscribers, generally, as we look at our broadband subscribers in the 20-meg, we have roughly about 40% in the 20-meg and then 60%, a little more than \u2013 or the other way around, I'm sorry, 60% in the less than 20-meg and 40% in the more than 20-meg. That's the mix.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And as we think about those customers, we're going to continue to invest where it makes sense for us to do that. And so we're looking at multi-dwelling units and high-density areas and places where we have an advantage to build out fiber infrastructure, aerial areas, and we'll continue to look at that. We also have to do a good job though in selling once we've activated those areas. We have a fairly significant portion of our network that is enabled at 100-meg or higher, and we need to do a good job of selling that. But we will continue to invest in it. We will invest in it smartly where we think we can get good returns on it.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think I pointed out in my comments that I think we're doing a lot of planning now to actually take up the investment in Consumer that we've had a good chance to know, as Jeff pointed, to use the word micro-targeting in remote areas. It makes sense for us to put money. So I think you'll see the pace of investment in the Consumer side pick up and certainly on the CAF side.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Okay, thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Mike McCormack with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Sunit, let me just have a quick clarification on the CapEx intensity. It looks like that's remaining steady, but the overall CapEx guide has come down by $150 million. I'm just trying to get a reconciliation around that.","And then as far as the Enterprise trends go, I know you mentioned a particular customer maybe being disconnected. But what are you seeing? Potentially if you can, give us trends that you're seeing legacy Level 3 versus legacy CenturyLink, just overall growth rates and what you're seeing in the marketplace. Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","So the CapEx intensity I think has been the same. We've been at 16% of revenues and it's still at the same place. Obviously, we are running lighter than that in the first half of the year, which is why I said that in the second half of the year, our capital spending will be higher as we spend more money on the Consumer side with CAF and other initiatives. We'll spend more money turning up with the sales orders we receive with success-based capital. We'll be spending more CapEx to turn up more buildings on-net, to drive net ex synergies. We'll be spending more money for things like systems integration, other capital expenditure investments that will drive reductions in operating expenses. So the guide has been at 16% from the beginning, Mike.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right. And just a clarification, does that change then to your expectation on the top line reflective of that?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","No, I think the guide has always been as a percent of revenue. That's been consistent with our past practices. It's one way of saying that whether revenues move up or down, a big portion of the capital spending is success-based based on how we are doing on the revenue side. So it remains at 16%.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it, okay.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","We don't have any revenue guidance per se. And as I mentioned, we saw our sales pick up over the course of the first quarter. And as I also said, the sales production in the second quarter was higher than what we saw in the first quarter, which is the other reason why I said we'd be spending more capital for success-based capital in the second half of the year.","And then on the Enterprise trends, I think in general, we see our ability to gain market share on the Enterprise side as being very good. In the short term, as Jeff pointed out and as I mentioned, we are combing through what parts of the base of the revenue is not profitable and how to address that. Having said that, we are seeing notable wins. As Jeff pointed out, as standalone companies, we weren't getting a chance at. So when we look at our sales funnel volumes and when we look at our sales production, we are pretty happy about what's happening there, and that should drive better performance over time.","But in the short term, whether it's unprofitable business, obviously you asked a question about legacy CenturyLink, legacy Level 3. Legacy CenturyLink had more legacy revenues if you like. So we're also dealing with that. You'll see more of that, for example in the Small and Medium-Sized Business segment. But in general, we're very excited about the combined company's network and our ability to gain market share. And we're already seeing it in the nature of the wins, as Jeff pointed to one particular example.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And we do like the mix of our product portfolio and think it fits well in the market with where our customers are going. Hybrid IT and hybrid networking are real things that are coming. The more we make our network flexible, controllable, and visible to our customers, the better off we are. And so we think we have a pretty good position there.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you, guys.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe on the back of the last question around revenues. I think, Sunit, you had talked about momentum in the sales funnel exiting 1Q. You're talking about increased productivity, but revenues were actually down sequentially. So, how do we think about the trajectory from here? Do we anticipate more pressure as you maybe weed out some less profitable contracts, or is there an opportunity to see some of this momentum begin translating into more stability and potential growth from here? Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thanks. So I think from an overall perspective, we continue to see our business revenue performance improve over time. As I said, there are some short-term things that I mentioned specifically on profitable revenue, some legacy revenues. But overall \u2013 and there is a lag between us \u2013 sales production and the revenue usually showing up a quarter later. But \u2013 and also remember, we pointed to, in the fourth quarter, as we were closing the transaction we saw some sales weakness in the first quarter as the companies came together. We started up slow. But as the momentum in the sales production is picking up, you will start seeing it translating into our revenue transfer on the business side. So, we do firmly believe that we're going to see that happening over time.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And if I can just follow-up with one other question. When you think about investing and upping the investments in the Consumer business, can you help us just think about where the increased spend is going? Is it primarily CAF, or is it more in urban footprints where there may be a little bit of an opportunity to beef up speed? I'm just trying to get a sense of how we should think about where this increased spend is going to go. Thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, as I said in my remarks, I think it will be for CAF, it will be in urban areas, as Jeff pointed out, where it makes sense. He mentioned specific examples like MDUs, condominiums, apartment complexes or areas where businesses and residences co-exist. It could be an area \u2013 in suburban areas with good socioeconomic demographics where we can extend our fiber network from the central office to a neighborhood.","It could be things like new neighborhoods opening up where we, as a local phone company, we typically go there with high broadband speeds to start with. When you do that, the neighbors \u2013 the neighborhood surrounding those new areas, makes sense to offer high broadband speeds very profitably.","So, we have different \u2013 numerous examples we can give you where we see that. So, as I said, I mean, when I compared the first half of the year to the second half of the year, we do see an increase in capital spending happening in these areas. We're focused on planning and identifying the right places, but then our deployment speed should pick up there.","And that's also generally true not just with the Consumer side, but also on the Business side, as I say. More sales production, driving more success-based capital, more buildings on-net to drive net ex, we'll see spending pick up in that area in the second half of the year compared to the first half. And similarly, more CapEx spend to drive further OpEx reductions like in systems integration combining platforms and some of the customer experience initiatives that Jeff talked about.","Matthew Niknam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. First, regarding the low calorie revenue that you called out, can you give us any sense for how much revenue of that is in the base? And is it safe to assume that it's primarily in the legacy CenturyLink's out of the house?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","So, I think the only reason we pointed this out in this quarter is because there were specific contracts that were large. I think, in general, there is no particular contract that amounts to anything of size that we are worried about. Most of the business generally is profitable. I think if you look at the EBITDA margins we talked about, the business overall is pretty profitable. It's just that it \u2013 this \u2013 the particular ones we highlighted was for two reasons; one, to underline the discipline of pursuing profitable business; and two, because it changed the trend a little bit because of these specific situations. That's the only reason we highlight it. But overall, in general, the base is fairly profitable.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And on these calls, Nick, sometime we talk about legacy this or legacy that. But internally, we don't think about any of these as legacy Level 3 or legacy CenturyLink. It's all CenturyLink going forward. And so we don't really focus on how we break those things out.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, that's helpful. And second, obviously with the last big integration you had, TW Telecom, you also pulled in synergies at a much faster rate than originally expected. Are there a lot of internal issues down the road? Can you help us get comfortable with the idea that \u2013 and the speed of which you're executing on this front isn't going to lead to any hiccups at a later point?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, I don't think that the pace at which we captured synergies led the churn on TW Telecom. I think our focus led the churn on TW Telecom. When we acquired them, they had a large \u2013 small customer base that wasn't something that Level 3 particularly focused on, and so we took a large effort to move up market. And as a result, we took our eye off some of those smaller customers a little more than we should have. In this integration, we have Vernon Irvin and an entire team in what's called GEMS that is our small and medium business customer group that are focused on driving that penetration and the success with those customers.","And we have a multi-pronged approach, everything from direct sales people that hit the street and go talk in multiple tenant buildings or people on call centers that do outbound call, inbound calls. We have a very strong focus in Vernon's team on that low end of the customer base. And I think CenturyLink, contradicting my last statement, the legacy CenturyLink has an expertise there that the legacy Level 3 didn't have.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","The size of the business is a critical mass comparable to the size of the business that the cable guys have. Same number of zeros behind it. So, it's a business that we're very excited about because, to Jeff's point, we weren't really sell to that customer base in the legacy Level 3 on that building, so now we are much bigger on that building footprint as a combined company so we see quite a bit of opportunity there over time.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, Nick, I don't think \u2013 or excuse me, David, I don't think we did as good a job as we could have, but it wasn't because of the pace. Sorry, Nick. Yeah.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","No worries, no worries. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of David Barden from Bank of America. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the questions. So, I got a handful just related to the guide to kind of clarify it all. So, Sunit, the question on the implied revenue guide. You have a lower CapEx number. People are dividing it by 16% and are coming up with a lower revenue number. Wondering if you are lowering revenue guidance by implication. So, the question is, do you have a different revenue expectation this quarter for 2018 than you did last quarter? The second question is \u2013 go ahead, go ahead.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","No. Go ahead, go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","So, the question was on EBITDA guide. If you could kind of unpack that, how much of the increase is synergies? How much of any of the increase is the actual underlying business? And how much is related to this one-off item that you called out in the quarter? And then, the last question...","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","There's a lot of item in the quarter. I'm sorry I didn't catch that.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","You called out that you had a one-time item in the quarter. I think it was in the Enterprise Business...","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. The settlement, yeah.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Yeah.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And then the third one was just, extending that analysis down to the free cash flow line, the change in free cash flow there is going to be \u2013 again be synergies plus core business. But then there was also that other kind of one-off element of tax refunds and working capital changes. And if any expectations on that has changed. That'll be helpful. Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","All right. So, a lot of questions. I'll try to get \u2013 if I missed anything...","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","I'll remind you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","So, look, \u2013 no, I think, David, we provided capital expenditure guidance for years at Level 3, and 16% is the guide we provided. It's not meant to implicitly or explicitly refer to anything with respect to revenue. We don't provide revenue guidance. You can back-calculate anything you want. I think the main point is, we're investing pretty significantly. It's 16% of revenue. That guide does not include integration expenses, and it's just that simple. You can think anything else, if you wanted, of it, but this is consistent with longstanding past practice we have. It's 16% of revenue. We feel good about that, and I think that's what we are looking to. It has no tangential bearing to revenue, anything like that.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And we're highlighting that we're a little bit below that right now. Bu that's come from some good things that we've found, capital synergies and other things that we think we can do a better job, better management of the capital expenditures. But in the second half of the year, we think it's going to increase, and that the full guidance for 16% is still the full guidance.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","On the EBITDA stuff from the one-time settlement, it's not meaningful. We now generate \u2013 if we take this quarter, the $2.2 billion of EBITDA, first of all, in any given quarter, there are fair number of offsetting items.","The only reason I mentioned that is that within that particular segment, it helped the results slightly. Within the overall results, it's a nothing. There are so many things happening. It's minimal. It's not even worth talking about, which is why I didn't put in an amount. So it's not really meaningful.","And then similarly, on the free cash flow, the first tax refund, we already talked about previously. So there was no surprise there. The second tax refund, we took all of that and added some extra money and contribute another $400 million. So that's a wash. So there's nothing \u2013 meaning that whole \u2013 the additional tax refund that we hadn't talked about got all contributed to the pension plan.","So net-net, we've increased the cash flow guide pretty significantly driven by the EBITDA increase, and the incremental tax refund went straight to contributing to the pension plan. So it's actually a fundamental increase in the guide. There is not much happening in other places that's driving that...","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. And just...","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","...with that increase.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","And just one follow-up, Sunit, is just as you think about that guidance increase in EBITDA, is it all about synergies? Is it mostly about synergies and a little bit about the business? Can you give us some color as to what's...","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, so...","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","...the moving part there?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think the big news there is synergy driven essentially, because the revenues are declining slightly, so we see margin losses from that every quarter, which has been the case over the last few quarters and will be the case over the next few quarters. But it's primarily driven by synergies.","David Barden - Bank of America - Merrill Lynch","Great. Okay, guys. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Philip Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","Hi, guys. A couple of follow-ups. First, in Consumer, is there a point at which you can tell us what your overall CapEx sort of strategy is? Or is this a bit of a constant work in process?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think the overall strategy is to get more \u2013 to spend capital where we can profitably, whether it's to help drive higher broadband speeds. And in general, that's what we are doing. The key is targeting where we have those opportunities, and, two, making sure we're actually delivering on the penetration that we think is reasonable. And really that's the essence of the strategy. And Jeff has a couple things.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","It's not a very clever strategy. It's, let's spend money where we can get a return on our investment, and there are different places that make sense. We'll continue to look at how do we get more network for the same dollars. Can we get capital efficiencies and synergies out of designing better networks, can we focus on areas with aerial plant versus underground plant, can we focus on areas that are closer to the central office than further than the central office? So it's certainly a work in progress, but the answer is driven by the same things. Can we make money, is it a smart decision for how we invest in providing those services.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And that, when combined with the Price for Life offering, has fundamental implications for our cost structure internally just by radically simplifying how we reach out to customers. They don't need bills every month. They're not going to be talking about billing errors. Those things have a lot of costs internally.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And we are looking \u2013 I mentioned it in my earlier comments \u2013 that we are definitely looking at how do we transform our business. And in particular, for our Consumer customers, how do we transform the digital experience that they have. There are a bunch of them. A little bit of savings from each of them adds up. And so we look at that just because of the volume of activity and say this is an important thing for us to continue to focus on. We look across the company, how do we improve their digital experience with us, but the Consumer business is part of that, and we'll continue to invest capital to simplify that business for the customers.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And on that front, to give you a sense of the momentum for it, if you go back to over a year ago, we had no Price for Life, and now 40% of our consumer base has Price for Life. That is pretty radical and transformational. And those are the fundamental implications...","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","Okay.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","...for the cost of us supporting that business.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","But we shouldn't look for any sort of \u2013 we're going to have x-million fiber and y-million wireless homes at some point. This is more of a gradual figuring it out as you go what makes sense and which area type of plan.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","But it's certainly helped powered by things like big data, machine learning, algorithms, artificial intelligence, marrying up the network footprint in the households and addressable market correlations, where enterprises exist, where we have wireless load opportunities. So it's a lot more richer than what you might have thought about 20 years ago, we were trying to walk neighborhood by neighborhood trying to figure that out.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","Thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","(49:23).","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","And on the Consumer side \u2013 I'm sorry, excuse me \u2013 on the Enterprise side, the industry overall was fairly weak on business telecom spending. And we haven't seen any improvement with tax reform or the economy heating up. You said you're happy with pricing. What do you see in the market overall compared to a year ago?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think the tax benefit is obviously very powerful. You can see how it's helped us at the company for example in terms of pension contributions and other things. But I do believe that \u2013 we believe that as you see things like 5G, Internet of Things, machine-to-machine-driven bandwidth demand increases for people consuming more entertainment on mobile, as all of these things are happening in Enterprise, we have to serve those needs. We are definitely well-positioned with the depth and capillarity of our networks to ride that with hybrid network, all the things we have talked about, SD-WAN.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","If you move upstream from the taxes, upstream to the demand generators for our products and services, we don't see any change in any of that. Bandwidth is increasing. It's going to accelerate the increase over the coming years. It's not going to decelerate. It's not going to hold flat. It's going to continue to accelerate.","The number of locations that traffic is coming from, whether they're enterprise locations or IoT devices within those enterprises, the number of locations that traffic is coming from is going to continue to increase. The complexity that CIOs are dealing with is going to continue to increase as they look at hybrid IT and hybrid cloud, multi-cloud environments, how are they going to manage all their loads across all these clouds, the need for flexible bandwidth for flexibility and control and visibility into that bandwidth is going to increase. The need to secure it with embedded or connected security is going to increase.","So as you look upstream from the tax code, all of the drivers of our business are continuing to be drivers. Now, will over time the tax benefits encourage people to spend more? We hope so, but they're going to spend regardless in continuing to upgrade their capabilities to match the changing environment and their changing needs.","Philip A. Cusick - JP Morgan","Good. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for taking the questions. Just dove-tailing on the prior question, how do you see the shifting competitive landscape at the moment? Clearly, if we think about your portfolio of assets and where you're strategically investing money at this point, have you seen a material change in terms of the competitive landscape and your ability to garner additional wins and things along that nature?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I've said this for so long, a lot of you are probably tired of hearing about it. But I believe our ability to win is based on our execution, not our competitors, not any other things, but we just have to execute better. So no, I don't really see a difference that much in the competitive landscape. From one quarter to the next, some competitor may emphasize one thing more than they did the previous quarter or emphasize one channel more than they did the previous quarter, but our ability to win is based on our ability to execute.","We have to have the right products over the right network, targeting the right customers with the right value proposition. And as Sunit said, we saw sales pick up first quarter to fourth quarter and second quarter to first quarter. So we think that the products and services and capabilities are resonating well. Now we have to continue to install, and we have to continue to do a great job at service assurance and reliability, but it's up to us, I think.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And then to add to what Jeff said, we are the second largest provider of wireline telecom services to enterprise. It is 76% of our business. If you look at all the other competitors, the two telephone companies is at most a side business. Wireless is their main business. And the other two guys, their main business is providing broadband and media services. And again, the Enterprise business is a side business. So among the five big competitors, we are the only one where it is our business serving enterprises.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. And then just touching upon the commentary you made about the sales funnel improving and the conversion to revenue, do you have a good sense at this juncture when we should start to see that sales funnel more accurately reflected in the revenue trajectory or when you potentially could see a return to growth on the top line? Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","So I think we generally don't provide revenue guidance. Having said that, I do believe that you will continue to see us over time drive better and better revenue performance and drive that Enterprise business to growth. We haven't outlined any specific timeline. But I think as you look at us on a year-over-year basis, you will see that with our focus and our execution, as Jeff pointed out, we will start delivering on better underlying revenue trends and drive that Enterprise business to growth.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Our next question will be from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you. Good evening. Jeff, it was helpful getting the color on the transformation initiatives. How should we think about the opportunity there both in terms of the dollars or the cost savings and also the timeframe to achieve? Is the opportunity here comparable to the deal synergies? Is that a good way to think about the size of it? And then on the synergies achieved to date, how much of that is network synergies you've talked about that taking a longer time? So, is there still lot of those to go or have you already recognized quite a few of those?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. I'll answer the first one, then let Sunit answer the second one. I'm not going to size what the synergies are \u2013 or the cost savings are that come from transformation. I'll tell you the benefits of it, and I'll talk about the timeline a little bit. Now, the first thing that we did as a result of transforming our business is a simplified employee experience. They can do a better job for our customers if we simplify their environments. It's not about bringing the two companies together. It's about changing the work that they do and making it easier for them to do it.","If we do that, then we drive a better customer experience. And we drive a better \u2013 we drive costs out and we drive a better customer experience along with the better employee experience. When we drive better customer experience, we see this time and time again across every business unit, if we drive a good customer experience, we reduce churn and we sell more. And those things are the primary benefits of it.","Now this is not a short-term thing. Is it transformational? I mean, I wouldn't use that word if I didn't think it was big and impactful and really change our business. It's not little step around the edges. We have to transform our business, be very aggressive about it, but it does take a long time. But it's also one of those things that we have to do concurrently. It's not we're going to wait till we're done with synergies and integration and then we're going to start on transformation, we have to define what we want to be right now, and we have to start moving toward that right now. And without kind of \u2013 really kind of bounding the scope of it, we do think that it creates a very good path forward for us as we look out at our business over the next four and five years.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. So to add to that, which I agree with, I think that we said in prior quarters, Simon, that combined with synergies and other opportunities, we see the opportunity to take \u2013 expand our EBITDA margin 500 to 700 basis points, so 5% to 7% from the starting point or roughly about 35%, 36%. As you saw with this quarter, we are in the 38-plus percent range, so certainly plenty of margin expansion opportunity ahead, with synergies and cost transformation. So hopefully that helps. And we say it'll take us several years to do that, but we continue to feel very comfortable and confident about it without bounding it per se.","And then your question on net ex synergies, so for the \u2013 since closing in November 1, predominantly, most of the synergies have been on the operating expense side, not on the network expense side, and most of the mix between the operating expenses has been on the head count side followed by non-head count-type synergies, whether it's real estate exits or cutting duplicate fees to vendors, systems integration, that sort of thing.","However, that is not atypical of what we see in a big combination. So what that means is as we look at the second half of the year and next year, we'll see more cost savings coming out of the network expense side, and those opportunities will exist for the next several years. So, we do see network expense picking up in subsequent periods in terms of synergies.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question will be from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for squeezing me in, and just coming back to the residential side, you talked about how it can make sense to tick up investment where you think you can get returns. Does that imply that your overall level of capital intensity could move higher over some period of time? I know you've given guidance for this year, but maybe just thinking bigger picture, where do you think you can meet those investment objectives within sort of your standard CapEx budget? And then you mentioned some wireless opportunities. I'm curious, there is going to be a few opportunities to maybe acquire spectrum over the coming quarters. Do you have any interest in using your balance sheet to buy spectrum licenses? Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","So I'll speak for Jeff, but, no, we don't expect us to be buying any spectrum. I'll let Jeff explain what he meant by that. We won't be participating in any of those. So, no, we don't expect the capital intensity to go higher. As I said, we're already running a little light first half of the year, and we expect that to ramp up second half of the year both in Consumer, dealing with additional sales order volumes, and driving more on that footprint and investment to enable more digital platforms.","So, no, all of that, I think, fits within the 16% we talked about. Also remember that we squeeze \u2013 squeezing out a fair bit in CapEx synergies, so that also helps us. So, I think that's all contained in what we said. So over time, we don't expect the capital intensity to change. However, if we see more profitable opportunities or higher levels of sales production at good returns, we won't hesitate to spend more. But from based on what we see today, we think that's really appropriate. It's a pretty healthy level of investment both in absolute and in comparison to other carriers. So, Brett, I think we're quite comfortable with that.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. And, Brett, on the hybrid fiber-wireless side stuff, I mean, you're seeing that we are working in the rural markets to look at different technologies to build broadband services to rural customers more efficiently and effectively under a CAF program. We'll continue to do that.","If you look at unlicensed spectrum in the rural, it's not as much of a problem as unlicensed spectrum in an urban market. And so there are different things that we're looking at. I don't see us going out and being a major buyer of spectrum in wireless, but we're open to how do we best serve our customers and what things make sense.","In the densities of an urban market, direct fiber is not a bad thing, and so we'll continue to look at all of those. We'll look at how we're going to serve the 5G carriers and how do we lay that fiber in such a way that we benefit our consumers, our small and medium business, our large business customers, our federal government customers, our state government customers. We get the benefit of looking across that whole customer set and saying we're going to invest in the infrastructure to support all of them. And so we'll continue to do those things, but I don't see us going out and buying \u2013 being a major player in some spectrum auction.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. I think that's the last question, so I'd like to close the call with a recap of a few thoughts. We are focused on profitable revenue growth and believe we have a strong market position. We're confident in our ability to effectively integrate Level 3 and capture the synergies we've previously announced.","In parallel, we're investing in transforming our company to continually enhance the customer experience, simplify the operating environment, improve our effectiveness, improve our cost efficiency. We have a disciplined approach to managing the business and are looking at many opportunities across the company. And as you can see from our raising our guidance, all of these efforts are part of our objective to grow adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow per share.","Thank you for joining today's call and for your support of CenturyLink.

Please go ahead, ma'am.","Valerie Finberg - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Melody. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink third quarter 2018 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Neel Dev, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Unless otherwise noted, prior periods are provided on a pro forma basis, assuming both the sales of the legacy CenturyLink data centers and co-location business and the acquisition of Level 3 occurred as of January 1, 2017.","Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, free cash flow and net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA discussed on the call today exclude integration-related expense and other items as noted in our earnings materials.","All of our supplemental earnings materials, including the presentation we will review on the call, can be found in the Investor Relations section of the CenturyLink's website at ir.centurylink.com.

Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Valerie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today.","A week ago today marked the one-year anniversary of CenturyLink's acquisition of Level 3. To date, we're pleased with our integration progress. On our third quarter's earnings call last year, which was just a few days after the acquisition closed, I told you that the combined company is focused on a few things; profitable revenue growth, operational excellence to reduce costs and drive a great customer experience, and increasing free cash flow per share. We made good strides on all of these objectives over the last year.","You can certainly see the benefits of our initiatives to reduce costs and increase free cash flow per share in our strong synergy achievement, margin expansion and continued growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. I believe these results demonstrate the value of the acquisition. We are very focused on operating the business with discipline and efficiency, and you'll continue to see us focus on expanding margins and growing the bottom line.","Additionally, with our focus on profitable revenue, we've taken a hard look at the business and stopped certain product lines, exited unprofitable contracts and changed our approach to how we sell things like CPE. While these decisions negatively affect revenue, they're the right decisions for the business to drive growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow.","We've made a great deal of integration progress this year, combining networks and systems, improving how we interface with our customers and making it easier for our employees to do their jobs. While we still have more integration work to do over the next year or two, our focus shifts more and more to transformation.","On today's call, we'll follow our usual process. Neel Dev will provide an update on our detailed financial results and our updated full year outlook. I'll then provide an update on our integration and transformation progress and the company in general. After that, we'll open it up for your questions.","Before I turn the call over to Neel, I wanted to take just a moment to introduce him to those of you who have not met him. Neel has been with the combined company for 14 years, having joined Level 3 in 2004. While he was part of Sunit's team since that time when I joined Level 3 in 2008 as the COO, Neel was also part of my team as our operational finance lead. I've worked closely with him since 2008 and have frequently given him large roles such as in the Global Crossing and tw telecom acquisitions.","I also asked Neel to lead the integration planning team for Level 3 during the acquisition by CenturyLink. After the close in his role with finance, he has been instrumental in driving our synergy achievement and other integration initiatives. I have very high confidence in his abilities, his focus on results, and I am very pleased to have him as the CFO of CenturyLink.","With that, I'll turn it over to Neel.","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Jeff. I really appreciate those kind words and I'm excited to take on the CFO role for CenturyLink.","Good afternoon, everyone. I will start on slide 4 with some highlights for the third quarter.","We achieved approximately $790 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the close of the Level 3 transaction. This compares to $675 million reported in the previous quarter. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $2.287 billion. On a pro forma basis, we expanded year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin to 39.3% from 35.5% from the year-ago quarter.","We generated free cash flow of $1.163 billion and we are reiterating our outlook for full year 2018 adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.15 billion, lowering our outlook for capital expenditures from 16% of total revenue to a range of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion. And as a result, we are updating our outlook for free cash flow to $4 billion to $4.2 billion from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion.","Turning to slide 5, total revenue in the third quarter declined 3.6% to $5.82 billion, with declines of 3.2% in Business revenue and 4.6% in Consumer revenue. As we have mentioned each quarter this year, the company prospectively adopted the new revenue recognition standard, ASC 606, on January 1, 2018.","Adjusting to exclude the effects of the revenue recognition standard, total revenue declined 3.8%, Business revenue declined 3.3%, and Consumer revenue declined 5.4%. I'll note that the remainder of my prepared remarks will discuss results excluding the effects of the revenue recognition standard, except where noted.","As Jeff mentioned earlier, we have refined our philosophy and financial guardrails around CPE sales to focus on opportunities with recurring networks services revenues. This is yet another example of our ongoing effort to focus on profitable revenue. To put this in perspective, Business markets revenue results were impacted by a year-over-year decline in CPE revenue of approximately $30 million.","Moving to our Business units, our Medium and Small Business revenue decreased 4.4% year-over-year. Part of the decline was driven by CPE and a recently renegotiated large contract with a state and local government customer that reduced revenue, but extended the contract life by seven years. We expect to see the full impact of the renegotiation in the fourth quarter. This was a good outcome for legacy voice services.","Sequentially, the decline was 1.5%, with compares to sequential declines of 1.9% in the first quarter 2018 and 2.5% in the fourth quarter 2017. We had a strong second quarter this year with sequential growth of 1.5%, which was primarily driven by several non-recurring revenue items.","Revenue from our Enterprise group declined 2.3%. Year-over-year performance was impacted by the full quarter effect of the low-margin government contract we referenced last quarter and lower CPE revenue compared to the year-ago quarter. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1.2% compared with 2.6% last quarter.","International and Global Accounts, or IGAM, revenue decreased 3.4%. The decrease in revenue we saw this quarter was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the unprofitable large contract with a European customer we renegotiated in the second quarter. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1.3% compared to 4% last quarter. This quarter was also impacted by currency weakness in Latin America.","Wholesale and indirect revenue decreased 3.5%. A sequential decline of 2.1% compared to growth of 1.7% in second quarter, driven by the carrier dispute settlement we mentioned last quarter.","In summary, on a sequential basis, business markets declined 1.5% compared to 0.8% in the second quarter of 2018. The higher sequential decline was primarily driven by our actions on CPE, FX headwinds, and the full quarter effect of the unprofitable contracts we mentioned last quarter. Excluding these items, the sequential decline was comparable to the second quarter.","Moving now to Consumer, third quarter 2018 Consumer revenue declined 5.4%. Given we stopped marketing Prism in the first quarter of this year, declines in Prism revenue accelerated this quarter, but were in line with our expectations, as were declines in voice revenue.","Within Consumer, we saw a net loss of about 63,000 broadband subs this quarter. This quarter's total was made up of losses of about 130,000 at speeds under 20-meg and gains of approximately 67,000 in the higher speed offerings. Within gains at the higher speeds, 27,000 were at speeds of 100-meg or higher. The Price for Life offering now represents about 50% of our Consumer broadband customer base.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on slide 7, for the third quarter of 2018, adjusted EBITDA was $2.287 billion compared to $2.140 billion from the year-ago quarter. We continued to expand adjusted EBITDA margins during the quarter, which grew to 39.3% compared to 35.5% in the year-ago quarter.","From the third quarter 2018, capital expenditures were $665 million. Year to date, capital expenditures represent approximately 13% of total revenue, running behind our full-year expectation. We realized and exceeded our expected capital synergies shortly after close, and are therefore seeing the full-year run rate benefit this year.","In addition, we put in place a capital governance process comprised of senior leaders of the company to ensure all investments are in line with business and financial objectives. The financial rigor and discipline led to several decisions to redirect investments. One example is our decision to minimize investment in our copper-based plant for the Consumer business. However, we are ramping up investments in our fiber footprint for Consumer to complement our micro-targeting strategy. These changes in capital investment strategy led to some air pockets in spending, as some projects ramp down and others ramp up.","Next, our supply chain and network planning teams have done an excellent job in recovering and redeploying equipment and capacity, leading to capital spending avoidance and a significant non-recurring benefit for 2018. Cash spending is ramping up, but lower than our original expectations for the year. Again, the delays were driven by engineering and design iterations to reduce cost.","In summary, we have several initiatives around improving the efficiency of our capital planning, allocation, approval, and deployment process. This gives us much higher confidence around our investments going forward and has resulted in both recurring and non-recurring benefits in 2018. Longer term, we expect to invest around 16% of total revenues to drive profitable revenue growth and plan to be more specific about 2019 on our fourth quarter call.","In the third quarter 2018, the company generated free cash flow of $1.163 billion. During the early part of the third quarter and as we indicated on the second quarter earnings call, we received an income tax refund of $392 million related to our 2016 taxes. Using the proceeds from this tax refund along with a small amount of excess cash, we made a $400 million pension plan contribution. Year-to-date, we have made $500 million of voluntary contributions to our pension plan.","During the quarter, we successfully completed the redemption of four notes at Qwest Corp. that aggregated to $1.3 billion. We funded this redemption using cash on hand and approximately $600 million from our revolver. We exited the quarter with our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at 4.1 times. We remain focused on getting to the low end of our target leverage range of 3 to 4 times.","Moving to synergies on slide 8, as of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved a total of approximately $790 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies since the Level 3 transaction closed. We expect to achieve our targeted 850 million run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies before the end of the year. We are at the point in the integration process where we are beginning to transition from integration synergies to digital and cost transformation.","As such, while we are not updating our synergy outlook, we do expect significant cost transformation savings in 2019. We plan to say more about that on the fourth quarter call. Integration-related expenses and special items incurred in the third quarter 2018 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $59 million and payments of integration-related expenses and special items impacted free cash flow by $60 million.","Turning now to slide 9, as a reminder, we raised our full year 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow during last quarter's call. With our continued focus on profitability, we remain confident in our performance for the rest of the year and are reiterating our full year 2018 outlook for adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.15 billion.","As I mentioned earlier, our initiatives around improving our capital planning and deployment processes have resulted in lighter capital expenditures. With that in mind, we now expect full year 2018 capital expenditures of $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion, which is lower than the original outlook of 16% of total revenues.","Primarily driven by lower capital spending, we are updating our full year 2018 outlook for free cash flow to $4 billion to $4.2 billion from $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. I'd also like to point out that based on our free cash flow outlook, our dividend payout ratio as a percent of free cash flow is expected to be in the mid-50s this year.","Keep in mind, in 2018, we had approximately $300 million of aggregate one-time cash flow benefit from the tax refunds, net of higher pension contribution we made this year, and the bonuses paid to Level 3 employees in 2017 versus 2018.","Excluding the benefit that I mentioned, and if our capital expenditures were around 16% of total revenue, our payout ratio would have been in the low 70s. We are pleased with the improvement in our payout ratio compared to last year and remain comfortable with the dividend.","I'll summarize by emphasizing Jeff's earlier comments. Having just passed the one year mark, we feel good about our synergy achievement, margin expansion and focus on profitable growth. On a personal note, Jeff and I've been working together for more than 10 years now and I'm looking forward to continuing our partnership in moving CenturyLink forward. We look to finish the year with a continued strong focus on execution as we transition from integration to business transformation.","With that, I'll hand the call back to Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Neel.","I thought I'd start with giving a few highlights with integration progress over the last year and starting with a few examples of initiatives we completed this quarter. For North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific, we've completed our enterprise resource planning, or ERP, and are now on a single instance of the system for all ERP functions. Latin America is scheduled for conversion some time mid next year.","We've made progress in combining wholesale-oriented billing systems related to inner-carrier compensation and have moved the Level 3 business to the go-forward systems. Also contributing to our synergy attainment, we've continued consolidating real estate this quarter.","As a reminder, over the course of the last year, we've made great strides in a number of areas, sales force integration, network interconnection, contract integration, migrating circuits from off-net providers to our on-net facilities and integration here can be very challenging.","Employees transition to new roles, systems change, account reps are assigned new customers and our customers' interfaces to the company change as well. We seen these changes \u2013 challenges in many of the acquisitions we've completed before and I'm pleased to say that even in an acquisition as large as Level 3 we've managed the transition well.","Neel and our integration teams did an excellent job during the integration planning process and since then in the execution of those plans. A few key metrics that we watch that demonstrate success are number one, legacy revenue churn has been in line with expectations. Customer retention has been strong, which can always be an issue in an integration year.","And although the fourth quarter is typically the lightest sales of the year since the fourth quarter of 2017, we've now had three straight quarters of sequential Enterprise sales growth. While pleased with that growth, especially during an integration year, given our assets and our capabilities, we're not satisfied and we believe it should be stronger.","Neel discussed our revenue in detail and I won't go through it again, but I want to emphasize, we are focused on profitable revenue growth that drives margin expansion and EBITDA growth. We'll continue to be very disciplined in this respect.","While we do have additional integration work to complete, our focus is now turning to transformation. As I noted last quarter, integration is about bringing the two companies together. We've done well on this front. Transformation is about enhancing our business for effectiveness, cost efficiency and customer experience, to move us where we want to be as a company. And I'm excited about the opportunity to fulfill our vision for the future.","Not only will our transformation initiatives improve how we interface with our customers, simplify the employee experience and enhance the capabilities we deliver to the market, we also have a significant opportunity to remove costs from the business.","One important aspect of transformation is our product evolution. Our goal is to offer products that drive our customers' own capabilities forward, allow them to use our products to complete their digital transformations and enable their growth. We want to offer products in a way that customers want to buy and consume them in an increasingly digital and dynamic way.","We certainly made progress in simplifying our products, but have also focused on launching new capabilities. In October, we introduced Dynamic Connections as part of our Cloud Connect portfolio. Dynamic Connections leverage CenturyLink's software-defined networking technology to give customers the ability to establish new Ethernet connections to cloud service providers across the globe and within minutes.","We'll continue expanding the depth and breadth of our platform to many cloud service and software-as-a-service providers, but today if a CenturyLink customer in North America, EMEA, or Asia-Pacific wanted to reach AWS, for example, they could configure their bandwidth in any way they like.","Enterprise customers will be able to securely connect their private data centers and office locations directly to the cloud whenever they want and only pay for the time that they keep the connections in service.","Once the initial capacity is established, they can manage their network capacity just like they do their cloud capacity, seamlessly shifting loads from one place to another.","During our last earning call, I said CenturyLink is not a telecom company, but that we are a technology company. Making it easier for our customers to utilize technology on a global platform is key to their success and ours.","In September, we announced the global expansion of our SD-WAN solutions. With this expansion, our SD-WAN capabilities are available in more than 30 countries throughout North America, EMEA, Latin America and Asia Pacific, connecting to more than 2,200 owned and third-party data centers and over 100,000 enterprise buildings worldwide.","This launch also enables a single global hybrid networking solution that pairs SD-WAN with any combination of CenturyLink's leading network solutions, whether VPN for private networking, dedicated Internet access, broadband and wireless solutions for public networking, as well as customer-provided networks. This solution is built in our go-forward ecosystem, providing an improved experience for CenturyLink customers and employees.","Also, in September, we launched Vyvx Cloud Connect, which gives broadcasters the ability to easily move live and linear video from studios and stadium venues into and out of the AWS cloud. This allows broadcasters to take advantage of the media workflows that help them make video ready for over-the-top delivery. With these capabilities, along with our large existing product portfolio, position CenturyLink to win in the market by helping our customers solve their diverse communications and networking needs.","As an example of a recent win, a customer at both Level 3 and CenturyLink recognized our combined capabilities and new product offerings and how the new CenturyLink is positioned to help them meet their evolving needs. After years of growth in a complex, highly regulated area, the customer is in the midst of a multiyear business transformation initiative. As part of their goals around operational optimization and digital transformation, they needed better solutions to operate their distributed environment. They needed a hybrid networking solution.","By partnering with CenturyLink, the customer will receive a mix of our MPLS, broadband, SD-WAN, and managed enterprise services at several hundred locations. Our turnkey approach, comprehensive product set, and the ability to proactively manage all aspects of the network migration were key factors in our selection.","Another area in our product evolution is our approach to 5G. We are working with our customers to enable their 5G roadmaps as we extend our fiber footprint. For a company like CenturyLink, with deep Metro assets and a desire to build to even more buildings and locations, 5G is certainly part of our network expansion strategy.","As we deploy fiber closer to both our Enterprise and Consumer customers, connecting 5G networks is a natural extension of our plans and represents a revenue growth opportunity. We also expect to partner with wholesale providers to use their 5G access technology where it makes sense as a part of our enterprise customers' overall networking needs.","CenturyLink's transformation, though, is not just about products and services. It's also about our day-to-day interactions with our customers, whether it's how customers purchase our products, the installation process, billing and payment, how they interact with us when they have an issue, or any of the other touch points along the way. All these interactions, whether a Consumer customer or a large Enterprise customer, are big factors in how the customer views their overall experience with CenturyLink. We must continue to evolve and digitalize their experience.","Because of the large number of consumer customers, we're working here first. We've initiated a human-centered design approach to really understand what's important to the customers and how we can deliver what's important in a seamless, automated interaction.","Transformation also means ensuring we have the right organizational structure in place. Technology, innovation, and IT are critical for our success. Since closing, we've achieved a number of important systems and technology milestones that have not progressed at the pace I believe we can achieve.","As I looked forward, I felt the need for greater clarity, visibility, and accountability across our technology and IT functions. To that end, I made changes in the leadership of the CTO team. Andrew Dugan is our new CTO, reporting directly to me, responsible for our network and technology platforms as well as our security team.","Fletcher Keister, who currently reports to me as the head of Strategic Operations and Planning, has assumed responsibility for leading our IT and transformation functions. And Shaun Andrews, who currently reports to me as the head of our Product team, is now responsible for our product development efforts as well. Each of these functions previously reported to Aamir Hussain, who's leaving the company as part of this reorganization.","I'll summarize the quarter by saying a year after the acquisition of Level 3, we've made great progress with the integration and are ahead of our planned synergy realization. With many transformation initiatives underway, we're excited about the opportunity to grow market share while also taking significant costs out of the business.","With that, Melody, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please proceed.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you. Jeff, can you dig more into the state and local government customer, what the impact of that was, and what the underlying Business run rate was? The Business lines all seemed to be particularly weak this quarter. Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, sure. I'll let Neel give the details, but it was a \u2013 we do a lot of business with state and local governments. And a lot of these deals are for voice services, legacy-type services. So this one in particular was a legacy voice contract. We look at that business and say how can we extend it, how can we take the contract and extend its life. And in this case, we gave them a re-rate, but extended the life of the contract by about seven years. Neel, if you want to add?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, Phil, I think for this quarter, it was in the mid-single-digit impact. And if you look at it quarter over quarter, it's going to be a high single-digit impact next quarter when you see the full quarter effect.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","So high single-digit impact on the entire line?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sorry. What was your question?","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm not sure I understand. High single-digit dollars impact, is that what we're talking about?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, high single-digit dollars impact only for the medium and small customer group.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And if we pulled that out, what would the rest of the business have done on a run rate basis?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","So I think on that Business group, if you look at the second quarter, it was an especially strong quarter. Sequentially we grew 1.5%, and that was primarily driven by Pro Services and some back-bills in the state and local government area. This quarter it was down 1.5% compared to 1.9% in first quarter of 2018 and fourth quarter of 2017. So generally, that's been kind of the trend for that group.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike McCormack with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open, please proceed.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks. Jeff, I guess just thinking about the investment in copper versus fiber. I mean that seems like a pretty obvious one and I know you inherited a lot of that business. But as you think about that network going forward and the losses in broadband, and obviously, more slanted towards the lower-speed customers, would there be any interests in investing faster? It seems like cable is going full speed ahead to get to gigabit speeds. Just thinking about the balance as far as you're seeing it. Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yes, absolutely. Mike, you're right, we want to invest. We know that where we invest in getting high speeds, we do very well. If you look at our net adds, those are in all high-speed areas. And so we are very heavily trying to invest. It's part of my commentary around 5G. It's part of my commentary around adding buildings. I think we have something like 7,000 to 8,000 buildings that we've already approved to build into. And so we're going to continue to push fiber closer and closer to our Consumer customers, closer and closer to our Enterprise customers, because we know that when we can get to a high speed, we can create a very competitive product.","We're also pulling back on some of the bonding and vectoring to get a lower-speed product. We know that at 20-meg and below, we're going to have trouble retaining the business. And so where it makes sense, we will invest where we invest, we expect to grow and we think that will be more and more fiber-based as opposed to copper-based.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","As far as the customer base, Jeff, what percentage of the subscribers are above or below the 20-meg mark?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","About 60% are below 20-megs and 40% and above 20-megs. So above the 20-megs, those subs are growing and the ones below 20-megs are declining.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And that's why we're using micro-targeting to figure out where to build and how to build and really working hard to drive the penetration and the footprint that we already have because we don't think we're fully penetrated in the high-speed footprint that we have.","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Two questions. One, CapEx is coming down about $500 million, but you're increasing free cash flow by $400 million. Can you help us with the delta? And then secondly, on the Enterprise side, can you size the unprofitable government contract that impacted in the quarter? Excluding that, how does the Enterprise trends look like? And do you still find more unprofitable revenue mixes in that segment that you think that will continue to impact Enterprise?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Neel, go ahead.","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. So on the delta between the CapEx and the free cash flow, Batya, what we did was also refined some of our working capital assumptions, so that's kind of the delta. So if you just think about AR alone, one day of AR for us is $65 million. So it's just a refinement of the assumptions there.","In terms of Enterprise, there's a few things that impacted the quarter. And so I would kind of bucket them as sequentially CPE, the unprofitable contracts, one in government, one was a Global Accounts customer and then we also had FX impacts in our IGAM group, primarily from Latin American currency. If you lump all of those together, it was call it roughly about a $30 million impact sequentially.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And, Batya, when it comes to getting too granular in all of this stuff, we try to avoid getting too granular and looking at individual contracts or anything when we're doing earnings calls. But we're going to continue to be disciplined about things that aren't creating value for us. If it's a low-margin CPE and then we're having to implement it and do other things and not generating a good return, it's distracting our organization and it's not giving us anything, so we'll stop it. Same thing is true for low-margin contracts.","We don't see a huge list of low-margin contracts out there, but there have been some and they tend to be kind of big ones when we find them. But there are also lower margin products and things that are not in our strategy going forward, things around maybe IT consulting services and some of those other types of products that are not network-centric. If they're not network-centric, we're going to focus on the network-centric things.","So we look at our business very diligently and continue to try and make sure that we're just doing smart things.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, you mentioned that CAF II is ramping, up so I wanted to dig into that a bit more. How much have you invested this year? How much CapEx do you think remains to complete the program? And how many homes do you have left?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","So I think on CAF-II, we're targeting getting to about 700,000 homes or so by end of this year and the overall program is about 1.1 million, 1.2 million homes or so. I'm not sure what the inception to-date spending is. This year we probably spent somewhere in the mid-200s and we're ramping up in the fourth quarter.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. And to complete it, do you know what the CapEx would be roughly?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Well, one of the things we're doing is looking at different technology solutions going forward. So that numbers, we're trying to bring it down a significant amount with potentially fixed wireless and other option. So that is still in flux in terms of what we think is going to be required to finish up.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Got it. And then, Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you noted that Enterprise bookings have been growing throughout the year but you kind of caveated at the end that you can do better. Were you suggesting bookings were below expectations or just that you could do better? And I guess in a more general sense, what sort of steps you're taking to get them where you think they can be?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. So, look, I am pleased that we've grown bookings every \u2013 or sales every quarter since the fourth quarter. But, Nick, my team knows that I'm perpetually dissatisfied and I think we can always do better. And we're making sure that we're simplifying our product set. We're creating a uniform footprint in every building so that when our sales people go out, they know what products are available. They can have standard products there. We're simplifying the operating environment for our sales team, and trying to make that better for them, simplifying the operating environment for our installation team so we can turn revenue up quickly. We don't have any particular problems associated with integration for installs, but I think we can always do better there, too.","And so, our goal is to get better every single day in every single aspect of what we can do. I look at our product set, I look at the market need, and I look at our capabilities and geographic footprint and I think we can do better. And so that's what my comments were about that, yeah, we're pleased with the fact that we've grown every quarter, but we're never satisfied with that. And we spend a lot of time internally looking and talking to our team, whether it's the product team or the sales team. How do we penetrate the market better? How do we win more business? What infrastructure do we need to be building in? It's part of the reason we have 7,000 \u2013 8,000 buildings in our queue because we think those are great buildings to convert off-net circuits to on-net, but they're also great buildings to add new customers in.","Nicholas Ralph Del Deo - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay, got it. Thanks, Neel. Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Horan with Oppenheimer & Company. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. Jeff, can you characterize competitive intensity out there? And it seems like a lot of companies are missing Enterprise revenue growth. Maybe is it \u2013 just your thoughts on why do you think that's occurring in the industry and what might turn that around?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I can't comment on anybody but ours, and ours has to do with some of the decisions that we've been making about what we want to do, what products we want to sell, what products we don't want to sell, what customers we want to serve, what customers we \u2013 contracts we don't want to continue with. I think that we can do a better job of executing, again, just looking at CenturyLink, not talking about anybody else. If we do a better job of executing and continue to drive our product portfolio, where our customers are going, I think that's critical.","If you look at our Dynamic Connections, we hear every day that our customers say, we want to manage the network like we manage our cloud capabilities. And that's what we're doing. We're giving them the ability to manage their network along with managing their clouds in a seamless way, scaling bandwidth up, scaling bandwidth down, redirecting it, allowing their SDN capabilities to interact with our SDN capabilities. So, it's about us making sure that we have the right products and that we execute on delivering those products.","Again, back to Nick's questions, I think we can always do better than that, but I don't see any particular pricing intensity or competitive intensity out there that we haven't seen for a while.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Just two quick follow-ups, so when customers do that transformation, are they growing the revenues they spend with you or are they shrinking? And secondly, longer term, can you update us on what you're thinking about for EBITDA margins? Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. With respect to are they growing, first of all, we just launched this product, the one I was just talking about, in October. So it's a little early for us to really have much headwind on or much traction on selling that product, but we expect to grow revenue from it.","We expect to expand our addressable market by being able to serve more customers. We expect to be able to use a variety of access technologies. So I mentioned a customer may have an MPLS site, they may have an SD-WAN site, they may have a broadband connection to us. We want to be able to use all of those different locations to pull content or interaction then with the cloud or cloud service provider. And so I expect it to grow revenue, and I expect it to really expand our addressable market for who we can sell to.","And, Neel, do you want to take the second part of that?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. So if you look at our EBITDA margins, we've already expanded EBITDA margins by 380 basis points or so from year ago. And if you think about all the comments Jeff made about digital cost transformation and we're leaning in on building fiber to more and more buildings, so we have major initiatives underway in terms of off-net to on-net. So those things will continue to expand our EBITDA margins, so we feel pretty good about continuing to expand EBITDA margins.","Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great, thank you. So is there any investment that's required ahead of the digitization for the costs, any systems you've got to acquire or ramping up some head count? And then where did total company head count end up at the end of the quarter? And what was it, say, a year ago?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","So, Frank, there's a ton of things that we have to invest in to make sure that we continue our digital transformation. Right now, what we're investing in on our Consumer business is doing that user-centered design effort that I discussed, where we're talking to customers, we're looking at how they want to utilize our products, we're looking at how they want to interface, and we're going to then build those capabilities into our system.","So is there any particular thing? No. Are there a lot of things that we have to do? Yes. If you think about dispatching our field forces, I don't want somebody having to call a technician to tell them where to go. I want them pulling down their map and the system automatically routing them and looking at our workforce and where everybody is and predictive analytics to tell when they're going to be completed and route our people more efficiently. And so there are lots of things that will go into our digitalization and digital transformation as a company. Neel, do you want to take the second?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","So in terms of head count, Frank, we were at 52,500 or so at close, and we're at about 46,000 now.","Frank Garreth Louthan - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you very much.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed, your line is open.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Spencer for Simon. Thanks for taking the question. Some of your wireline peers have talked about the success they're having with SD-WAN physically going after MPLS revenue. I think earlier this year, you said your MPLS revenue was growing around 3%. Is that still about the right rate?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I don't know the exact rate, but it's low single digits, and somewhere in there. And yes, it is still growing. So look, I've been very clear about this. I think SD-WAN is a great product for us in certain locations. MPLS is a great product for us in certain locations. It's the strength of the CenturyLink product portfolio that when it comes to networking services, it does not matter what type of networking application you're trying to build. We can provide services to do that. And I think that's a real strength because within every one of our customers, they have different sites that need different needs.","It's not a, I need dark fiber to every solution or I need a wave to every solution. They need dark fiber to some locations, they need waves to some locations, they need SD-WAN to some locations. And so it's one of the strengths that we look at in our product portfolio. And the customer example I gave you today, there is a healthy MPLS portion of that network and there's a healthy SD-WAN portion of that network.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, and then just a follow-up to one of the earlier questions. The quarter-over-quarter revenue decline doubled to $80 million this quarter. Would you say the impact of grooming less profitable revenue was higher this quarter than 2Q?","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah, I think that's the math I just went through, $30 million of that was the impact from those contracts and CPE and FX. And in addition to that, keep in mind, if you're looking at Business markets, wholesale there was a settlement, a large settlement last quarter, and so you see just a sequential decline just from that settlement not happening again.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And look, I know when we have revenue declines coming from unprofitable contracts that that can cause questions. I'm telling you, this is a good thing from an EBITDA and a free cash flow perspective. And the things that we manage this business for free cash flow, free cash flow per share, these are good things to be doing.","Spencer Gantsoudes - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure, Spencer.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Michael Rollins with Citi. Please proceed. Your line is open.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two if I could. The first one is we look at your disclosed financials. What are the things that you would point investors to, to better understand when you could see an inflection in the aggregate revenue performance in terms of the opportunity for that to get better? And then the second question is just a technical question. I noticed that in the supplemental package, you didn't provide the net income to cash flow to operations reconciliation that I think you've historically provided. Is there any specific reason that you did not disclose that in the current package? Thanks.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I don't have any idea on the second one. I'll look to Neel.","Neel Dev - CenturyLink, Inc.","Yeah. No, we'll look into that. If we missed something, we'll make sure that that gets posted.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","With respect to the inflection point on revenue, we don't give revenue guidance and what we will do at the end of the fourth quarter, we will begin to look at 2019 and figure out what we want to be talking about throughout 2019. The main thing I would look at is EBITDA. Look at our EBITDA expansion that we've talked about. Look at our EBITDA guidance. We raised our EBITDA guidance in the last quarter. Look at our free cash flow. We raised our free cash flow last quarter.","We raised it again this quarter because of lower CapEx, but that's also because we're being diligent and disciplined in the way that we spend capital, that we're not doing it just because we've spent it that way before or just because we spent it on copper technologies before, we're not going to do some of those things. And we're looking for how to deploy our capital very effectively and very efficiently. And so I look at EBITDA, I look at free cash flow, I would look less at revenue, but when it comes to the fourth quarter call, we will be thinking about those things again, and talk about what kind of guidance we'll give going forward for 2019.","Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure, Mike. Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'd like to wrap up the call with a couple of key points. We've made great strides over this last year with the integration of Level 3 and we're really well ahead of our synergy objectives achieving $790 million in adjusted EBITDA run rate synergies through the end of the third quarter.","Our focus on execution, financial and operating discipline and profitable revenue growth are providing us the results we envisioned with the continued margin expansion and the growth in adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow per share. We shifted our focus to transform CenturyLink to enhance our business for effectiveness, cost efficiency and customer experience, which will move us to where we want to be as a company.","Thank you for joining today's call and for your support at CenturyLink.

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","Tony Davis","Thank you, Saeed. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's second quarter 2014 results released earlier this afternoon. The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for question-and-answers.","Now turning to slide 2, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for third quarter 2014 and other outlooks in our business. We ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.","We ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures.

Glen?","Glen Post, III","Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased with our strong financial performance for the second quarter, and we continue to effectively execute against our objectives and make investments that we believe will drive increased revenues.","If you'll turn to slide 5, we achieved total operating revenue, operating cash flow and adjusted diluted earnings per share, all exceeded our guidance for the quarter. Our second quarter 2014, total operating revenues are $4.54 billion, increased by $16 million compared to the second quarter of 2013. This 0.4% revenue growth for the business, is a significant improvement from the 1.9% decline in year-over-year revenues in the second quarter 2013, and 1.2% decline in pro forma year-over-year revenues in the second quarter 2012.","Data integration revenue is $20 million higher in the second quarter 2014, and in the second quarter 2013, primarily due to increased CPE or customer premise equipment sales. Core revenue, which represents strategic and legacy revenues combined, were $4.1 billion for the quarter, and was nearly flat from the year ago period. This comparison also represents a significant improvement from the 1.6% and 2.2% declines in year-over-year core revenues in second quarter 2013 and 2012 respectively.","Now continuing to slide 6, I'd like to highlight the key drivers for this continued strong improvement on our revenue trend. The improvement in core revenues was driven by the combination of improved rate of growth in strategic revenue and lower rate of decline in legacy revenue. Business at core revenue grew sequentially and year-over-year, driven by business demand for high bandwidth data services and our bundled service offerings, combining network, CPE, software applications and managed services.","We also continue to see good growth in Ethernet services from our fiber-to-the-tower investments in our wholesale business, as we meet the growing data transport needs of wireless carriers. However, wholesale revenue growth continues to be impacted by the migration of low speed data services to fiber-based Ethernet, as well as increased network grooming by wireless carriers.","Managed hosting revenue including cloud were 9.6% year-over-year, while collocation revenue grew approximately 2%, resulting in total hosting revenue growth of 3.2% compared to the second quarter of 2013.","Additionally, if you look at our combined business and hosting segment revenues, we have achieved year-over-year revenue growth for the last eight quarters. Consumer revenue grew year-over-year, fueled by continued strength in high speed internet and Prism TV customer growth, price increases and improved churn.","Now turning to slide 7, we continue to transform our company from a provider of traditional network communications, to an integrated provider of IP-enabled network, cloud hosting and IT services, and we are refining our focus and executing on several strategic priorities. We believe these priorities are key to successfully navigating the continued transformation of our company, and driving long term profitable growth and value for our shareholders.","Now the first of these, is to grow business network solutions. We expect to continue to focus on driving growth from high bandwidth data services, including MPLS, Ethernet, Wavelength and voice-over-IP or VoIP services, by providing reliable connectivity to meet the growing bandwidth needs of our business customers.","In the second quarter, we experienced continuous strength in sales for high bandwidth data services. Also as announced yesterday, we are expanding gigabit service to business customers in select locations in 16 cities through our fiber network, providing symmetrical broadband speeds up to 1 gigabit. This expansion provides an increased addressable market opportunity for our business sales teams, and ultra fast Ethernet quality speeds to our customers, live into cloud-enablement of their businesses.","We also believe our targeted marketing approach, sales programs and continued expansion of our sales team, as well as continued enhancement of our product portfolio, positions us well to drive revenue growth. For example, we are seeing continued strong sales results associated with our launch of Managed Office, a solution that integrates network, voice-over-IP, email and other key business applications for our business customers. And although slowing somewhat from the levels of last years, we continued our fiber deployment to wireless towers, to capture the growing demand from wireless carriers or data backhaul. During the second quarter, we completed fiber to 500 towers for a total of near 19,700 total fiber builds.","With respect to our cloud and hosting business, we believe we have the right assets to meet the growing demand for cloud hosting and collocation services we achieved from businesses ranging from small to global in scale. These assets, coupled with our robust network capabilities, enable our sales teams to build integrated hosting and network solutions that meet the customers' needs, and lower their operating costs, while better enabling them to focus on our core businesses.","We continue to enhance our hosting and cloud services platform during the second quarter, with the launch of our Advanced CenturyLink Cloud technology to our Toronto data center, bringing our total 12 nodes, with the new technology. Additionally, interest eh second quarter, we opened a new data center in Minneapolis, offering collocation, cloud and managed hosting services connected to CenturyLink's IP backbone and global data center footprint.","We are further enhancing our ability to compete in the growth of hosting services of building and leveraging our broad IP capabilities to offer mid to large enterprise customers, and a complete portfolio of IP, cloud enablement consulting services.","We have strong public cloud products, but we are fully aware that there is strong competition in this space. We do believe though, that we are well positioned to compete and win in the hybrid cloud market, as we offer the full range of network, cloud, managed hosting, collocation and IP services that we believe our customers want and need. We are rapidly expanding and enhancing our capabilities for the managed hosting cloud space as well.","Continuing on to slide 8; in the consumer segment, we continue to see good results from those markets, where we have deployed higher bandwidth in IPTV services. For example, since our limited gigabit service deployment in Omaha, the results continue to exceed our expectation in the consumer market, and we are seeing good results in the small and medium business space as well.","Yesterday, along with our gigabit service inspection of our businesses, we also announced that the availability of gigabit service to residential customers in select locations in nine cities, includes some of our larger markets, like Minneapolis, St. Paul, Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas and Portland. We also expect to continue to invest in our Prism TV capabilities, we plan to add approximately 300,000 Prism TV addressable homes in 2014.","We continue to monitor the success of Prism TV in our current markets, and will consider further expansion in the months ahead.","Finally, we are focused on driving improved operating efficiency through a number of methods, including network simplification and rationalization that should improve our NDN provisioning time and help drive standardization. Also, we are focusing on process automation improvement through applications and work tools that better drive lower operating costs, and that we expect to improve sales efficiency. We continue to modernize our network replacing ATM with IP technology, which enables higher bandwidth -- broadband speeds for customers, while adding network capacity to our growing customer base. Since January, we have added over 2 terabytes to our IP backbone, bringing our total capacity to 18 terabytes per second.","And we have continued to manage expenses related to legacy service about aligning our expenses, and reduced revenues in that sector. Lastly, we have laid the foundation to migrate our internal IP operations to our cloud platform by investing in virtualization.","Since 2011, we have consolidated our internal IT operations for more than 10 data centers to four data centers. We are also using a Cloud First approach to rapidly deploy the same innovative platform, infrastructure and software to service solutions across to internal IP operations that we are selling through our cloud and IP hosting customers. We are on track to have 90% of all new and strategic internal IT applications in the cloud by the end of 2015.","Overall, I am pleased with the strong results for the quarter. We remain focused across all operating segments from offering our customers high value products and service solutions, along with the high quality customer experience we believe brings loyalty and improves customer attention. And we continue to invest to drive growth in our business.","With that I will turn the call over to Stewart for an in-depth look at our financial results and third quarter guidance. Stewart?","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","Thank you, Glen. I will spend the next few minutes reviewing the financial highlights from the second quarter, and then conclude my remarks with an overview of the third quarter 2014 guidance, we had included in our earnings issued earlier this afternoon.","Beginning on slide 10, I'd like to review some highlights from a strong second quarter results. I will be reviewing the results excluding special items as outlined in the earnings release, and associated financial schedules.","As Glen mentioned earlier, we generated strong operating revenues and cash flows in the quarter. Operating revenues were $4.54 billion on a consolidated basis, and a 0.4% increase from second quarter 2013 operating revenues. Core revenue, defined as strategic revenue plus legacy revenue, was $4.1 billion for the second quarter, nearly flat from the year ago period. Strategic revenues grew 5.1% year-over-year, and now represent 51% of our total revenues, compared to 48% a year ago.","Strategic products, such as high speed internet, high bandwidth data services, Prism TV, and managed hosting services continues to drive this growth. Additionally, customer growth was solid, as we added approximately 16,000 Prism TV customers during the second quarter. Due to typical seasonality, high speed internet customers declined 2,100 in the quarter, which was better than the loss of approximately 8.400 customers in second quarter of 2013.","We generated strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.81 billion for the second quarter and achieved an operating cash flow margin of 39.9%. The year-over-year decrease in operating cash flow and operating cash flow margin, was primarily driven by higher customer premise equipment sales, expenses related to the growth of Prism TV, a higher USF contribution factor, and the continued decline in legacy revenues.","Additionally, we generated $677 million of free cash flow during the quarter, which is defined as operating cash flow less cash paid per taxes, interest and capital expenditures, and additional adjustments to other income. As strong cash flows continue to provide us the financial strength and flexibility, to meet our business objectives and drive long term shareholder value.","We continue to expect our dividend payout ratio for full year 2014 to be approximately 45%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $0.72, including approximately $0.03 of favorable one time items. If you exclude these items, we still exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance for the quarter.","As we have discussed on prior earnings calls, adjusted diluted EPS excludes special items and certain non-cash purchase accounting adjustments, as outlined in our press release, and associated supplemented financial schedules.","We are pleased to announce the completion of our $2 billion stock repurchase program authorized by our board in mid-February 2013. Although the program was originally slated for a two-year completion timeframe, we executed opportunistically and repurchased 59.5 million shares in less than 18 months. Also during the quarter, we commenced the $1 billion follow-on program authorized by our Board earlier this year.","Across both programs, we have repurchased 4.5 million shares for an investment of $160 million during the second quarter, of which 1.2 million shares were under the $1 billion follow-on program. From the end of the quarter through yesterday, we have repurchased an additional 1.4 million shares for approximately $52 million. We expect to continue our opportunistic approach to repurchasing shares under the current $1 billion authorization.","Now turning to slide 11; the $16 million or 0.004% increase in second quarter 2014 operating revenues compared to second quarter 2013 was primarily a result of growth in strategic and data integration revenues, that was partially offset by lower legacy revenues, due to access line losses and lower minutes of use. The growth in our strategic revenues is primarily driven by strength in high speed internet, high bandwidth data services, Prism TV and hosting services. Although legacy revenues continue to decline, the decline in the second quarter 2014 was approximately 25% lower than the second quarter revenue decline a year ago. Data integration revenues were higher year-over-year, due to increased CPE sales.","Now turning to slide 12, I will discuss each of our operating segments, beginning first with the consumer segment. Consumer generated $1.5 billion in operating revenues, which grew slightly from second quarter 2013. Strategic revenues in this segment grew 8.6% year-over-year to $709 million, driven by growth in high speed internet and Prism TV customers, price increases and improved churn.","Legacy revenues for the segment declined 6% from second quarter 2013, as access line and long distance revenue declines, were partially offset by select price increases. The comparable year-over-year decline in second quarter 2013 was 9.3%. So a decline in legacy revenues of 9.3% second quarter a year ago, versus a 6% second quarter this year. Our operating expenses increased 4.4% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily driven by higher Prism TV costs.","Moving to slide 13, our business segment generated more than $1.56 billion in operating revenues during the second quarter, which increased $39 million or 2.6% from the same period a year ago. Second quarter strategic revenues for the segment increased by 7.8% to $663 million from second quarter a year ago, driven primarily by strength in high bandwidth services such as MPLS, Ethernet and Wavelength.","We continue to generate solid growth across the enterprise customer mix, and we continue to see an opportunity for further investment in the small and midsized business space, to improve our market share and drive further growth. Legacy revenues for the segment declined 3.9% from second quarter 2013, due primarily to continuing decline in access lines.","Data integration revenues grew 12% in second quarter 2014, compared to second quarter a year ago, driven by higher CPE sales. Total business segment expenses were up 6.6%, primarily driven by higher CPE costs and facility costs associated with the MPLS product growth, along with higher employee related expenses. The segment margin of 37.9% declined from 40.2% a year ago, this decrease was primarily due to the higher costs I just mentioned, along with the continued decline in business segment legacy revenue.","Now turning to slide 14, our wholesale segment generated $866 million in operating revenues, a decline of 4.8% from second quarter of 2013. Strategic revenues for wholesale were $568 million, nearly flat with the second quarter 2013, as growth in Ethernet services and wireless bandwidth expansion was offset by DS1 disconnect. Legacy revenues declined by 12.1% to $298 million, reflecting the continued decline in access and long distance minutes of use, and the implementation of lower access rights, under the KF order. Operating expenses for the quarter declined $18 million or 6% compared to the same period a year ago, driven by lower employee related and facility costs.","Now moving to slide 15 and our hosting segment, which includes all managed hosting, cloud services, collocation and hosting related network services revenue. This segment generated $358 million in operating revenues, representing an increase of 3.2% from second quarter 2013. Year-over-year managed hosting revenues including cloud grew 9.6%, while collocation growth of nearly 2% was impacted by customer churn and price erosion. Hosting operating expenses increased 3.9%, primarily due to higher employee costs.","Second quarter segment margin for hosting was 26.3%, an improvement from 22.6% in first quarter 2014. We anticipate further segment margin improvement for hosting in the last half of the year. Over time, we expect long term improvement in both revenue and margin trends across the hosting segment, and we continue to leverage these assets, to drive additional revenue, through cross-selling opportunities in our other segments.","Now turning to slide 16, and our third quarter 2014 guidance. For the third quarter 2014, we project total operating revenues of $4.47 billion to $4.52 billion; core revenues of $4.06 billion to $4.11 billion and operating cash flow between $1.72 billion and $1.77 billion. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range from $0.58 to $0.63. We expect third quarter 2014 revenues and operating cash flow to be lower than second quarter 2014, primarily due to continued decline of legacy revenues, and increased operating expenses related to the normal seasonality of outside plant, maintenance and utility costs. We expect $20 million to $30 million of higher seasonal, outside plant, maintenance and utility costs in third quarter versus second quarter.","We also anticipate an additional $0.02 to $0.03 per share impact in third quarter, due to increased depreciation related to capital investment made during the first half of the year.","Finally, as I mentioned earlier, there were approximately $0.03 per share of favorable one time items in second quarter, which will not occur in third quarter, including approximately $0.015 of operating expenses, and $0.015 related to the adjusted effective tax rate and interest expense. So we got a benefit in the second quarter of $0.03 that will not reoccur again in the third quarter. Our full year 2014 guidance remains unchanged, from that provided on our February earnings call.","This concludes our prepared remarks for today. So at this time, I will ask the operator to provide instructions for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from David Barden from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead, sir.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I guess I have to ask the obligatory question on kind of your reaction to the Windstream PLR announcement. What they are planning on doing in terms of separating the company into two parts, and how they use that to kind of finesse the dividend cut into the business and kind of -- if you could kind of walk us through what you have thought along these lines, and what you're thinking now that Windstream has a PLR in the world, it will be helpful. And then second, there is a lots of math we can start doing on the guidance, but maybe Stewart, just focusing on the revenue guidance, if I look at the third quarter guidance, do the math on the full year and implied fourth quarter revenue guidance, it implies -- at the midpoint, something like a $80 million stepdown in revenues from 3Q, 4Q, which based on the last eight quarters, seems like pretty unlikely.","So, you're steering towards the high end of the revenue guidance at the moment. Could you talk a little bit about what are kind of the focus issues for getting there, and is it possible that we are actually going to see revenue growth this year, rather than next? Thanks.","Glen Post, III","So David first, reaction to the Windstream announcement. We see a lot of opportunity to create value for shareholders by operating our assets as we do today, and we complete -- we are pleased with our continued trend for revenue stability. However, we continually evaluate the best ways to deliver long term shareholder value, and as such, we will monitor the Windstream restructuring process as it moves forward. So we will just monitor as they move first quarter, and evaluate it over time, as opposed to the short time period we have had, since its end market reaction that we have had, since they announced.","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","So the -- from a standpoint of the revenue guidance and -- we would expect to be towards the top end of the revenue guidance that we gave for the full year. In fact, if you look at all of the guidance that we gave related to full year, which we gave early February, we would expect to be at the upper end of that guidance or in the at least the top half of that guidance. For each item, with the exception of our operating cash flow, and basically, the operating cash flow we would expect to be more towards the midpoint, the reason being, expenses really related to the higher revenue than we expected, primarily expenses related to the CPE and Prism TV content costs.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect, thank you. And if I could just ask one more clarification Stewart, just on the number, you talked about the $0.015 benefit to the operating expense items, which I guess would be about $8.5 million in after taxes, maybe $12 million before taxes, could you talk about where that shook out in the numbers we saw this quarter?","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","Yeah, probably a penny of it was due to ad valorem tax true-ups in operating expenses, and the other $0.05 really related to employee benefits.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Perfect. All right thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thanks very much. Good evening. We are seeing a number of transactions in this space, including in the CLEC space and the data center space over the last few weeks. Can you just comment on -- I am sure you looked at some of those, how you're thinking about M&A right now, and your various parameters there, as you think about deploying capital organically, versus acquisition? And you expanded your 1 gigabit footprint. Can you give us a little bit more color around the scale of that? Any CapEx implications and what was really the trigger that got you comfortable with moving forward around the business model for that? Thank you.","Glen Post, III","Simon, regarding M&A, and how we look at that. First of all, we believe the investment we are making in the business today, are really positioning us well to compete and drive revenue growth. As we have discussed today and have seen in our numbers, then join the strategic service products we have developed and are selling and growing well and moving towards revenue stability. We are obviously monitoring and dealing with the industry's consolidation activity and look at numerous opportunities throughout the year.","As I have said, we are open to that. We think there are opportunities that could create growth and drive value for shareholders. But as I said before, our preference for inorganic growth would be, for opportunities that fit well with our strategic priorities. Those that can enhance our revenue and cash flow trajectory in particular.","We have considered investments that would enhance our broadband offering for business or consumers or both. We look at opportunities that would improve our metro fiber capability, and opportunities to invest -- for investments that would expand our data hosting capabilities. And we think all three of these could drive growth. But whatever those opportunities are, we will continue that and [indiscernible] over the last year to use our disciplined approach to these opportunities, which in our view, requires several things. First of all, the right strategic fit, especially the ability to improve our growth profile. Secondly, we have to see free cash flow accretion within a reasonable period of time, and then a clear path to creating value for shareholders. So those makes the three criteria we use, and we look at every opportunity that comes our way within that framework, and we think there are potential deals out there, but nothing that we talk about right now.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thank you. And on the 1-gig product?","Glen Post, III","The 1-gig expansion, we expect to do that within our current budget, first of all, within the $30 billion [ph] or so budget we have. So we do not expect the budget expansion for that.","Secondly, we believe that 1-gig, just taking the fiber, the home and fiber of these businesses, somewhat future proofs accompanying our operations, and we think -- we have looked at, compare that to fiber-to-the-node, and we believe that in some of these cities that we are in, that we can drive greater growth, greater consistency of growth throughout this -- through the 1-gig product, versus some of the fiber-to-the-node of what we have done previously. So that's how we are considering this, and we have had really good success in the markets we have entered with our gig product. So we expect to continue to expand, and not only that, we are starting this investment with going to the business, by taking fiber and the gig service to our business customers throughout these markets. And going from there into offering our prism service in these residential areas, as we can take the fiber network, build sort of the gig network we are building for the businesses, and take it through these residential areas to drive our fiber products. So we are seeing good growth there as well, as we have talked about today already.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Batya Levi from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS","Great, thank you. Maybe a follow-up on the CapEx question. Can you provide a little bit color on the breakdown, which projects do you think will come off the CapEx budget this year, and how much do you expect to spend on fiber next year? And how should we think about further IPTV investments? Thank you.","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","So Batya, if you think about our capital budget for this year, what we expect to spend in 2014, which again includes the markets, spending for the markets that Glen just discussed. About half of our capital budget is really what we would consider to be revenue enablement. Its associated with the Ethernet, EPLS and enablement, our cloud hosting, high speed internet enablement, so that would be the category this would fall in. About 28% of our capital budget is what we'd consider to be success-based, which really is the -- just success based sales of fiber-to-the-tower, our national sales, set-top boxes, things like that, and then about 22% of the $3 billion is what we consider maintenance CapEx, which basically just keeps the likes of it.","Batya Levi - UBS","And IPTV going forward?","Glen Post, III","We would expect -- I mean our capital budget for next year, we would expect it to be within the $3 billion range, plus or minus $100 million or so, probably.","Batya Levi - UBS","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Phil Cusick from JP Morgan.","Eric Pan - JP Morgan","Hi. This is Eric in for Phil. You guys have seen good growth last couple of quarters in strategic services, what's driving that momentum? Is it your salesforce becoming more effective, or are you seeing a pickup in business spending? Are you selling to new customers or existing customers for the most part?","Glen Post, III","Phil, I think I will ask Karen to address that.","Karen Puckett","First off, it is the demand for bandwidth products like MPLS, Ethernet has been very good growth for us. We continue to, I think, take share there, relative to a large global account, as well as enterprise. So I would say, that would be the key. Sales organization continued to perform. Our run rate continued to improve. We had stretched targets on this year and are hitting those. And then our Managed Office managed services, we are seeing -- very pleased with our follow [ph] in terms of just IT organizations, heads of businesses, really very curious and willing to outsource more of their IT and infrastructure services. And so we are well positioned, we believe there.","Eric Pan - JP Morgan","Okay, great. And then operating expenses were higher probably to CPE. How much of the growth in strategic revenues are coming from CPE sales, versus data and managed services? And how should we think about that elevated level of operating expenses going forward?","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","So about $29 million over what we had expected to be -- operating expenses to be for the quarter, where CPE expenses in excess of what we had anticipated, that were driven by the higher sales and higher revenue.","Glen Post, III","I'd just add Stewart, expense levels, we are seeing drive most of our expenses, our strategic service such as rollout of Prism, turning a lot of our expense growth, as well as other strategic services, have you looked at the -- well the really expense growth coming from outside of CPE and just the sales and marketing and cost of [indiscernible] services.","Eric Pan - JP Morgan","Should we expect this level to remain high going forward?","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","Yes. I mean, as our revenue grows with the strategic products, especially the Prism TV products and some of the out of market, MPLS networks that we are selling, where we have third party costs associated with the last mile, the margins on that revenue is going to be lower than margins on the legacy revenue. So the expenses would grow over time, as the revenue grows.","Eric Pan - JP Morgan","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Hey guys, thanks. Stewart, maybe just expand upon that last comment, because it looks like the revenue offset sort of getting to your flattish-type year-over-year growth. At an almost equal decline in legacy as improvement in strategic and EBITDA was down only about $25 million year-over-year, just trying to get a sense? I know, you're just talking about the significant margin differences in those revenue streams. It would appear, based upon the EBITDA decline that the incremental margins might be a little bit tighter than we thought. Alternatively, SG&A might be the driver there. I am trying to get a sense for what kind of pressure we can see downward on SG&A as we go forward? Thanks.","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","Mike. I think its more the mixed CPE revenue and the growth that we have seen there over a year ago, or over the last year, is really driving the expense growth that you're seeing there and the margin pressure.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Okay. And just secondly on the working capital side, it looks like you had a bit of a headwind in the quarter. Is that just the timing difference that will even out as the year goes on?","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","Yes, it is.","Mike McCormack - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Frank Louthan from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Great. Thank you. So looking at some of the improvements and the declines in the legacy revenue, can you give us some color on that, as just of a shrinking base there, is it something else you're doing? And then also on the cost side, you mentioned sort of managing some of the costs in that business? What sort of specific tactics are you doing to take the costs out of that part of the business?","Glen Post, III","So Frank, on the revenue side, so the second quarter -- as the first quarter benefited, the second quarter also benefited from some price increases that we did in the third quarter a year ago, on some of the legacy products. So we will cycle through that, after the second quarter of this year. And the comps will be a little bit tougher in the third quarter. Additionally, we did some price increases early part of this year too, that benefited second quarter as well. So I think that's what you are seeing -- that's helping the revenue decline on legacy. Additionally, our access point loss related to our customer loss, right, continues to decline somewhat.","Stewart Ewing, Jr.","On the cost side, we are doing continual cost improvement programs and we talked about some of those on our network. We are going to replace ATM with IP technology. We have consolidated data centers in the last year, since it -- which are impacted by the legacy revenue losses. We are removing more of the cloud type IT services that's reducing our costs as well. So we have done a lot of these things that are going over that desk, where we are specifically targeting, especially areas that are cost drivers in the legacy area.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Thanks. Just a follow-up. Are there any other sort of cost increases you might be able to push through on some of those legacy products that have relatively reasonable -- reasonably favorable impacts on the churn, relative to some other things, or any sort of caps induced, or authorized price increases that we might be able to expect over the next 12 months?","Glen Post, III","So product was the access rate reductions, that went into effect July 1st. We expect to really pretty much be able to offset that through additional arc that we will charge our customers, which effectively is a price increase to the customers, and we are also looking at some of our other products too, that we could potentially tweak prices on a little bit in the latter half of the year. But nothing significant.","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And I am showing no further questions at this time. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Glen Post for any closing remarks.","Glen Post, III","Thank you, Saeed. Overall, we are well pleased with our second quarter operating and financial results, and seeing improvement especially in our revenue trend. We believe the investments in our business continue to transform our company and position us to effectively compete in the marketplace and drive revenue growth from our strategic products and services in the months and years ahead.","Thank you for joining our call today and we look forward to speaking with you in the coming weeks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This includes our program for today. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day. Thank you."],"5080":["CenturyLink, Inc. (NYSE:CTL) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call August  7, 2019  5:00 PM ET","Company Participants","Valerie Finberg - VP of IR","Jeff Storey - President and CEO","Neel Dev - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Batya Levi - UBS","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley","Philip Cusick - JPMorgan","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs","Frank Louthan - Raymond James","Nick Del Deo - MoffettNathanson","Tim Horan - Oppenheimer","David Barton - Bank of America","Mike McCormack - Guggenheim","Operator","Greetings and welcome to the CenturyLink\u2019s Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, August 07, 2019.","It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Valerie Finberg, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Valerie.","Valerie Finberg","Thank you, France. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink second quarter 2019 earnings call. With us on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer and Neel Dev, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we get started, I need to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2 of our 2Q19 presentation, which notes that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures. Those reconciliations can be found in our earnings press release or our supplement schedule. Additionally, please note that certain metrics discussed on the call today exclude transformation costs and other special items as noted in our earnings materials.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Storey","Thanks, Valerie, and thank you to everyone for joining us. On today's call, I'll give you an update on the state of the business. Neel will provide an overview of the quarter\u2019s financial results, and then we'll go directly to your questions.","I\u2019ll start by saying during the quarter, we continued to improve our customer experience, increased our business and wholesale sales sequentially, and expanded our adjusted EBITDA margins to 40.7%. The quarter\u2019s results continue to validate a core tenant of CenturyLink. By delivering outstanding products over a world-class infrastructure, with a primary focus on operational excellence, we can drive revenue, margin expansion, and bottom line profitability.","While we have a long way to go to simplify and streamline our internal operations and our customer interactions with CenturyLink, we certainly see the tangible results of our efforts that benefit both customers and shareholders. Since the close of the Level 3 acquisition, our adjusted EBITDA margins have expanded by more than 500 basis points. And as we've said previously, we already have identified 800 million to 1 billion in run rate transformation savings.","As of the end of the second quarter, our transformation initiatives delivered annualized run rate savings of 290 million, and we believe our results validate our ongoing ability to find, capture, and generate savings while focusing on profitable revenue growth.","During the quarter, we made good progress on our deleveraging objectives and our leverage ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA is now 3.8 times. We feel confident in our ability to meet our leverage target of 2.75 to 3.25 times within the next three years.","From a revenue perspective, while year over year total revenue declines -- increased slightly, we saw improvement in sequential total revenue performance. We also saw improved revenue performance in iGAM and Enterprise both year-over-year and sequentially. While you've heard me say before that progress is never linear, given the leading indicators in service delivery, sales, and our sales funnel, we continue to expect revenue for iGAM and Enterprise to be higher in the second half of this year compared to the first half.","I've mentioned on previous calls that we're investing to meet our customers growing and evolving needs. CenturyLink has what I believe to be the world's best, most scalable, and efficient fiber network. However, we continue investing and working hard to expand our infrastructure, broaden our service capabilities, and create a better digital experience for our customers and our employees. We also recognize that our customers\u2019 needs are continually evolving as technology advancements drive changes within their operating models.","I thought I'd give you a few recent examples that illustrate where we see the market going, and how we are investing to drive growth in our business. As I mentioned last quarter, we added 4,500 new fiber-fed buildings to our on-net footprint in the first quarter of 2019. We continued that focus in the second quarter with the addition of approximately 5,000 new fiber-fed buildings. For contrast, Level 3 used to add something closer to 500 buildings per quarter, so I want to emphasize expanding our fiber footprint is a major area of focus for us.","We know that when we have a building on-net, our fiber based services provide a better, more reliable, and higher margin solution than competing infrastructure. [indiscernible] wireless whether that's 5G or not, fiber wins. It's highly flexible and increasing speeds, it is secure and really is the basis for all the other competing technologies. We just do one thing differently. We take fiber all the way to the customer, and customers always want fiber when they can get it. You can expect us to continue investing to expand the reach of our access fiber network.","Beyond just being a superior technology, though, fiber is well suited to meet the demands of emerging opportunities driven by artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data applications. Fiber-based solutions are better able to satisfy what we see as four key market trends. The need for highly scalable capacity, now ranging into multi gigabits per second; the need for connecting and increasing number of widely distributed locations; the need for the network itself to protect the privacy and security of our customers; and finally, the need to move bandwidth intensive computing resources closer and closer to the edge to reduce latency and unnecessary backhaul of traffic.","Expanding our on-net building footprint certainly helps us meet these needs. But we've implemented a number of other initiatives to ensure CenturyLink maintains our position as the premier fiber based provider for enterprise customers.","Turning to slide 4 in our presentation, last quarter, we showed a similar map illustrating our North American subsea fiber routes. This is a unique asset, and as I said earlier, we believe it represents the world's most scalable and efficient fiber network. However, we are further augmenting our capabilities. We also own an extensive and unparalleled conduit system that we leverage to bring the latest generation fiber capabilities to market with extraordinary speed and economic efficiency. Each of the long haul networks we've acquired Level 3, Qwest, WilTel, Broadwing all had multi conduit builds.","Within the Level 3 network alone, we built 12 conduits to ensure we had sufficient space to grow and evolve this capacity in fiber technology evolved. Most of those conduits are still available for further network augmentation. But we've also interconnected all of those conduit systems to cherry-pick the shortest and lowest latency pass across the country. As illustrated on slide five, we recently announced the deployment of Corning's latest generation of ultra-low loss fiber to build the world's best, most scalable optical infrastructure. This new technology enables higher capacity and more efficient optical design than earlier fiber technologies.","Coupled with the selecting the shortest physical path between any two endpoints, we also improved latency significantly, which is a key factor for hyper scalars, bandwidth intensive enterprises, and dark fiber customers. We've completed 3.5 million miles of our current plan to build a total of 4.7 million fiber miles with ultra-low loss fiber roughly 75%. We continue to see demand for additional routes, and we'll consider those to meet future customer needs.","We recognized that access and long haul transport only part of the solution. There's increasing demand for computing capabilities at the edge of the network, and we believe we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. In addition to our far-reaching fiber network, we operate a large number of edge locations that are well suited to enable edge computing. In the coming weeks. We expect to announce the details of our investments in our widely distributed and extremely well connected edge computing infrastructure.","Let me give you a specific example from a customer of what fiber-based edge computing capabilities can mean for them. Slide 6 shows an actual customer with close to 2,000 nationwide locations. We are working with this customer to evaluate the effectiveness of our edge computing solutions to more efficiently run applications and process huge amounts of data very close to the origin of that data. On this slide, you can see that our existing infrastructure is positioned within five milliseconds transport time for 95% of their sites. This means that the customers applications and data can be processed more efficiently from a 100 or so of our edge locations, rather than processed on premise at 2,000 separate sites, even worse with the customer or backhaul to a central location.","In addition, our dynamic networking capabilities can provide real-time network provisioning from the customer premise to our edge, and then onto major cloud service providers. This example is for a specific customer, but the results are indicative of what we see from other customers we are currently working with.","This application can be an important solution for retail, banking, and really anyone that has a number of dispersed service locations that need to process large amounts of data in real time. The combination of our fiber network with edge computing infrastructure and managed services support is a very powerful and differentiated service offering. We are not suggesting that edge computing will eliminate the need for today's hybrid computing or hybrid networking. To the contrary, our customers will continue to build and operate their own data centers, continue to move compute resources to public data centers and specific applications to cloud service providers.","Our customers want to dynamically manage their network and put different types of workloads in different environments. Through our wide array of hybrid networking solutions. CenturyLink provides the flexibility to do so easily. CenturyLink enables this flexibility with services like dynamic connections, which allows our customers to make instantaneous changes to their network, capacity, and configuration, and our cloud application manager, which allows customers to manage their applications across hybrid cloud environments through a single seamless interface.","Our network was purpose built to enable us to expand at the lowest cost in the industry. That's a big advantage. It allows us to go to market quickly and invest in these types of growth initiatives within the bounds of our ongoing capital plans. The sufficiency is demonstrated in our ability to invest in all of these initiatives as well as other growth opportunities within the scope of the capex outlook we provided for the full-year 2019.","Of course, the purpose of these investments is to drive growth. We are beginning to see the benefits of these capabilities improving our ability to win. I'll give you another specific customer example of how investments in flexible scalable fiber-based connectivity are helping us win in the market. We recently won a contract provide secured cloud connectivity to the US Census Bureau for the upcoming 2020 census. We will formally announce this contract later this week. To support the Census Bureau\u2019s objectives, to provide the best mix of timeliness, relevancy, quality, and cost for the data they collect and the services they provide, CenturyLink will help to collect the census digitally by providing the bureau with managed trusted internet protocol services or MTIPS at speeds of 40 gigabits and higher.","MTIPS, a managed security service that provides secure cloud-based connectivity, will support the online system that will be available to all households completing the 2020 survey. The solution also allows the Census Bureau to access the responses via secured-cloud applications for the first time. CenturyLink was selected by the Bureau due to our ability to meet their requirements for scalable connectivity and will play an integral role in helping the US Census go digital in the most secure, reliable, and cost effective way as it takes an important mission of completing the 2020 census.","The census is obviously a unique example, but that's the point of hybrid networking solutions from CenturyLink. Our customers can enable the capabilities to address their particular need. This solution highlights our ability to provide scalable, flexible network solutions that we believe are defining the next generation of enterprise networking.","Turning to our own internal transformation initiatives, as I noted earlier, we're making good progress in this area, exiting the quarter with around 290 million in annualized run rate saving. We appreciate the cost efficiencies and we know they are substantial, but the cost savings are almost a byproduct. The real value comes from the significant improvements in the service experience both for our customers and employees that result from an entirely digital interaction model. These improvements not only enhance margins, they increase customer satisfaction, reduce churn, and improve sales. This work is as important as anything we are doing in the business, and we are very focused on doing it well.","Neel will cover the specific results of the consumer business, but I will highlight that we're continuing to see success with our micro-targeting efforts. As a reminder, we micro-target where we build fiber and our micro-targeting our marketing and sales efforts too. We are continually expanding these efforts in new neighborhoods and additional cities, what we have said about our consumer business still holds, we will invest where we can grow revenue profitably, and we will grow where we invest. We are seeing the benefits of this approach and had more than doubled the number of subscribers with services at 100 megabits per second and higher since the second quarter of 2018. We will continue to push for higher market share in areas where we have invested to enable these higher speed.","I\u2019ll also note that related to the consumer business, we took a $15 million charge during the quarter in connection with a tentative settlement we reached in the nationwide consumer class action cases we've been defending since mid-2017. The agreement remains subject to judicial approval, but we're very pleased to have a tentative resolution of the class action claims behind us. We've been very focused on simplifying and improving our customer experience since before this litigation was initiated and feel good about the ongoing improvements we're seeing in that part of the business.","Before I turn the call over to Neel, I wanted to comment on the strategic review for our consumer business. Our internal team and our advisors are making good progress in the review. With that said, as we mentioned last quarter, this will be a lengthy and complex process, and we do not intend to provide updates until we have determined the best path forward. In the meantime, we are not modifying our consumer investment, and we are continuing to operate our consumer business to transform it and the services we offer.","I'll also reiterate something I touched on last quarter, and that is that this process is not unusual for us. We evaluate all aspects of our company on an ongoing basis to ensure we are using our assets to deliver the best value for our company and our shareholders. If we see opportunities to drive higher levels of value with alternative approaches, much like you see us undertaking in the consumer review, we will do the work necessary to understand our options and implement the options to provide the best free cash flow per share return.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results for the quarter. After that, we'll open it up for your questions. Neel?","Neel Dev","Thank you, Jeff. And good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our financial summary on slide 7. We grew adjusted EBITDA to 2.269 billion from 2.262 billion in the first quarter 2019. We expanded adjusted EBITDA margin over 500 basis points to 40.7% this quarter compared to 35.5% at the close of the Level 3 transaction.","We were able to accelerate our cost transformation initiatives and deliver 290 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings, and based on our continued progress today, we feel good about our financial performance and are reiterating our outlook for adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for the full-year 2019.","To put the first half of 2019 into perspective, we grew adjusted EBITDA by 80 million compared to the first half of 2018, while revenue declined more than 600 million over the same period. This was driven in part by our focus on adding profitable revenue in de-emphasizing unprofitable lines of businesses, managing legacy product declines, along with synergies and our cost transformation initiatives.","Turning to revenue on slide 8. Total revenue in the first quarter declined 5.5% to 5.58 billion. Quarter-over-quarter, total revenue declined 1.2% compared to the 2.3% sequential decline we saw last quarter.","As I just mentioned, last year, during the course of 2018, we implemented guardrails to drive profitable revenue, which has led to difficult year over year comparisons.","Our iGAM revenue was roughly flat compared to the second quarter 2018. Adjusting for FX, iGAM grew 1.6%. Sequentially, revenue increased 1.2% compared to a 3.5% decrease last quarter. We did see an impact to revenue this quarter from the contract rewrites that we mentioned last quarter. However, those revenue declines were offset by strength in non-recurring revenue items.","Keep in mind, this group contains some of our largest customers, and we could see revenue fluctuations in any given quarter based on rewrites or renegotiations, but over the long term, we feel confident in the trajectory of this business.","Moving to our enterprise segment, revenue declined 1.2% both year over year and sequentially. This compares to a decline of 1.6% year over year and 2.2% sequentially in the first quarter 2019.","Overall, looking to the second half of the year, for both iGAM and Enterprise, our sales funnel is strong, and we feel good about all the leading indicators for revenue growth. As such, we expect revenue for these two business segments to be higher in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019.","SMB revenue decreased 10% year over year compared to a decline of 3.7% in the first quarter 2019. Revenue in the second quarter 2018 included a benefit from several non-recurring items, making the year over year comp challenging. Sequentially, revenue declined 2.5% compared to a decline of 0.1% last quarter. As a reminder, in the first quarter 2019, we had particular strength in non-recurring revenue.","The revenue declines on the SMB business are largely driven by legacy voice. We feel good about our ability to sell into our on-net building footprint with a large addressable market opportunity. Wholesale revenue decreased 8.8% year over year. As we referenced last year, in the second quarter 2018, wholesale revenue included a favorable dispute settlement with a large carrier. Sequentially, we saw a decline of 1.8% compared to a 3.4% decline last quarter.","Slide 9 has our product mix by business segment. In both iGAM and Enterprise, we expect that sales growth in other product lines will offset legacy voice declines. In the SMB segment, despite sales growth, given voice represents 45% of total revenue, the journey will be a bit longer.","Turning to consumer on slide 9 [ph], second quarter 2019 revenue declined 8% year over year and 1.7% sequentially, and is generally in line with the revenue performance we saw in the first quarter 2019.","In the second quarter, we saw a net loss of 56,000 total broadband subs with declines of 78,000 in speeds below 20 meg and growth of 22,000 in speeds of 20 meg and above. Within those gains, we added 48,000 in speeds of 100 meg and above. I\u2019ll also note that growth in our greater than 100 meg subs is up more than 100% on a year over year basis.","Broadband revenue for the second quarter 2019 grew 1.8% year over year which compares to growth of 1.4% last quarter, driven by our efforts to increase penetration in our competitive assets and investing in fiber.","Voice revenue on a year over year basis declined 13% this quarter compared to 12% last quarter. The decline in other revenue continues to be driven by our decision to de-emphasize our Prism video product. Regulatory revenue is down year over year due to the adoption of new lease accounting standard.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on slide 11, for the second quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was 2.269 billion compared to 2.271 billion from the year ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 40.7% for the second quarter 2019 compared to 38.5% in the year ago quarter. We continue to focus on adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion, as we drive profitable revenue in our transformation efforts.","As of the end of the second quarter, we've achieved approximately 290 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings, we are pleased with our ability to accelerate transformation savings in the first half of 2019 and feel good about our progress going forward.","Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the second quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by 54 million and free cash flow by 55 million.","Overall, we continue to make progress in taking costs out of the business. Excluding transformation costs and special items, if you look at our adjusted EBITDA impacting costs for the second quarter 2019, we have reduced cost on an annualized basis by roughly 1.3 billion compared to where we were a year ago, and 2.3 billion since the close of the Level 3 transaction. The improvement in our cost structure is driven by a combination of synergies, transformation savings, and our focus on profitable revenue.","Moving to slide 12, for the second quarter 2019, capital expenditures were 800 million. For the first half of 2019, capital expenditures increased approximately 10% to 1.73 billion compared to 1.58 billion from the year-ago period.","As Jeff just mentioned, we continue to invest in our fiber footprint and product capabilities, positioning us to take advantage of existing and emerging market opportunities. In the second quarter 2019, the company generated free cash flow of 956 million.","Turning to slide 13, we exited the quarter with our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio at 3.8 times, which compares to 4.3 times at the close of the Level 3 transaction","We remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75 to 3.25 times net leverage target over the next three years. During the second quarter, we reduced outstanding debt by approximately 700 million, primarily through a tender offer open market purchases and term loan amortization.","In addition, we recently announced the redemption of 400 million in bonds that will close in late August and we expect to pay down an incremental $400 million of debt at maturity over the next few months. Overall, at this point, we have a clear line of sight to lowering debt by 1.7 billion through actions already taken or that are planned for the rest of the year.","Turning to the business outlook on slide 14, we feel good with our progress in the first half of the year and are reiterating our full-year 2019 financial outlook measures for adjusted EBITDA of 9 billion to 9.2 billion, free cash flow of 9.1 to 3, sorry, free cash flow of 3.1 billion to 3.4 billion and capital expenditures of 3.5 billion to 3.8 billion. Please note that we slightly adjusted our outlook for dividends paid and depreciation and amortization.","In summary, we remain focused on execution specifically on improving revenue trajectory for the second half of 2019, maximizing profitability and remain discipline on our cost transformation and deleveraging initiatives.","With that, we\u2019ll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi","First, little bit more color on the Enterprise trends if you could provide for the second half. I believe you typically see higher CPE sales. Can you parse out the improvement on regular services versus CPE? And just a follow up, I believe you mentioned a couple of non-recurring items in iGAM and wholesale in the quarter, any chance you could quantify those? And third, a lot of discussions on potential changes in terms of CAF subsidies that you collect right now. How do you think about that going forward? Would you -- would the -- I believe you collect about 500 million on an annual basis right now? Would you still be interested in participating in the auction next year? Thank you.","Neel Dev","Good. Batya, I think there's a lot of questions in there. So, if I miss any, we\u2019ll come back. So, on enterprise, if you think about our Enterprise segment, our sales in fourth quarter, and January and February were impacted by the government shutdown, but we saw good sales in March and we saw good sales in second quarter of this year. So, we got good sequential growth in sales. So given timing of installs and that's part of the reason we feel good about the second half of this year. On CPE, we've really de-emphasized on profitable CPE. So, our CPE revenue is down a fair amount on a year-over-year basis. So, the driver for enterprise growth is sales and installs. Just to put that in\u2026","Jeff Storey","And just to add, I apologize Neel, on the CPE, that's a conscious decision. That's something that we intentionally did. We still sell CPE. But we do it when it brings network with it when we can do managed services and professional services, when we can do things to increase the margin around it. But in the past, there were times when we would just sell CPE without any of those other services. And we stopped doing that, that doesn't make us money, distracts our organization, and that's one of the efforts around profitable revenue that we focused on.","Neel Dev","And just to put in the context, I think if you look at our enterprise, year-over-year, we're down about 1.2%, that\u2019s about 18 million or so. And last year, we terminated a government contract that was unprofitable, we de-emphasize low margin CPE sales, and we put a lot of guardrails around profitable business. So, in that context, we're fairly pleased with the performance of the enterprise business and the latter half of the year is driven by sales and installs.","In terms of iGAM, in the first quarter, I noted that we had a large renegotiation with a customer, hyperscaler customer and that drove sequential pressure on revenue. But we did offset that with non-recurring services, professional services, and other things and that was, call it, roughly around 15 million or so. And, again, in iGAM, we saw growth in sales sequentially and we feel good about the second half of the year.","My comment on wholesale one time was more related to the comment I made in first quarter, we had a large carrier renegotiation in the first quarter that impacted revenue, and we saw the full quarter impact of that in second quarter. And if you're looking at year-over-year for wholesale, second quarter of last year had a large carrier settlement that impacts the year-over-year comparison.","Jeff Storey","And then with respect to the CAF question and whether we\u2019ll participate in upcoming auction. The rule, the suggested rules have just come out. We've got a comment period, I think till the end of the year, we'll look at it and we'll see if it makes sense. And if it does for us, and we will participate in those auctions. And if it doesn't make sense, then we won\u2019t. If you look historically, there were some times we participated and sometimes we didn't. And so we will evaluate that, as the rules get finalized, and as we look at the specifics.","Neel Dev","Yeah. The other thing just to add to that I think keep in mind, on CAF, there is a capital offset as well. So to the extent that we\u2019re not getting funding at the revenue line, we're also not spending capital.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.","Simon Flannery","Great. Thanks a lot. Thank you for the color on the fiber deployment. Can you just give us a sense of, you know, how much that is costing and what -- what the timeline is to get to completion there? And maybe any thoughts about is this capital intensity likely to continue into 2020? And then any comments on M&A opportunities? I think you've talked about tuck-ins and maybe some international opportunities over time, but we haven't seen you do much for a while. And any color on what you might be interested in there would be great, thank you.","Jeff Storey","With respect to how much capital, we haven't given out any of that information, what I will tell you is, it's fully contemplated in our 2019 capital outlook that we provided and it's part of the growth initiatives that we talked about in previous earnings calls. The completion is -- is the end of 2021, but the majority of that long delay has to do with Europe, and North America, I don't have the exact date in front of me, but it's not a network where you got to wait until everything's turned up, we prioritize the routes based on the demand from our customers, we will activate those routes, we are in the process of activating them, we will install the fiber, you know, we\u2019ll continue to do that based on the prioritization that our customers want.","So, you know, we're really pleased with our ability to roll this out very quickly. If you -- if you have a network that's direct buried into the earth, it costs you an enormous amount to open a new trench. It costs you an enormous amount of time to get all the rights of way and all of that. And what we do is we [indiscernible] we pull the fiber directly into the conduits. It's very simple, very straightforward, and very cheap compared to the alternatives. So we're really pleased to use our -- our very extensive conduit network to take advantage of that.","With respect to M&A, we don't really talk about M&A before we do something, we will continue to be active and looking, we are an inquisitive company, we will make sure that anything we do is accretive to the business and free cash flow basis and functionality basis. And, so, we\u2019ll continue to look at that. But right now, our real effort is transforming CenturyLink. And looking at the way that we interact with our customers and creating an environment where we can do seamless things. I mentioned in the -- in the prepared remarks, our dynamic connections.","Dynamic connections for enterprise customers allow them to establish connectivity with us. And then use that connectivity by typing in a few keystrokes to either increase the speed or redirect it from one cloud service provider to another or one of their data centers to another and really give them the flexibility to use that in a digital way. The next step of that, obviously, is to create a connection between their systems and our systems where -- where their AI tells us to automatically upgrade that capacity or do something. And so -- so that's really the effort of ours over the next couple of years. And so there's some tuck-in type ideas that might make sense to go with that. But we don't talk about any specifics until we do something.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan, please go ahead.","Philip Cusick","I guess two. First on the consumer side, I recognize you don't want to talk about strategic options, can you tell us if you've ruled anything out at this point, or things that you may have talked about ruling out back in May, if those have possibly come back to the fore. And then sticking with the fiber bill, can you expand on your plans from here around Metro and long distance fiber? And how that fiber build may have impacted any dark fiber bookings? And how we should think about that going forward? Thanks very much.","Jeff Storey","Sure. I got distracted. On the consumer, first of all, I don't know anything that we might have said in May, if there's something specifically I\u2019ve said, remind me of it. But no, in answer to your question and I won't take any more questions on the consumer process just because it's still early in the process, and I don't have -- anything any real updates. But we haven't ruled anything out. We're open minded. And we think that it's important for us to look at all options, and including continuing to own and operate it. And so we're open to all of the various options, and really just trying to understand the best way to maximize free cash flow per share for our shareholders over the long time. ","And then the second question was on the overbuild and the impact that has on dark fiber. Is that right?","Philip Cusick","Correct. Thank you.","Jeff Storey","It has great impact on dark fiber. We are quietly a very large dark fiber sales company. We don't emphasize it that much externally. But we love it. We have great customers. This ultra-low loss fiber is important to our dark fiber customers and some of our dark fiber customers, not all of them, but hyper scalars. I mentioned, large enterprises that have huge bandwidth requirements. And then again, some of our dark fiber customers that are trying to serve their own needs internally. And so we think it'll be, we think it's a real opportunity for us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. And just to follow up on something you were discussing during your prepared remarks, Jeff, you\u2019ve talked about low calorie revenues and how you've been waiting the company off of products and services that weren't helpful to the bottom line for a while now. I still think your current period, top line results are being compared against prior periods where maybe there was more of that in the mix. So I guess I'm just trying to understand, do you think you've hit a lot of the significant opportunities to maybe get the mix from a profitability standpoint where you want to be, so that maybe will have better visibility into sort of the true organic trajectory of the business? Or do you still have more of this you want to do?","And then just overall, I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on the enterprise and iGAM demand environment. I feel like we've gotten mixed messages from some of your large peers about what the market environment is like, and I'm curious the extent to which the demand backdrop is influencing your view on where the second half of the year is going to shape out.","Jeff Storey","Sure. I'll answer the low calorie and then let Neel add any specifics he wants to do. I think it's getting behind us. There's not any super major low calorie revenue that we're targeting today. In the consumer business, we said we're going to de-emphasize the Prism linear TV. We\u2019ve deemphasized contracts and gotten out of contracts that we thought were underwater, we stopped selling CPE. A lot of that is still in the year over year comparisons, Brett. So that makes it kind of difficult, but if you start looking at the sequential comparisons, it'll be in there less and less. So I think that that going forward, we\u2019ll stop talking about that, even though there's going to be some here and there that affect us.","The other thing that we're trying to do though is with some of this low calorie revenue, we're trying to increase the profitability by moving things off net to on net. And then we will do rate hikes. And if we can -- if we can't make it profitable, then with rate hikes, and the customer may leave us. But those are small things around the edges. I think it's starting to fall out of the year over year comparisons, but it's going to be faster falling out of the sequential comparisons.","Neel Dev","Yeah, just to add a couple of, it really is around the edges, Brett. I think if you look in the other -- in the product breakdown for other for example, in consumer, that's where a lot of the Prism revenue is. So sequentially, it was down 6 million, 7 million. So that will continue. If you look at our IT and managed services products, that's where we have some of the legacy hosting, if you will, and some of that will continue to attract. So it really is around the edges. And that was part of the reason why we talked about in our enterprise and IGAM growth, we said second half will be higher than first half, because first half is relatively clean compared to last year where we were working through a lot of that.","Jeff Storey","And with respect to IGAM enterprise, the demand environment that we see, look, we love this business. We think there's great demand out there for the types of products and services that we sell, and that the demand is growing for those types of products and services. Now, some, there are some products that are going to decline as customers transition to that and transition to the newer products and services. And we think that's a good opportunity to go out and take share from other people and help those customers make that transition. So we think market is good for us. We think we have great assets and great network capabilities. We want to continue to expand that and augment it, adding 4500 buildings in the first Quarter gets us two more customers, adding 5000 buildings in the second quarter gets us to more customers, gives us a better footprint to deliver those services on. ","We know when we sell on net, we do a better job for the customer, we make more money. It's all around a good thing. And so, we look at the market, and I've said this for a long time, it's whether -- whether it's the market or the economy, we look at it and say it's up to us to execute. If CenturyLink executes in the way that we can with the network assets that we have, with the capabilities and the products and services and the managed services and all of those things, if we invest appropriately for growth continuing to augment our capabilities, we win. And so I don't really have any great comments on the market other than it's good for our products and services.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Frank Louthan with Raymond James, please go ahead.","Frank Louthan","Walk us through the current pricing in wholesale in general. And then I know you said you're not going to really touch too much on M&A. But can you -- are there other assets possibly that you might want to divest, to try and help with leverage maybe data centers or CDN business, something like that?","Jeff Storey","So I'll take the second question and then Neel can talk about the pricing. As I said in the previously on the -- in the answer and in the prepared remarks, we look at everything and we are not opposed to evaluating each individual business that we have each individual line of business, and we will continue to do those types of things. There's nothing I want to call out that that there are some things that we're actively looking at and have been since the -- over the past several months and we\u2019ll continue to do that. One of the things you got to do is you got to have a willing buyer and a willing seller. And we're in the process of figuring out, first of all, if we're willing seller, and secondly, if there's a willing buyer out there. ","Now that what we do know is that regardless of the particular product or the particular line of business, if we focus on growing free cash flow, then and we have options to whether we want to keep it or not keep it and so every part of our company, we are looking at how do we get it to contribute free cash flow. And if we don't think we can, for example, the Prism TV, if we don't think we can get it to contribute the level of free cash flow that we want, we\u2019ll stop doing it.","Neel Dev","On the pricing side, Frank, I would say overall, in the wholesale, I think your question was specific to wholesale. We see rational behavior and we follow the market fairly closely for access, particularly we see areas where others are raising prices, so we start to stay competitive. But if there is an opportunity to raise prices, we'd raise if there are multiple competitors, and we need to lower price as we do. But overall, we think the return profile, given the current pricing looks very good. And part of our business is a wholesale voice business in wholesale and we manage that as a trading desk on an everyday basis. So that's all based on margin. So we really don't care about the top line there. We have guard rails around what margins we want to make on a per minute basis and we manage that like a trading desk.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nick Del Deo with MoffettNathanson.","Nick Del Deo","First, the billing additions you've noted the past two quarters have been pretty substantial. Can you talk about what share of those ads are primarily during my efforts to move off net traffic on net for existing customers versus buildings that you've otherwise targeted? And should we think of this pace as what you can sustain for the next several quarters.","Jeff Storey","First of all, thank you for noticing that they\u2019re substantial because we're working hard at it and I will tell you that we prioritize buildings for off net to on net, we prioritize them for free cash flow. I hate to keep using the same phrase, but it actually offered -- it's the driving factor behind our company and so off net to on net is a guarantee and we know it. Existing sales is another way that we prioritize them. And there's not quite, not all that many that we do build it and they will come type approach. That's very, very rare. So the addressable market or opportunity for us to remain at this pace.","And I can't predict how long, but it's going to be driven by as long as we're finding buildings that we can profitably build into that make us money, we\u2019ll continue to do that and it's not a limiting factor of our ability to turn those buildings up. It's -- the limiting factor over the long term will be what types of returns do we get for each of those buildings and right now we're very pleased with it. So I can't give you a prediction of how long it will last, what I will tell you is that when we look at our capital outlook, we factor in these building ads as well. So as you look at our capital outlook, and you think about it for the year, whether it's long haul, ultra-low loss fiber, whether it\u2019s edge computing expansions, or building ads, that's factored into our capital outlook.","Nick Del Deo","And then, Jeff, you noted in your prepared remarks, your focus on customer satisfaction, kind of along those lines, can you share any details regarding what churn trends have been like in the business?","Jeff Storey","Yeah. So qualitatively, the churn has been pretty good, especially a year after an acquisition, we're pretty pleased with the churn. And that tells us, we didn't do anything wrong in working with our customers. It doesn't say you necessarily did everything right, but it tells you, you didn't do anything wrong. And if you look at our churn across the business, broadband subs and in consumer, although there's seasonality in the second quarter, typically, if you look at year-over-year, second quarter, you know, we're pretty pleased with our overall churn, enterprise, wholesale, wholesale, we've described for a long time to be flat to slightly down, and it's going to continue if the trend is that it is, that's just the nature of that business. But we manage it again, we manage it pretty heavily for margin and for contribution.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer.","Tim Horan","Do you think this is kind of peak revenue decline, year-over-year at this point? Or can you give a little bit more color? I know you gave two line items on revenue decline for the second half of the year. And maybe, obviously, there's a lot of moving parts and you're throwing a lot of money at putting infrastructure in place that leverages a lot of your existing infrastructure was a really, really smart move and de-emphasizing obviously a lot of legacy products that we're talking about, any color on when you can get to break even on revenues. Thanks.","Neel Dev","So I think, Tim, I think the year-over-year gets complicated because of all the noise last year and then if you think back to fourth quarter of last year, we had the noise, but then we also had strength in a lot of non-recurring revenue items that we called out in our fourth quarter earnings call. But in general, I would say, if I look at the first half of this year, compare that to first half of last year, more than a third of the revenue decline is driven by a lot of the actions we took, whether it's prism unprofitable GAM contract, unprofitable government contract, deemphasizing CPE, et cetera. So, like Jeff mentioned earlier, we don't have a lot more left to go. So going forward, the comparisons are going to get more cleaner.","And in terms of trajectory, I think like we said, we feel good about IGAM and enterprise. SMB, the challenge we have is it still has a fair amount of legacy voice. Our sales actually grew sequentially second -- first quarter, second quarter over first quarter. While we need a lot more improvement, which we think we have the addressable market, and we're focused on growing sales. So again, at some point offset some of the legacy declines.","Jeff Storey","And I am very focused and Lisa Miller who runs that business unit is very focused on selling to small and medium businesses in lit buildings outside the legacy CenturyLink footprint. Level 3 never focused there, because that's not the type of customer we focused on. CenturyLink never focused there, because that's not the type of -- we didn't have the network to sell to those customers. And so neither side of the previous companies focused on those. That's a great opportunity for us. We have to stay focused and we have to really drive our opportunities outside of the region for those customers.","Neel Dev","And the one other comment I would add is on the consumer side, if you look at our broadband business, we're investing in that business. We're focused on the competitive asset. Broadband revenues grew year-over-year. This quarter, it grew year-over-year last quarter, and I think it grew year-over-year, all four quarters of last year and there, we're going to continue to focus on that business and also focus on expanding the margin for those business. That business like Jeff mentioned in terms of how we interact with customers, with self-install and the digital interaction, et cetera.","Tim Horan","So maybe just one more question. Sorry. How about on the free cash flow front? Do you think the next couple of -- obviously a lot of moving parts of the business model, but do you think free cash flow can be relatively stable at this run rate over the next three years? Can it grow or should we expect some declines with all the moving parts?","Neel Dev","So look, I think we'll have more to say about next year's free cash flow when we get to that point, but directionally, our objective is to continue to grow EBITDA and we feel good about that. From a capital standpoint, like Jeff mentioned, a lot of these investments that we're making are within the existing envelope. So if you look at our current capital guidance, I think it\u2019s factored in there. In fact, a lot of the fiber deployment spending was last year when we spent only 3.2 billion. So we're going through a massive effort in terms of reorienting in terms of where we spend capital. So we're not spending capital in areas that we don't think we are getting a return and really focused on long life investments. So I think that's all factored into our capital. And if you think about net cash interest with our de-leveraging efforts, and given the interest rate environment, that should improve. So just to give you a flavor for where our free cash flow is at it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Barton with Bank of America.","David Barton","I guess just a couple. Neel, on the mathematics of getting better second half out of enterprise and IGAM, especially for enterprise, it suggests a pretty healthy kind of U-turn in the business and at least the third quarter, if not the fourth. And my guess is that you mentioned a few things that gave you conviction on there. You mentioned sales funnel in particular, I think both of you mentioned it. But I imagine mid third quarter, we've got to be on the install part of that kind of process. And I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate a little bit if the conviction that you're having on the second half being better than the first half is coming from that installation process and the fact that things are actually happening on the ground, especially if there was that 15 million one time or international?","The second question was on the math of the transformation program that, the quarter to quarter change from 1Q to 2Q would suggest we're on track to maybe be at a $600 million run rate by the end of the year. I was wondering if you could kind of elaborate on whether that's realistic and if it is, kind of the pieces parts that will get you there. Thanks.","Neel Dev","Sure, David. So on enterprise, you're right, a big part of that is installs, because like I mentioned, I think, a big sales ramp came up -- came in in March. And then second quarter was a good quarter of sales for enterprise. But given the nature of customers in that segment, some of these deals are large deals, several hundred node network, so it takes a while to get those installs. And so yeah, we need to execute on all the installs. And then there is the sales funnel, which people feel good about, but that will impact more fourth quarter. So the third quarter improvement in revenue will largely be driven by installs.","And similar on the IGAM front as well. And so yeah, the leading indicators were positive about. On the transformation front, we were able to accelerate and -- but I think, for the second half of the year, I would say if you look at our overall guidance of 800 million to 1 billion over three years, with 10 more quarters to go, I will think about it as 50 million to 70 million per quarter is kind of the baseline, but at the end of the day, if we can accelerate, we will, but we're not banking on accelerating.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike McCormack with Guggenheim.","Mike McCormack","Jeff, maybe a quick comment just on the overall fiber capacity. Obviously, a lot of us have moved through the early 2000s with the fiber dot that occurred back then and there were new technologies coming to market, but how do you frame the current sort of capacity situation with respect to the domestic fiber networks?","And then secondly, for Neel, on the leverage side, you obviously still have a lot of EBITDA coming out of legacy revenue streams, just trying to get a sense for how you sort of bifurcate those streams and whether or not it's more accessible to have maybe a higher threshold of leverage, some of the newer stuff and perhaps a little bit lower on the legacy declining revenue streams. Any thoughts around that would be great. Thanks.","Jeff Storey","Yeah. I've not had a fiber glut question in years. So Mike, thanks for bringing that one up. If you think back to 2000, 2002, when there was a glut of fiber, when the glut of fiber, there was a glut of fiber providers. And so we had Level 3 and Quest and [indiscernible] IXC and all these companies going out and building the same assets between the same locations and then they started getting into trouble and when you get into trouble, the next dollar of revenue is leased to another dollar of revenue. So you get irrational pricing, we don't have that today, we don't have a glut of fiber. ","Obviously, we wouldn't be augmenting fiber, if there was a glut in the industry. We don't have a glut of competitors out there. There are a lot of good fiber competitors, a lot of good companies, but for the most part, it's a rational market. And we're building fiber where we need it. I don't worry about a fiber glut. I don't worry about some irrational players selling fiber for ridiculous prices. It's a fairly rational market. It's a competitive market, but it's a fairly rational one. So I'm pretty pleased with where we are. I don't worry about that much. They were painful days for all of us.","Neel Dev","So Mike, I'll take a shot at your question. I'm not sure I completely understand it, but I\u2019ll come back by if I don't address it. So the way we think about it is we are, first of all, we're de-leveraging. So we're -- we feel good about that plan. In terms of all of our investments, they're going -- big chunk of that if you hear our commentary and what we're focused on is really on long life asset, primarily fiber which supports different technologies. And, what we're working on is really transitioning from legacy EBITDA to newer services on that, right. So and that will be an ongoing process. And as an industry, for some of us that have been in this industry for a really long time, we've gone through that transition several times. And so we're managing that at an aggregate level in terms of what leverage makes sense. And we don't really think about it in the piece parts if that makes any sense.","Mike McCormack","Yeah. I guess I was just sort of thinking about as that transition occurs, is that -- not so much obviously this year, but longer term, leverage ratio would have changed that dynamic for you. Obviously, legacy Level 3 was a bit more highly levered.","Neel Dev","Yeah, yes. But for the near term, I think the range we feel good with a 2.75 and 3.25. We feel very comfortable with that. And if we get to a different dynamic, then we'll give it some more thought.","Jeff Storey","Before we finish, I think that was the last question. So before we finish the call, I'd like to wrap up with a few key points. We remain focused on growing adjusted EBITDA and expanding margins. We delivered on those objectives again this quarter, while also focusing on improving the customer and employee experiences. With a solid quarter of sales and a strong funnel, we\u2019re seeing signs of improving revenue performance and expect a better second half of the year for IGAM and enterprise. We continue to evaluate strategic options to create value with our asset portfolio. In the meantime, we're working diligently to operate the business for growth, maximum efficiency and long term return to free cash flow per share. ","We're excited about the investments we're making to continue to enhance and expand our fiber network and to solve our customers\u2019 evolving networking needs like edge computing. We continue to make progress toward our de-leveraging objectives and expect to meet our leverage target within our three year timeframe. And finally, before I conclude the call, I'll remind you that as always, our guiding principle is growing free cash flow per share. Every action we take and every option we review is in the context of that metric. Thank you all for joining today's call and for your continued support of CenturyLink. France, that concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using CenturyLink\u2019s conferencing service today.

Please, go ahead. ","Valerie Finberg","Thank you, France. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us for the CenturyLink fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining me on the call today are Jeff Storey, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Neel Dev, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I'd like to call your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two of our 4Q 2019 presentation, which notes that this conference call may include forward-looking statements, subject to certain risks and uncertainties. In addition, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to the most comparable GAAP measures. Those reconciliations can be found in the earnings press release or the supplemental schedules on the CenturyLink website.","Additionally, please note that certain metrics discussed on the call today exclude transformation costs and other special items, as noted in our earnings materials.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

Neel will provide an overview of our financial results and then we'll go into your questions.","We made good progress in 2019, transforming and positioning our business for the future, while also delivering on our near-term objectives and meeting the guidance targets we provided at the beginning of the year. As I look back over the past two years, since the close of the Level 3 transaction, simply put, we've done exactly what we said we were going to do.","As you can see on slide four, in 2018 and 2019, we met or exceeded all of the outlook measures we provided. We delivered two consecutive years of growth in adjusted EBITDA and two years of expanding margins. We also exceeded our integration synergy targets in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the deleveraging and transformation cost savings targets we shared with you in 2019.","We have significantly ramped our free cash flow from premerger levels. Last year, as we said we would, we grew Enterprise and IGAM revenue in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019. We still have a lot of work ahead, but I'm proud of the work our team has done and we will remain focused and financially disciplined, as we continue to drive our transformation.","You've heard me say many times that our focus is on driving growth in both profitable revenue and free cash flow per share. Our strategy is fairly straightforward and our 2019 capital investment program focused on three primary areas: enhancing our product capabilities, to meet the changing technology needs of our customers and the digital interactions they seek; increasing the size of our addressable market, by continually expanding our fiber footprint; and improving our customer experience and reducing our cost to operate, through simplification and automation.","I'm pleased with the progress across all of these dimensions. As an example of expanding our addressable market in 2019, we've built fiber to approximately 18,000 additional enterprise buildings, bringing our total count to around 170,000 fiber-fed on-net locations. We've prioritized fiber deployment for consumers, over previous investments in copper-based technologies like bonding and vectoring. We now have enabled more than 2 million fiber households, a number we expect to continue to grow.","And we're making it easier for our consumer customers to access these networks by standardizing our product set and enabling a digital environment. That digital environment allows customers to immediately initiate service using automated and seamless provisioning processes.","In turn, this lowers our cost to operate and improves our customer experience. This type of transformation creates a virtuous cycle. We optimize our capabilities to reduce costs, which drives a better customer experience and happy customers buy more and churn less.","Beyond our capital investments, we continue to take steps to improve the profitability of CenturyLink's base business. We are slowly eliminating our linear video products and shut down initiatives to create a streaming video product. We continue to groom our enterprise customer base to identify and exit low margin contracts. We have deemphasized low margin CPE sales. We still sell CPE but only in the context of larger network-centric and professional services deals.","These moves obviously have a negative effect on revenue but have a positive effect on free cash flow generation. We believe the majority of this low-quality revenue grooming is now behind us but we remain disciplined with our focus on profitable revenue growth. We're also very active in grooming low-margin off-net circuits onto our own fiber facilities. This is a long slow process though.","From a pure cost perspective, we achieved $850 million in run rate integration synergies in 2018 and are well on our way to achieving the $800 million to $1 billion in transformation efficiencies we announced in 2019. We will continue to streamline our operating model and believe we have significant opportunities to continue to transform CenturyLink in the future.","I'd like to cover one last highlight from 2019, before I discuss 2020. Turning to Slide 5. At the beginning of last year, we modified our capital allocation strategy to focus on three priorities: Increased capital spending to drive growth in the business. As examples, the addition of the 18,000 new on-net buildings I mentioned, brings more customers locations on-net and gives us a strategic advantage and a better customer experience.","Investment in our Edge capabilities, coupled with our deep and extensive fiber network places us at the forefront of the low latency, high transmission rate world of edge computing. Upgrading our global network with the largest deployment of ultra-low loss fiber positions us well to continue winning in the long-haul fiber market, especially with hyperscale customers. Expanding our consumer fiber footprint enables growth in our high-speed broadband offerings.","And lastly as I just discussed, we believe investing in the transformation of our quote-to-cash platforms, not only drives operating efficiencies but also improves our customer experience and support our revenue growth initiatives across all of our customer segments.","Our second objective was to reduce leverage with a target of 2.75 to 3.25 times over three years. We reduced debt in 2019 by a little more than $2 billion. In addition to leverage reduction we're taking advantage of our improved balance sheet and strong capital markets to lower our cost of capital and reduce interest rate risk. Neel will provide additional detail, but I'm very pleased with this work and believe it should drive improved equity value over time.","Finally, we believe our dividend is a key part of our value proposition and we returned more than $1 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2019. We remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. And in 2020, you can expect to see us continue to invest in the business for growth and further reducing leverage. Our dividend policy is unchanged; giving us what we believe is a very manageable payout ratio in the 30s.","Turning to 2020 on slide 6, I'll discuss our 2020 priorities. You'll notice they look a lot like our 2019 priorities, which by the way is what discipline to a plan looks like. First, we want to continue to transform our operations to improve both the employee experience and the customer experience. Second, we want to continue to invest in growth through fiber deployment and enablement of fiber related products and services such as embedded security, dynamic connections, cloud application management and edge computing. Third, grow adjusted EBITDA through ongoing improvements in sales, operational efficiency and financial discipline; and fourth, continue to progress toward our 2.75 to 3.25 leverage target. Neel will cover the details of our financial outlook for 2020.","As we look to 2020 and beyond, we expect our revenue trajectory to continue to improve. While we do not expect these improvements to be linear, we do expect better performance over the course of the year and we will remain disciplined in our pursuit of profitable revenue.","As you know, we don't provide a forward-looking outlook for revenue, but we understand the importance of growing revenue and we are very focused on that as a key objective. I'll briefly walk through commentary for each of our business groups.","I'll start with iGAM. As a reminder, our International and Global Accounts Business encompasses our operations in LatAm, EMEA and APAC, as well as our global accounts team, which serves a little more than 200 customers, customers primarily based in North America that operate on a global scale. These 200 customers aren't necessarily our largest customers by revenue, but their needs match our global capabilities and they represent opportunities for growth. The iGAM business showed improvement in the second half of 2019 and we believe we can leverage our investments and market position to drive continuing improvement.","Moving to our Enterprise segment, which includes both large and regional enterprises generally for companies with more than 500 employees, as well as our public sector group that includes all domestic federal, state, local and research and education customers.","In addition to our ubiquitous fiber network, I've long been a believer that operating locally is a key differentiator. Our local market strategy leverages about 25 teams of general managers, account managers, sales engineers and sales support that are locally positioned in key markets across the country.","These local teams work directly with and know our customers and their markets. As many of our competitors have pulled back from a local model, we continue to lean into it creating what we believe is a distinct advantage for CenturyLink. This locally focused, customer centered model together with our far reaching fiber network and the ability and willingness to effectively deploy capital to meet our customers' communications challenges are leading an increasing number of customers to select CenturyLink.","For example, the Texas Rangers announced in 2017 that they were planning to build a new enclosed ballpark to be ready for the 2020 baseball season, a ballpark that would require a new technology design to meet the needs of the team and the fans. They were focused on creating a one-of-a-kind experience for everyone at their home baseball games and additional events they hold throughout the year.","The Rangers selected CenturyLink to support their smart stadium vision, based on our multiple product capabilities, including our smart venue offering, professional services and hybrid networking portfolio, all riding over CenturyLink's diverse fiber connectivity into the stadium.","Looking specifically at the public sector portion of our Enterprise segment highlights, what I see as, one of the key benefits of the combination of CenturyLink and Level 3. While both companies had a share of the federal business, we are seeing that the combined networks together with our hybrid networking and other capabilities have made us more competitive and are enabling us to win more new business than either company was able to do on its own. And if I may brag a bit, I also believe we have the best federal team in the business.","I'll give you a few points that illustrate our growing success. After being selected as the first telecommunications provider to be awarded the authority to operate under the new EIS program, CenturyLink was then awarded the very first contract under EIS to provide core network services for NASA. We also recently announced a significant win with the Department of the Interior with a task order worth up to $1.6 billion over an 11-year period, which is even more significant as the DOI business was previously provided by a competitor.","We've also recently announced wins with the Social Security Administration, the Department of Defense Education Activity Network and the Census Bureau. We are excited about these wins and we will continue to pursue growth in the public sector space, although, I do want to caution that government contracts generally take several years to ramp.","Our success with the federal government demonstrates what a skilled sales and support organization can do with a world-class network and leading-edge products. As with the various government entities, we are bringing the same capabilities to our Enterprise and IGAM customers.","Turning to SMB. We continue to see mixed results from this segment, as revenue pressures from legacy services is far more than offsetting growth from new services and our expandable addressable market. However, we believe we can ultimately grow this segment and are investing in the products and platforms that are aligned to the unique needs of these customers.","Our aim is to bring these customers the power of our network, security and other related services, by enabling platforms that support high volume, frictionless transactions and make it easier and more efficient for these customers to access our capabilities. You can expect to see us continue to invest in fiber to multi-tenant environment and focus on taking share where those investments are made.","To complement this investment and the ongoing simplification of our SMB operating model, we are streamlining, while at the same time, enhancing our product portfolio to enable solutions tailored for the small and medium business market. This includes products like Unified Communications as a Service, embedded security and simplified LAN offerings, all that are seamlessly delivered and scalable based on the individual customers' needs. As I said, we're not yet where we expect to be in the SMB segment, but I am optimistic about our ability to improve performance over time.","Our outlook for the Wholesale segment is largely unchanged and we continue to expect revenue to decline, primarily driven by ongoing industry consolidation and technology evolution. However, technology evolution also gives us opportunities and we are working closely with our wholesale customers to support their 5G initiatives as our expanding fiber footprint is a natural match for their needs.","Within the Consumer business, 2019 was somewhat of a transitional year that highlighted two areas of focus: To focus on fiber as the premier last-mile access solution outside of our CAF II market; and the ramp down in our linear TV product. We believe our strategy to invest in fiber is paying off.","Broadband revenue grew year-over-year each and every quarter in 2019. While we've seen declines in our low-speed broadband subscribers, we've seen great results with our high-speed subscribers. From the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2019, we doubled the number of subscribers with speeds of 100 megabits or higher and nearly tripled the number of subscribers with one gig and higher.","We believe the reason for this growth is the simple fact that Fiber-to-the-Home not hybrid fiber coax, not wireless, not even 5G but fiber delivers the best experience for customers and is the most scalable for future services. As we all know from our own personal experience consistent, resilient, high bandwidth connections are essential to today's consumers. Plainly put, while fiber isn't a practical solution in all markets or all neighborhoods, we take share where we invest in fiber directly to the home.","We will continue to invest in our Consumer business, centered around three primary initiatives: Extending our fiber footprint in areas that make economic sense and ensuring we grow where we invest; improving our systems tools and capabilities to create a simpler digital experience for our customers and to drive efficiencies to maximize cash flow from the declining parts of the business; and completing the CAF II build out.","In addition, we like the framework we've seen over the last few weeks with the RDOF program and believe the FCC has done an excellent job in designing a program to enable access to underserved areas. We believe RDOF is a natural fit with CenturyLink's network and the robust fiber network capillarity from our CAF II position. We will pursue participation in RDOF, where the economics make sense for us.","While we remain an enterprise-centric company, we see clear value in what the Consumer business contributes to CenturyLink, by growing where we invest, driving efficiencies into our operating model and maximizing the contribution from the declining parts of consumer, we believe we can effectively manage EBITDA and cash flow contributions from this business.","And I'd also like to update you on a couple of other consumer-related items. First, you may have seen several announcements at the end of 2019 of settlements with various attorneys general regarding the consumer billing practices lawsuits. As of last week, we've reached settlements with AGs in five states.","In the fourth quarter, we took a $50 million charge for consumer-related AG and litigation matters. We continue to maintain our marketing and billing practices. We're properly disclosed and consistent with widely used industry practices but we also saw the benefit of settling these cases to enable us to focus on continuing to improve the business. We still have some ongoing litigation related to the consumer business but we've made significant steps towards putting these matters behind us.","I'd also like to give you an update on our strategic review of the Consumer business. During our review, we had no preconceived notions or predetermined outcomes in mind. There were no sacred cows. Our goal was to scrutinize the business unit and determine how we could maximize shareholder value over the long-term.","To that end, we have engaged with parties that are interested in exploring the purchase of all or parts of the business. We also took a look at what we could do -- be doing better internally to drive additional value.","In this aspect, we confirmed several things we already knew. First, we can continue to improve efficiency in the business. By simplifying our product offers and moving to a more digital experience we believe, we can improve efficiency as legacy revenues decline.","Second, we can more effectively penetrate our fiber fed areas. We still have opportunities within our existing fiber footprint to drive higher penetration rates and are implementing new initiatives to do so.","Third, that we should continue to expand our addressable market through further fiber deployment. We win where we invest in fiber fed neighborhoods. Fiber is a superior solution and we have demonstrated the ability to take share where we invest.","As I mentioned, we are focusing on fiber as our preferred access solution in the consumer broadband market. We remain open to all value-enhancing opportunities and continue to engage with parties interested in transactions or partnership opportunities as we always would. But our focus right now is to continue to expand our fiber footprint, improve the operating model and extract costs from the business, which creates the best long-term value for the company and for our shareholders under any scenario.","I will tell you that the team here sees the value in our network, platforms, products and our approach to customers and we are excited about 2020. We hear from our customers that our willingness to invest, our differentiated service experience and our solutions capabilities make a difference in their ability to achieve their goals for 2020 and beyond.","We continue to invest in our fiber network to drive greater revenue from our existing fiber infrastructure and invest in simplification and automation of our business both to take out costs and to improve the customer experience. As we execute on that strategy, we believe we will drive sustainable long-term growth and free cash flow per share.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Neel to provide an update on our detailed financial results and the outlook for 2020. Neel?","Neel Dev","Thank you, Jeff, and good afternoon, everyone. Before we get into the details of the fourth quarter, I wanted to provide a brief overview of our financial performance for the year, which can be found on slide 7. 2019 was a solid year for CenturyLink. We met all our financial outlook metrics, specifically adjusted EBITDA of $9.070 billion and free cash flow of $3.276 billion.","For the full year 2019, we expanded our adjusted EBITDA margin to 40.5%, compared to 38.6% for full year 2018, which represents a more than 500 basis point improvement since the Level 3 transaction.","Over the course of 2019 through a series of capital market transactions, we reduced net debt by approximately $2 billion delevering to 3.7 times this quarter from four times for the same period last year and 4.3 times at the close of the Level 3 transaction.","Over the last 12 months, we have also refinanced approximately $17 billion in long-term debt, reducing interest expense and extending maturities. And for the full year 2019, we achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings.","Moving to revenue. For the full year 2019, total revenue declined 4.4% to $22.4 billion. If you look at the year-over-year revenue decline for 2019, we estimate that about 25% to 30% of that decline was driven by actions we took to focus on profitable revenue in the failed sales leaseback accounting change that we described on our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call.","Turning to slide eight. Total revenue in the fourth quarter declined 3.6% to $5.57 billion. This compares to declines of 3.6% in the third quarter, 5.5% in the second quarter and 5% in the first quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we highlighted that we had about $40 million in non-recurring revenue benefit. USF is up about the same amount this year compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","So as you look at the year-over-year percentage change, it is representative of the underlying business. Sequentially, total revenue decreased 0.6%, compared to an increase of 0.5% in the third quarter and a decline of 1.2% in the second quarter. Also, please keep in mind, the fourth quarter is typically stronger from a seasonality perspective, while the first quarter is when we usually see contract rerates, primarily for our largest customers. We also expect a decrease in USF rates by approximately 15% in the first quarter of 2020 relative to the rates in the fourth quarter of 2019. As a reminder, this is pass-through revenue we collect for the FCC.","Moving now to our business segments. On a year-over-year basis, international and global accounts or IGAM revenue decreased 2.1%. On a constant currency basis IGAM declined 1.1%. On a sequential basis IGAM grew 0.6% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. Moving to our Enterprise segment.","On both a year-over-year and sequential basis, Enterprise revenue was roughly flat. We achieved our objective of improving the revenue trajectory for IGAM and Enterprise. Currency was a headwind, but adjusting for currency, which primarily impacts IGAM, and excluding USF, both IGAM and Enterprise grew revenue for the second half of the year compared to the first half.","SMB revenue decreased 3.3% year-over-year. This compares to our third quarter 2019 year-over-year decline of 6.5%. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.4% compared to a decline of 0.3% last quarter. Wholesale revenue decreased 7.4% year-over-year. Sequentially we saw a decline of 3% compared to an increase of 0.7% last quarter.","As a reminder, we had a benefit of $15 million from a carrier settlement in the third quarter of 2019. Excluding that carrier settlement, Wholesale would have declined 1.6% sequentially in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Consumer on Slide 9. For the fourth quarter of 2019, revenue declined 5.5% year-over-year. Sequentially, revenue declined 0.9%, which compares to declines of 1.3% in the third quarter, 1.7% in the second quarter and 1.8% in the first quarter. Broadband revenue for the fourth quarter 2019 grew 2.1% year-over-year, which compares to growth of 2.3% last quarter. In the fourth quarter we saw a net loss of 36,000 total broadband subs. In speeds of 100 meg and above, we added 53,000 subs.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. For the fourth quarter 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $2.278 billion compared to $2.301 billion from the year-ago quarter. For the full year 2019, adjusted EBITDA was $9.070 billion, which compares to $9.040 billion for 2018. Despite more than $1 billion in revenue loss year-over-year, we achieved our objective of growing full year adjusted EBITDA, focusing on profitable revenue and our cost transformation efforts.","For the fourth quarter 2019, capital expenditures were $940 million. For 2019, capital expenditures were $3.628 billion. We ramped up our CapEx spend by more than $450 million relative to 2018, as we focused on improving revenue trajectory. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the company generated free cash flow of $1.022 billion. For the full year 2019, we generated free cash flow of $3.276 billion.","Turning to capital markets activity on Slide 11. On our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call, we outlined a three-year plan to get to a target range of 2.75 to 3.25 times net debt to adjusted EBITDA. Over the course of 2019, we have been very active in the capital markets. And through a series of transactions, we decreased net debt by approximately $2 billion.","Additionally, since announcing our deleveraging plan last February, we have refinanced $17 billion or roughly half our debt. Our improved credit profile and constructive market conditions have enabled us to reduce interest expense and extend maturities.","Turning to our maturity profile on Slide 12. At the end of 2018 for the five-year period from 2020 through 2025, we had approximately $26 billion of debt maturing. As a result of our deleveraging and refinancing activities, we have reduced maturities by over $12 billion for the same period. For the full year 2020, we expect net cash interest expense in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.8 billion. The midpoint of this range implies net cash interest expense savings of more than $200 million compared to 2019 and more than $350 million compared to 2018. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio is now at 3.7 times and we remain highly focused on getting to our 2.75 to 3. 25 net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage target.","As the end of the fourth quarter, we have achieved approximately $430 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA transformation savings. These savings are part of our three-year transformation plan that we outlined last year. Overall, we continue to expect to achieve the $800 million to $1 billion in annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA savings. Integration and transformation costs and special items incurred in the fourth quarter 2019 impacted adjusted EBITDA by $173 million and free cash flow by $33 million.","Turning to slide 13 and our outlook for the full year 2020. Please note, all outlook measures exclude integration and transformation expenses. For the full year 2020, we expect adjusted EBITDA of $9 billion to $9.2 billion and free cash flow of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. We expect capital expenditures in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion. The slight increase in our outlook relative to last year is primarily driven by increased fiber deployments for our enterprise, federal and consumer customers.","In terms of notable items on working capital, we expect cash payments for other post-employment benefits or OPEB of approximately $200 million. As a reminder, our fourth quarter has typically high working capital use, driven by timing of bonus payments and other prepaid expenses.","Also important to note, our free cash flow guidance does not include any discretionary contributions to the pension fund. For 2020, we do not have any required contributions.","In summary, we concluded 2019 with strong execution on several fronts. We improved the revenue trajectory for the overall business. We delivered on EBITDA growth and margin expansion as we successfully balanced investing in our growth products, investing in customer experience and appropriately harvesting our declining products.","In addition to interest expense savings, our deleveraging activities and capital market transactions significantly strengthened our balance sheet. With our continued investments in the business, our focus on profitable growth and ongoing cost transformation initiatives, we are well-positioned for 2020.","With that I'll hand it back over to Jeff.","Jeff Storey","Thanks Neel. It's time to open it up for questions. France, would you explain the process?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Going to our first question from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. ","Alexis Roper","Hi. This is Alexis Roper on for Simon. I wanted to ask, could you talk a little bit about the impacts from the large contract wins you've been announcing and how they're expected to kind of ramp over time?","Jeff Storey","Yeah. In the terms, but your last part of the question is exactly right. They ramp over time, especially with the federal government. These are -- we're awarded multiyear contracts that anticipate future services. We get an overall task order for that. But then we receive individual orders along the way and we'll get them spread out over time and they'll turn up over time. Some of the things are more urgent. So, for example, on the 2020 census that has a time line associated with it. But, in general, they ramp just over a fair amount of time. ","Alexis Roper","Great. And if I could ask another question. Could you talk a little bit about churn risk or opportunities from the pending wireless merger or potential DISH network build? ","Jeff Storey","Sure. If DISH network builds out, then we look at that as a great opportunity for us to go win a new customer and help them in support of their 5G rollout or their broadband network wireless rollout. If you look at T-Mobile and Sprint, if that ultimately goes through, which, it looks like it will, but if it all goes through we have great relationships with both companies. We're a key provider to them in both companies.","There's always upside and downside. And their expansion into 5G and expansion into other markets represents an upside, but we'll have to just look at it over time. We've gotten really good at industry consolidation and winning business with our wholesale partners as they go out and buy other companies. And so, we just look at it as an opportunity to define where we're the right solution for those providers.","Neel Dev","And just to add to the contract question, I think, just to provide a little bit of additional color. These contracts usually have a very long tail. So from a return perspective, we've seen they're very good for us, but it takes a while to ramp. So if you think about the contracts in 2020, the impact will be, from a revenue perspective, will be in the low tens of millions in year-one of these contracts.","Alexis Roper","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Tim Horan","Thanks, guys and congratulations on a great year. Can you talk a little bit about the booking trends and a little color around that? And maybe related to that, just the demand for fiber, broadly speaking. We're seeing some incredible build outs by a lot of these hyperscale companies and others. Are you able to leverage a lot of your existing fiber with some of the demand out there and same for existing conduits or any other infrastructure you have? Thanks.","Jeff Storey","Yeah. I'll take the second half of the question first. We see great demand for our fiber-based services. Part of the reason that led us to invest in the ultra-low loss overbuild is demand from hyperscalers and others who need really, really high capacities over the fiber and where traditional fibers just couldn't do it as efficiently as the new low loss fiber. And so we continue to work with them and to partner within them in network builds but also providing them solutions. And we think that's a great part of our business. From a conduit perspective, we sell conduit from time-to-time or least conduit from time-to-time but it's not a big part of the overall business.","Neel Dev","And on the \u2013 on your question Tim, on the booking trends. Fourth quarter overall was the best sales quarter for us this year, largely driven by iGAM and Enterprise. But I also do want to caution, usually fourth quarter tends to be a light quarter for sales but this quarter was a very good quarter of sales but driven by more complex larger deals, which take a while to install. So we're not going to see the benefit in the first quarter but more so coming in in the second, third and fourth quarter of this year.","Tim Horan","And are you seeing a competitive intensity in enterprise increase or decrease or any change in competitive intensity?","Jeff Storey","No. We've got great competitors out there that work really hard to provide for the customers. We think we have a better solution. And we think we execute better. We think our local model for enterprise customers is really a key differentiator for us. We think our high-touch model for iGAM customers and our global footprint is really a differentiator for us. But ultimately, we've got strong competitors and the competitive intensity is high every day. It's up to us to execute. And I haven't seen anybody that if we execute well that beats us. So it's really us that matters. Our performance is what determines success or not.","Tim Horan","Thank you.","Jeff Storey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi","Great. Thank you. Couple of questions. First you talked about potential impact of rerating customers in the first quarter. Is that on the Wholesale side? Or is there some component on the Enterprise? Is there a way of quantifying potentially that impact?","And second, can you talk about what your guidance assumes in terms of incremental synergy achievement this year? And then maybe finally, cash taxes have remained really low. When do you expect that to ramp?","Jeff Storey","Neel?","Neel Dev","I was just making sure I get all parts of that. So Batya on the rerate, that was just a general statement in terms of seasonality. We see that every year, fourth quarter tends to be strong and then first quarter we do have some pressures from rerates from our larger customers. So primarily, it's not just wholesale but also iGAM and the top end of enterprise, so there are just some seasonal weakness in the first quarter.","In terms of your question on savings I think linear is still a good assumption. We achieved $430 million. And we're still good with the $800 million to $1 billion over three years. We're going to be very milestone based. We have good line of sight and that's all factored into our EBITDA guidance range. In terms of cash taxes, we do have offsets there and it's been running lower than $100 million. And as we look at our NOLs, we're good for the next few years.","Batya Levi","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Philip Cusick","Hey, guys. Thanks. Jeff that was helpful on the consumer side. Can we assume that your strategic view is sort of over? And can you expand on the potential to as you said sell or partner for parts of the business? It sounds like you engaged, but is the focus now more internal? Or do those discussions continue? Thanks.","Jeff Storey","No. Thank you, Phil. The discussions are continuing. But the strategic review is over. And the strategic review says here's how we should be investing in the business and here's how -- where we should be harvesting and all of those types of things. And regardless of whatever scenario, whether we maintain it all as a part of CenturyLink, we sell part of it or we partner with somebody those things that we're doing now drives the best long-term shareholder value regardless of whatever scenario works out. And so those are the things that we are focused on.","So I would say that the strategic review is over, but we are continuing and actively engaged with partners and parties that might be interested in the transaction and we'll continue to stay engaged with them and figure out if there's some another way to create additional shareholder value.","Philip Cusick","Okay. And can you help us quantify the current count of home fiber broadband available? And how big you think that could be in your footprint? And anything you can do to reduce the cost of deploying that to homes over time?","Jeff Storey","Yeah. So I think we have about two million fiber homes activated today, fiber addressable homes today. We continue to expand that and we'll continue to expand it in the coming years.","I don't have a specific number for how big that can be, but we're not nearing the cap of it. We've got a lot of room to continue to grow. And even within that two million homes, we've got a lot of room to grow our penetration rate. We think we can do a much better job of driving the penetration rate within that two million homes. We think we can expand the addressable market by building out to more homes pretty aggressively over the coming years. And we don't see any near-term cap in our ability to expand our addressable footprint. So Neel do you want to add?","Neel Dev","Yeah. So I think just the only thing I'd highlight is Phil, a big part in call it 20%, 25% of that footprint, we added over the last 18 months to a couple of years or so. And so part of the reason the penetration there is still ramping and we like the penetration ramp is because some of that is relatively new deployment. And so we still see a lot of opportunity in terms of adding homes with our micro targeting strategy where the cost is low and they look good from a return perspective. ","Jeff Storey","And if you think about it, I mean doubling our 100 meg subscribers in the -- over the course of the last year and almost tripling our one gig subscribers. Our consumer team is doing a good job at figuring out how to -- where do we build fiber and how do we communicate with our customers in a way to give them the products and services that they want. And so they're -- we're only going to get better at that. And they've got a lot of initiatives to drive the penetration rates up.","Philip Cusick","And if I can -- sorry and I know I'm taking a lot here, but I'm getting some questions coming in. Can you just help us with the types of conversations you're having? I mean, are there books out on your consumer business all or part of it? Or is this, sort of, gradual conversations that may or may not develop over time that we shouldn't think are an urgency behind them?","Jeff Storey","We've been very transparent with a number of parties. We've worked closely with them. We have -- of course, have NDAs and other things in place, so I'm not going to name names, but we have worked very closely to give people true insight to our consumer business, so that they can evaluate, if there are opportunities for us to partner together or to do a transaction.","The character of those transactions are all across the board and the types of companies that we've talked to are a little bit across the board too. So whether it's a look at a particular state or look at all of the consumer business, or some sort of joint venture, I mean, we're open to all of those various things.","Philip Cusick","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question from the line of David Barden with Bank of America. Please proceed.","David Barden","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, the first one, Neel, just as we kind of look at the cash flow guidance range. It seems like there's some nice tailwinds from interest savings, tailwinds from maybe a pension contribution savings. So, I guess, I wonder, is the high and the low end, is the difference there the CapEx spending, given that the midpoint of the guidance is kind of pretty much consistent at EBITDA with what we did in 2019? I guess, kind of, where are we -- what will land us in the higher or lower ends of those ranges and the moving parts there would be helpful.","And then, just the second piece on the consumer broadband side, the -- could you kind of talk a little bit about the ARPU difference between the lower speed that you're losing and the higher speeds that you're gaining? And how the cadence of price hikes will kind of feather in over the course of 2020? Thanks.","Neel Dev","So, David, I think on your guidance range for cash flow, I'll try to see if I can simplify that. I think its capital and working capital. So if you start with EBITDA, less CapEx, net cash interest and our guidance for cash taxes and kind of do the math on the implied working capital, it's roughly $200 million. And -- which is largely our OPEB cash spend, which is in addition to what kind of flows through EBITDA. So that's the $200 million use of working capital.","And if you think about our trade working capital, DSOs and DPOs, just a day difference there could swing working capital by $100 million or so. And then there is capital, in general. So it's not perfect, but that's kind of the rough math in terms of the working capital -- the overall free cash flow range.","David Barden","Got it.","Jeff Storey","And on ARPU.","Neel Dev","In terms of ARPU, I think, in general, as we are moving customers up from a bandwidth standpoint, especially into gig services, the ARPU is significantly higher. And so, that is something that we are continuing to work on. And the churn rates are better. So that's going to be an ongoing effort for us. ","David Barden","Okay. Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Nick Del Deo with the MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Nick Del Deo","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. To what degree is your higher expected CapEx in the coming year helping to lower your OpEx? And on the flip side, do any of the initiatives you're undertaking like Edge come with a measurable OpEx drag?","Jeff Storey","Yes. So, first of all, I appreciate the fact that -- I mean, the question is, it hits right to the point. We do invest capital to reduce OpEx. That is a significant part of our strategy. We invest capital to ultimately drive free cash flow per share, but on a remediate basis improve EBITDA. And so whether that comes from revenue or comes from operational efficiencies, we think that's a really good use of our capital. I don't have an exact percentage but there is a fair amount that we use to drive the operational efficiencies, the digitalization of our business, the tools and the processes that we use with our customers to drive out costs and drive up the customer experience.","Yes typically, Nick I think like Jeff has mentioned several times I think when we invest it's a combination of improving margin and also driving revenue. So just give you a simple example like when you're adding buildings to the network, there is off-net on-net savings that we're saving in terms of network expense and then there's other savings in terms of operation side and how we can troubleshoot, et cetera. So there's a long list of things that drives efficiencies from our capital investment, similarly on the back-office systems and processes as well.","Nick Del Deo","But I wouldn't \u2013 on the flip side, do any of your initiatives come with a measurable upfront OpEx drag?","Jeff Storey","Yes, I mean they do. There's nothing that is a massive OpEx drag. But there is. If you're going to launch a business like Edge computing, you're going to have OpEx that pre-runs revenue. And so yes there is some. It's not material to our business. I don't see it as a major overhang on this or something that we have to work really hard to overcome. But you're certainly right that there is operational costs that sometimes advanced revenues.","Nick Del Deo","Okay. And then Jeff you've described the vision for the SMB platform as being high-volume and frictionless, I think the words you used. How far away are you from having that platform sort of in place and generating new business?","Jeff Storey","We're getting closer every day, which is maybe not a very fulfilling answer. But it's a complicated thing. So let me tell you some of the stuff that we're doing that indicates that we're getting there. We're adding new buildings continually and those new buildings give us an addressable market with those customers that make it possible for us to sell to them in the first place off-net, not being a very good solution for that type of business, on-net really driving it. So we're doing that.","We're also deploying equipment in those buildings that make it easy for our operations team to turn up services on a very quick basis because that's what we think we need in that \u2013 for those types of customers. Then we're also introducing products like UCaaS and we are very actively rolling out SD-WAN. We're active with various different platforms. We're actively rolling out UCaaS and making sure that we have the products and services. All of those things go into the digital environment that we're looking for.","We're also updating our back office support so to speak. I want to be more front office than back office. Some of those take a little bit longer but we have a number of initiatives that we think are going to help us drive the growth out of that business and really create an environment and a product set that meet the needs of those customers.","Nick Del Deo","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Jeff Storey","Sure.","Operator","Our next question from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. So you've had a couple of quarters here. You talked about this earlier, a very strong bookings in the enterprise segment it sounds like 4Q was so strong. We probably should not be run rating that into the early part of this year. When we speak to investors about your business, they seem to think of you as selling into a very hard end market with some secular precedent. So I was hoping you can maybe just give us a little more context around, why the bookings have improved? How much of that is, is stuff you think you're doing right? Maybe how much of it is a misunderstanding of the growth opportunities available to your enterprise business in this market? And maybe just some general context around the extent, to which you think some of this, is durable even if we're not necessarily extrapolating the 4Q performance? Thank you.","Jeff Storey","Yeah. So let me talk about why I think we win and I got a list of things that go into it, it's not one thing that causes us to win. But it starts with -- we have what I believe is the world's best fiber network. We're increasing our connectivity in the on-net locations every single day. We are connected with every cloud provider across the U.S. but really across the world. And we have great connectivity into them.","We're creating solutions that allow our customers to manage their infrastructure more efficiently, things like dynamic connections where they can scale bandwidth up and down redirect it from one provider to another, from one cloud provider to another cloud provider if they want, things like cloud application management where they can look a layer higher and look at their cloud applications and how are they running.","And so I think it starts with the connectivity, the fiber base, the high speed, the low-latency connectivity, coupled with embedded security to make it a reliable and safe environment for them, coupled with our network-related services to make it easier for our customers to manage, coupled with a great team.","And I talked about our federal team and how great I think they are. But we also have great enterprise and GAM teams in small and medium business teams. We have a great team going out and driving the success. So I think that our success over time in the short-term and in the long-term comes down to our ability to leverage our network with great products and make sure that we're positioning them in front of our customers properly through great sales and we're executing on delivering them through a great operations group. And so I think it comes down to we win, if we execute with the network and the services we have.","Brett Feldman","Thanks. Just as follow-up, so do you think that the end market opportunity would allow you if you keep executing this way to continue to grow your bookings? I think that's the debate a lot of investors have is it a growing pie? Is it a shrinking pie? Are you just taking a bigger part of it?","Jeff Storey","I understand the reason for the confusion, because it is a growing pie in some parts and a shrinking pie in other parts. And sometimes we get so focused on the shrinking pie, we're not paying attention to the growing pie. And that's what I think we also do differently. One of the reasons I think that we're in a better position as we are one thing. We are a fiber provider. We are mostly enterprise focused, but we are a fiber provider. And so we look at how do we leverage all of those capabilities.","So for us, I think that yes we have parts of our business that are declining. But we face the truth on those. We recognize them for what they are. We manage them for contribution while we have them and we lean into the growth of the things that we think will grow like Edge compute, like the other cloud capabilities that I've talked about, like pure bandwidth and transmission rates that are going to continue to go up. And so, I think the -- I get the reason the confusion. It's a complicated business. But, overall, I see better opportunities than that.","Neel Dev","And, Brett, I think one of the things to add to that. I think, it's -- Jeff kind of mentioned it several times. I think, if you think about everything we see in terms of emerging trends, it's all about more bandwidth and less latency. And that makes fiber more and more valuable. And I think what clouds the picture, like Jeff said, are the legacy services.","So all the fiber-based services are growing. And the other thing that we do is, we have a lot of focus. So compared to a lot of our larger competitors that have \u2013 are not as focused on the enterprise business like we are and we are investing in our customers and we're building out to a lot of their locations and enabling the transitions. ","Jeff Storey","And if you \u2013 when an investor asks you that, ask them about their business and do they need more bandwidth or less bandwidth over time. Do they need more locations or fewer locations over time? Do they need more control of their applications or less control of their applications? They need more security or less security? If you think about the fundamental trends that drive our customers, they are good for us and we see opportunities across all of those.","Brett Feldman","Appreciate the color. Thank you.","Jeff Storey","Sure. Thank you, Brett. And France, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Very well. Our last question is from the line of Michael McCormack with Guggenheim. Please proceed.","Michael McCormack","Hi, guys. Thanks. Maybe just a quick comment on the CapEx guidance. What's driving the variance there? What would cause you to be at one end or the other of it? And then, secondly, I guess, on the consumer business. Will there be any incentives to roll fiber faster to some of those areas where you're seeing the most loss on the ISP data set? Thanks.","Neel Dev","So, generally, our approach is very success-based. And so, that's one of the reasons for the range. So we want to make sure that if we're deploying fiber, we're deploying capacity, we're keeping up with the penetration and selling into those buildings before we deploy more. So that's one of the drivers, just keeping the capital more aligned with revenue performance. And then the two, overall, driver is really investing in more fiber in both in enterprise and consumer.","Jeff Storey","And then on the -- are there things that drive us into one area more than another. Yes, there are. It's a complicated formula, so to speak. But it includes things like, how much does it cost us to build, what's the permitting time frame, what are the customer penetrations, what types of customers do we see in there.","So there are a lot of factors that go into it. And we've got a very smart operations research team within our consumer business that is working on that every day to make sure that not only are we capturing and targeting all of the homes that we should be targeting, but that we're doing it in the right priority.","Michael McCormack","Great. Thanks.","Jeff Storey","With that, thank you very much Mike. Appreciate the question. Before we end today's call, I'd like to summarize a few key thoughts based on our progress in 2019 and the outlook for 2020. We are executing well on the capital allocation plan we announced last year. We are investing more in the business to drive growth and positioning our fiber network as the platform for delivering the solutions our customers need. We made excellent progress on our objective to reduce leverage, extend maturities and lower interest expense. And as you saw, our interest expense for 2020 is more than $300 million lower than we paid in 2018 and we still returned over $1 billion in the form of a dividend to our shareholders in 2019.","For our iGAM and Enterprise business units, we met our objective for growth in the second half of 2019 compared to the first half of 2019 and we're optimistic about 2020. We had a solid start in our first year with our transformation initiatives, which not only improve the customer experience and increased efficiency throughout the organization, they reduce our cost to operate the business.","We delivered $430 million in annualized run rate savings as of the end of 2019. We operate what we believe to be the world's best fiber network and we will continue to focus our capital deployment on extending our fiber footprint and providing innovative solutions over that network to all of our customers.","All of these initiatives and accomplishments are aligned with our overall guiding principle to grow free cash flow per share. Thank you for joining today's call and your interest in CenturyLink. France, that concludes the call.","Operator","Thank you. We would like to thank everyone for your participation and for using the CenturyLink conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call. We ask that you please disconnect your lines.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, February 14, 2018.","I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Tony Davis, Vice President of Investor Relations with CenturyLink. Please go ahead.","Tony Davis - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Ash, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our call today to discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2017 earnings results released earlier this afternoon.","The slide presentation we will be reviewing during the prepared remarks portion of today's call is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at ir.centurylink.com. At the conclusion of our prepared remarks today, we will open the call for Q&A.","As you move to slide two, you'll find our Safe Harbor language. We will be making certain forward-looking statements today, particularly as they pertain to guidance for full-year 2018 and other outlooks in our business.","Unless otherwise noted, prior periods are provided on a year-over-year basis. Metrics discussed today on the call exclude acquisition-related expenses associated with the Level 3 transaction. Those metrics are adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditures, free cash flow and net leverage, and we've footnoted the details in our press release and earnings presentation.","Pro forma results discussed today exclude the May 1, 2017, sale of the data centers and colocation business and reflect purchase accounting adjustments and intercompany eliminations related to the November 1, 2017, acquisition of Level 3 by CenturyLink. We also ask that you review our disclosure found on this slide, as well as in our press release and in our SEC filings, which describe factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected by us in our forward-looking statements.","Now moving to slide 3, we ask that you also note that our earnings release issued earlier this afternoon and the slide presentation and remarks made during this call contain certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP financial measures and the most comparable GAAP financial measures are available in our earnings release and on our website at ir.centurylink.com.","And now as we move to slide 4, your host for today's call is Glen Post, CenturyLink's Chief Executive Officer. Joining Glen on today's call are Jeff Storey, CenturyLink's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Sunit Patel, CenturyLink's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Our call today will be available for telephone replay and webcast replay through May 8, 2018. Anyone listening to a telephone or webcast replay or reading a written transcript of this call should note that all information presented is current only as of today, February 14, 2018, and should be considered valid only as of this date regardless of the date heard or viewed.","And now as we move to slide 5, I'll turn the call over to Glen Post. Glen?","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Tony, and thank you all for joining our call today as we discuss CenturyLink's fourth quarter 2017 results, our progress on the integration of CenturyLink and Level 3, and the 2018 outlook for our business.","For the next few minutes, I will discuss CenturyLink's continued transformation to one of the world's leading network providers and will also make a few remarks about fourth quarter results and some of our plans for 2018. I will then hand the call over to Sunit to review fourth quarter results in more detail and discuss our 2018 business outlook. And following Sunit, Jeff will provide an operations review of our business, including an update on our sales and operations integration and alignment to date, and the opportunities and challenges he sees in the months ahead for our business.","As we move into our first full year of the combined operations of CenturyLink and Level 3, we'll talk for a minute about a look back basically. If you look into late 2016, we announced the sale of our data center and colocation businesses and the acquisition of Level 3, two milestone transactions that helped sharpen our focus on core network services.","As you know, we successfully completed the sale of the data centers and colocation business effective May 1, 2017, and of course, the acquisition of Level 3 effective November 1 of last year. Both of these transactions represented significant steps forward and CenturyLink becoming one of the leading network services providers in the world. Upon closing the Level 3 transaction, we immediately began implementing our integration plan to successfully bring the two companies together.","I am very pleased with how this integration is progressing. And given our ability to gain additional insights since closing, we're even more confident in our ability to achieve our annual run rate operating and capital expense synergy targets of $850 million and $125 million respectively. Jeff will talk in more detail about our integration efforts a little later.","We enter 2018 a much different company than only a year ago, and I want to talk briefly about our operational focus as we head into 2018. Our principal operational focus is to drive long-term profitable revenue growth and free cash flow generation so that we can both continue to invest in our business and sustain our strong dividend. We are prioritizing our investments and operational initiatives that we believe will help support that outcome.","First, we are focused on creating great customer experiences. We are simplifying and automating products, processes, and systems. We are increasing digitization of end-to-end service delivery platforms, allowing more efficient customer-friendly interactions. And we're improving our managed service delivery and service model to enable us to better meet our customers' needs.","Second, we are focused on investing with discipline to expand key network capabilities and to take fiber deeper into the network. And while we invest for future growth, we have significant opportunities to increase market penetration in areas where we have enabled strong broadband capabilities and related services in recent years.","Third, we know we must optimize operating and capital efficiencies while successfully integrating people, processes, and systems throughout our company. We expect to drive efficiencies through product portfolio and processes simplification, as well as through greater automation. And we are increasing the discipline and rigor of our capital allocation process to ensure our investments are focused on network customer experience and efficiency realizations.","Finally, we will continue our focus on stabilizing and improving sales and revenue effectiveness and productivity as we solidify our new organization structure and continue the successful integration of CenturyLink and Level 3.","Over the last several years, we have positioned CenturyLink from a legacy-focused telco with limited prospects for growth to a fiber-focused provider of advanced data services and global network and customer base. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we're excited about our future and look forward to updating you on the progress toward making ourselves the world's best network provider.","Before turning the call over to Sunit, I just want to point out that our fourth quarter results as a combined company largely met our expectations. Our pro forma consolidated revenue was $6 billion. And adjusted EBITDA excluding acquisition-related costs was over $2.2 billion. Our 450,000-route mile fiber network, the more than 350 connected metro markets, and our 100,000 fiber-enabled on-net buildings, along with our network connections in over 60 countries, provide us the scale and scope to compete globally with our enterprise products and services. I am confident in our 2018 business outlook and in our leadership team's ability to successfully integrate our companies and meet the needs of our customers.","And with that, I will turn the call over to Sunit for a review of our financial results.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Glen, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. I'll provide a brief overview of each company's standalone results, followed by a review of our combined company pro forma results for the fourth quarter. After that, I'll discuss how we will be reporting our go-forward results, and I'll wrap up with a discussion of our financial outlook for 2018.","I'd like to start with slide 7. We expect adjusted EBITDA to increase year-over-year. We also expect to be free cash flow positive after dividends in 2018, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our targeted adjusted EBITDA synergies of $850 million and CapEx synergies of $125 million.","Turning now to slide 8 for an overview of CenturyLink's standalone fourth quarter results, total operating revenue in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% to $3.964 billion, primarily due to a decline in legacy revenue and the colocation sale in May of 2017. Core revenues declined 8.4% and strategic revenue declined 6.1% in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the colocation sale, core revenue declined 4.7% and strategic revenue grew 1.4%.","Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $1.471 billion. This is a $74 million sequential improvement compared to $1.397 billion in third quarter of 2017. This improvement was driven by lower seasonal labor and utility costs combined with approximately $20 million of one-time favorable items in the fourth quarter.","In addition, we had expected to recognize a $25 million to $30 million favorable carrier settlement in the fourth quarter. But as part of our network optimization integration work for the combined company, we determined it was not in our best long-term interest to enter into this settlement.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter 2017 were $528 million. This compares to $749 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $963 million from the year-ago quarter. Full-year 2017 capital expenditures were $2.886 billion, which were a bit higher than we expected. We are aligning capital spending with revenue performance and increasing our focus and investments on projects with predictable returns.","Moving to slide 9, CenturyLink enterprise strategic revenue increased 1.9%. In the quarter, we saw continued strength from our MPLS offering, which was partially offset by declines in broadband data services.","Turning to slide 10, consumer revenue decreased 5.6%. Consumer strategic revenue was essentially flat. We saw a net loss of about 90,000 broadband subscribers this quarter, which were made up of losses of about 140,000 at speeds under 20 megs and gains of approximately 50,000 in higher-speed offerings with a higher average ARPU. We are continuing to see success with our simplified Price For Life offering.","For Level 3 standalone, we met the outlook we set at the beginning of 2017. For the full-year 2017, we delivered adjusted EBITDA of $2.979 billion, compared to our outlook of $2.94 billion to $3 billion, and free cash flow of $1.141 billion, compared to our outlook of $1.1 billion to $1.16 billion. Capital expenditures for the full-year 2017 were $1.326 billion, or 16% of total revenue.","Turning to slide 11 of our presentation, total revenue grew 3.3% and CNS revenue grew 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Total wholesale CNS revenue declined 1.8%. And total Enterprise CNS revenue, excluding UK government, grew 6% in the fourth quarter 2017. Enterprise CNS revenue was strong in all regions, in particular, North America Enterprise CNS revenue grew 5.6% year over year and 4.4% sequentially, driven by strong growth in government revenue, which was from one-time low margin professional services revenue. Excluding that one-time revenue, we grew North America Enterprise CNS revenue more than 2% sequentially.","Turning now to slide 12, adjusted EBITDA was $758 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $724 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.9% in the fourth quarter of 2017 and 35.6% in the fourth quarter of 2016. Level 3 generated free cash flow of $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $266 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.","I'd like to move to some highlights for the combined company; these results are on a pro forma basis assuming the merger was completed in the beginning of 2016 and include the effects of purchase price accounting and the elimination of both intercompany revenue and expenses and revenue and expenses related to the sale of the data center and colocation business.","Going forward, we'll report revenue in the following categories: business, Consumer and regulatory, which includes CAF and other support funds. As you can see from the chart on slide 13, business revenue represents 74%, Consumer revenue represents 23%, and regulatory revenue represents about 3% of total revenue.","We will also report revenue by our five customer-facing business units: Consumer, small and medium enterprise, strategic enterprise, international and global accounts and wholesale and indirect. Additionally, we'll report revenue by five product categories: IP and data services, transport and infrastructure, voice and collaboration, IT and Managed Services, and regulatory. Historical pro forma results for our business units dating back to the fourth quarter of 2016 can be found in today's earnings release.","Turning to adjusted EBITDA on slide 14, we are defining adjusted EBITDA to exclude stock-based compensation expense, integration and transaction costs and revenue and expenses associated with the sale of the data center and colocation business. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $2.211 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 and was seasonally higher due to lower labor expenses and utility costs. Our full-year 2017 pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $8.698 billion. Pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.8% for the fourth quarter 2017, and our full-year 2017 pro forma adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.1%.","Moving to synergies on slide 15, we have achieved approximately $75 million of annualized run rate adjusted EBITDA synergies. As most of you are aware, we are targeting $975 million of annualized run rate synergies, which are comprised of $850 million in operating expense synergies and $125 million in capital expense synergies. We are confident that we can capture the majority of the targeted run rate adjusted EBITDA savings over the next three years.","Additionally, we expect to achieve the $125 million of CapEx synergies this year. At the time of the acquisition announcement, we said we expect to incur a total of approximately $685 million in integration-related expenses. Please note, transaction-related expenses were not part of our estimate of our total integration-related expenses. Integration-related expenses for the fourth quarter were $62 million. In total, we've incurred approximately $170 million in integration-related expenses at the adjusted EBITDA line.","Additionally, we've incurred approximately $250 million in transaction-related expenses since we announced the merger in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our trailing 12-month net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio at the end of the fourth quarter was 4.3 times on a pro forma basis, excluding acquisition-related expenses. Our target leverage range is three times to four times. We remain confident that we will be able to drive down our leverage ratio every year as we grow adjusted EBITDA.","I will also note, our weighted average cost of debt is currently about 5.7% with 65% being fix rate and 35% being variable-rate debt. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a tax benefit of $1.1 billion as a result of the tax reform. This was driven by the lower 21% rate versus a 35% rate applied against the net deferred tax liability of CenturyLink, resulting in a benefit of $1.28 billion, partially offset by a chain charge from the reduced net deferred tax asset of Level 3, adjusting for purchase price accounting treatment of about $180 million. As we mentioned last quarter, we will not be providing revenue or quarterly outlooks going forward.","Turning to slide 16 and our outlook for full-year 2018, please note all outlook measures exclude integration expenses. For the full-year 2018, we expect adjusted EBITDA to grow from the pro forma $8.698 billion in 2017. We are defining free cash flow as cash flow from operations minus capital expenditures. We are providing two measures of free cash flow, before the dividend and after.","Excluding integration-related expenses for the full-year 2018, we expect free cash flow before the dividend of $3.15 billion to $3.35 billion. In addition, we expect free cash flow after the dividend of $850 million to $1.05 billion. Given our confidence in our cash flow profile, over the next few years, we remain committed to the dividend. Please note our free cash flow outlook assumes a $100 million pension contribution in 2018 in line with our contribution level in 2017.","Additionally, our cash flow outlook in 2018 benefits from income tax refunds, timing of incentive-based compensation and tighter management of accounts receivables and payables. In 2018, we expect to spend roughly 16% of total revenue on capital expenditures.","I want to take a moment to comment on tax reform and how it will benefit our business. We are pleased with this new legislation and see it as a positive to our business, both in the short-term and long-term. As you are aware, we have NOLs, which total approximately $9 billion. So in the short term, we expect the ability to expense most capital expenditures in all of our interest expense will initially slow down the utilization of our NOLs. In the first five years under the new tax law, we will see significantly reduced cash taxes. For the longer term, moving from a federal rate of 35% to 21% will add additional value, even as the benefits of expensing the capital expenditures begun to reverse.","For the full-year 2018, we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 25%. We expect first quarter 2018 adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2017 due to the $20 million in one-time credits I discussed earlier, combined with an increase in payroll taxes and other compensation expense items of about $40 million.","For the year, we expect integration costs at the adjusted EBITDA line to be higher than the $170 million in integration costs we have incurred through the end of 2017. I'll summarize by saying we are confident in our business outlook for the year. We expect adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margins to increase nicely over the next few years.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Sunit. Good evening, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","Sunit discussed the standalone results for Level 3 and CenturyLink, so I won't go into much detail about the former companies in my comments. I would like to start by saying Level 3 had strong results in the fourth quarter, and I'd like to thank the employees for staying focused and finishing strong. I'd also like to thank the former CenturyLink team; their commitment to the success of our business even during a time of significant change has not wavered.","From this point forward, my remarks will concentrate on the combined CenturyLink. It's been an exciting few months since we closed the acquisition in November, and we've made a lot of progress with integration in a relatively short period of time.","I'm frequently asked if there are any big surprises, either good or bad. The answer is generally no. We had a year of integration planning, and the team did a very good job evaluating what we needed to do. But I have been pleasantly surprised with the eagerness of our employees.","Since the close, I visited a number of our offices across the country, large and small. And you can see the excitement from our people regarding the opportunity ahead. They recognize and appreciate the tremendous challenges ahead as we transform the way we provide services and interact with our customers. However, they're excited about the company we're building.","While we are actively simplifying and harmonizing our product offerings, among the advantages of bringing the two companies together is a more robust product portfolio our sales team can take to the business market, and our expanded on-net footprint is already creating opportunities.","As many of you know, I believe the driver of long-term value is growth in free cash flow per share. Our strategy for improving free cash flow starts with enhancing the customer experience. The better our products meet the needs of the customers and the better we perform operationally, the higher the customer experience. One thing we know for sure is satisfied customers churn less and buy more.","Although capital efficiency is certainly a component of free cash flow, we don't intend to limit capital in an effort to generate free cash flow. We actually do just the opposite. We invest our capital to drive profitable revenue growth by enhancing our products, expanding our on-net footprint, simplifying our operating environment for employees, and improving the way we interact with our customers. We are implementing initiatives across all five of our business units.","As we discussed during our third quarter earnings call, we have organized each of the business units around specific customer groups. By focusing each business unit on the unique attributes of their particular customers, we can drive operational excellence and fine-tune our efforts by customer group to provide a differentiated experience.","Talking about digital transformation is not a new topic, but we are certainly undergoing a digital transformation at CenturyLink. Over the past few years, we have heavily invested in utilizing technologies like software-defined networking and network function virtualization to reduce our costs, enhance our own performance, and to deliver new capabilities to our customers. Expanding our product portfolio to couple services like SD-WAN with MPLS with wave transport or our Cloud Connect infrastructure and new products like Cloud Application Manager, we are using these same technologies to enable the hybrid networking capabilities our customers demand.","Across the company, there are concerted efforts underway to ensure we pursue profitable revenue growth. For example, we target customers that are either already in on-net buildings or in near-net buildings where we can expand our footprint. As a reminder, there are hundreds of thousands of buildings within 500 feet of our network.","Domestically and internationally, we have relatively low market share, and we believe we have significant opportunity to drive revenue growth over time. The key to our success is ensuring we have the appropriate relationship with each customer. In some cases, that may mean having a large sales team supporting a single customer and interacting on a daily basis. In other cases, it may be an entirely digital experience where the customers buy and utilize our service in a touchless way. We want to provide our services in the way our customers want to purchase and consume them.","I'd like to take a minute to walk you through each of our customer-facing business units, our go-to-markets approach, and how we're thinking about future growth. I'll start with the wholesale and indirect group. Our wholesale customers are a very important part of our business, and they give us scale and capabilities that we can deliver to them and our direct enterprise customers. With the broader footprint and enhanced product set we have as a combined company, we believe we are positioned to continue to serve our wholesale customers well. However, as I said for a long time, given continued industry consolidation, we expect revenue from wholesale to be flat to slightly down over the long term.","We have combined our indirect partners with our wholesale business. They tend to order through integrated interfaces and operate much like wholesale customers. The biggest difference is we view our indirect partners as a force multiplier of our sales team. We are able to leverage a large external sales force to sell our services to customers we would not be able to address directly. We expect to see continued growth through the indirect channel.","Moving to our global accounts or our GAM and international group and starting with our international opportunity, putting the two companies together has increased our scale and scope, and we serve customers in more than 60 countries on five continents, conducting business in 25 languages. Looking back, our LatAm business has shown strong growth in the enterprise channel and we expect that to continue. In EMEA, we've seen improving sales and revenue performance. We've also mitigated UK government declines, and it is now a small percentage of revenue.","From a GAM perspective, we've expanded the number of customers we serve with this team. These customers tend to have the most complex networking needs, which aligns well with CenturyLink's global scalable capabilities. We have 250 or so customers in GAM. And I'd say historically, both companies did an excellent job covering maybe the top 10% of these accounts. With better focus on the entire set of accounts, an improved engagement model, and by differentiating the customer experience we provide globally, I'm optimistic about the opportunity to grow revenue with our GAM customers.","Next is our North America strategic enterprise and federal government team, which we call GEAR internally. This team covers three primary customer groups, and we tailor our approach for each. For regional enterprise, we plan to optimize growth through a defined, repeatable, low-touch, and increasingly digital model. For large enterprise, we have customized global solutions in a high-touch model similar to GAM. The federal government group is very high-touch and serves the unique requirements of the government with a highly customized approach. We believe we have room to expand our current market share and can grow revenue across all three groups. We also remain firmly committed to our General Manager model to expand our network, optimize our local presence, and increase our profitability.","Next is our small and medium enterprise group, which we call GEMS. We have a great team in place here. While we want to continue to sell services within the legacy CenturyLink territory, we also see the opportunities to sell to small and medium enterprises in on-net buildings outside of legacy CenturyLink network. I'm very excited to now have the sales organization and processes in place to attack those buildings within the former Level 3 footprint. If we look across all of our enterprise groups, we believe GEMS can benefit the most from an increasingly digital environment, and we're focused on various initiatives to simplify the customer experience.","Rounding out the five customer-facing groups is our Consumer business, which is roughly 25% of our revenue. We're looking across the business to ensure we offer our customers the services they want and in the way they want to receive them. The short-term opportunity here is to maximize the investments we have already made. We have a significant number of homes that are enabled with speeds between 100 megabits and a gigabit. Even though most customers don't see the need for or used more than 40 megabits, we know we are more successful in selling when they have an upgrade path for the future. We've also implemented a number of changes to stabilize revenue and improve the customer experience. For example, we introduced a single price that won't change as long as the customer has the service called Price For Life.","Prior to this approach, we had various promotions and discounts that would roll off over time. This was not a very customer-friendly approach as customers viewed the loss of discounts as rate increases. Our new approach improves the customer perception, reduces the need for calling CenturyLink, which also reduces our costs and enhances the overall customer experience.","We believe that just as important as our efforts in driving profitable revenue growth is improving operational efficiency and effectiveness across our business. It's more important than just synergies. Don't get me wrong. Reaching our synergy targets is very important and we're on track to do so, but it's also important we support our customers as efficiently as possible going forward.","Many of you have heard me say that taking costs out of the business not only improves the bottom-line, it also improves the customer experience. If we can handle the customer's concern in a single call, or better yet with a single online interaction, our costs will be lower. However, if the customer has to call us back a second, third or even a fourth time, not only can that add four times the cost to providing the service; it creates a very bad experience for the customer. Driving costs out of our business also drives the customer experience up.","Another example is moving a customer from off-net provider onto the CenturyLink network. When we do this, we reduced what we paid to our competitors, improve our profitability, and provide a better end-to-end experience for our customer.","I'll now shift and provide a brief update on integration. Starting with the sales force integration, I'm pleased to say that we are substantially complete with integrating the two sales teams. All sellers are now aligned to their go-forward business unit and organizational structure. Where we were previously operating with a dual accounting structure with both companies supporting a customer, account transitions have been largely completed and we now have a single account team in place.","We are on a single instance of our customer relationship management system, which goes a long way to help the overall management of the sales team and standardization in our go-to-market approach. Sale is, obviously, the most critical function and often an area that erodes for a few quarters after an acquisition closes. Teams are learning new products, new systems and in some cases, new customers. We've implemented a sales support center as a resource for sales teams to call as they come up the learning curve on the combined company.","Some other highlights, the company's network backbones were interconnected early in the process. Customer migrations to on-net have begun and will be completed over the next several years. We'll be deliberate about the migration process and are looking at it from a customer impacting perspective rather than a geographic or CenturyLink-oriented view. We believe this approach minimizes disruption for our customers and provides a better customer experience.","The teams have developed the IT systems integration roadmap and are beginning to execute on that road map. We expect to complete the initial enterprise resource planning or ERP system integration in the second quarter and consolidate major customer portals, allowing customers to sign into the portal with the single password. Similarly, we have identified our in-state product road map and execution is in progress.","As within the integration of this, along with IT systems are long-term, but critical efforts. In addition to these specific integration accomplishments, we are remaining disciplined across our business. We've introduced capital governance and enterprise governance processes to ensure we prioritize and maximize our investments and resources.","In summary, our goal is to focus on products and services where we can win in the market and where winning means something significant to us. We are being disciplined about the opportunities we pursue and our focus on cost transformation and managing the business efficiently through an integrated digital experience.","I'll now turn the call over to the operator for your questions. Operator, can you explain the process?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. The first question comes from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, guys. A couple if I can. Jeff what are you seeing from customers who, Glen, had talked about? And I think you as well have been talking about holding back from signing contracts earlier in the year before the deal. What kind of progress have you seen there?","And then second on the Consumer side, broadband losses continue. What are your thoughts on the consumer broadband strategy going forward? Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Phil. Holding back, that's one of those things that we see periodically. And if you look at the sales from customers during 2017, we saw increasing sales through the first quarter, the second quarter, third quarter. Sales were a little bit lighter in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter, but we're stronger year-over-year versus the fourth quarter of 2016. So, we're starting to see customers recognizing how to work with the combined company. And so I wouldn't say that they are particularly any big deals being held back. Most of that concern from customers is behind us and we should start seeing deals continue to close.","From a Consumer perspective and a broadband perspective, we have a significant footprint that has been activated with high speed. We need to focus on selling what we've got. We have opportunities to sell more high-speed or very high speed 100-megabit and above, 40-megabit and above. We need to make sure that we're doing that. We have plenty of footprint out there that we can go and sell. We'll continue to deploy more in fiber into our network, getting it closer and closer to enterprise customers \u2013 or, excuse me, Consumer customers and making that higher speed available to the larger footprint.","And then we have the benefit of being able to spread that fiber deployment across not only our consumer customers, but our small and medium enterprise customers, our larger enterprise customers, passing more buildings and going into more buildings. And so we believe fiber is good and we'll continue to build back closer and closer to customers. But the primary effort right now for us in our Consumer business especially with high-speed IT is to make sure that that we provide a great customer experience, we reduced churn by providing a great customer experience, and we sell in the footprint where we think we really have a very competitive product.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, Jeff.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","And Phil, let me just add one thing to that. Our major losses on broadband is in where we have low 20-megabits of spectrum available or speed available. And last year \u2013 early last year, we made a decision to really focus more on the higher-value customers in enterprise, simplify the Price For Life plan and really trying to drive the higher ARPU, which we've done.","And as Jeff said, that the good news is we've got a lot of households of 9.8 million households available with 40 megabits or higher and 4.4 million available on the 100 megabits or more at the year-end, so we have a lot of capacity to sell into and that will be our focus as Jeff said.","Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much, folks. Two, if I may. I was wondering if you could discuss your thoughts around the enterprise spending environment at this point. One other provider of services have discussed the potential opportunity for improved spending trends on the back of some of the tax reform we've seen. Are you folks seeing any sort of leading indicators as to where demand trends could go?","And then perhaps secondly, you'd mentioned focusing on product and services to win and where winning means something to the company. How should we think about sort of the focus or trajectory of revenues within that context? I recognized that you're not providing revenue guidance, but if we can think about the different moving pieces as to how you can get and achieve that EBITDA cash flow guidance that you've set, I think that would be helpful. Thanks very much.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. So I think I'll take a stab at both and Jeff or Glen might want to add. So on the enterprise spending environment, yes, while we believe that tax reform is a positive, you've heard other people talk about it, at the end of the day, I think we look at the backdrop in terms of the demand environment for the kind of services we are offering and what customers are trying evolved to new hybrid infrastructures for both cloud and bandwidth requirements on their own premises, including how they interact with their customers. So I think that in general, we continue to see bit growth which is why Jeff made the comment about on-net and driving our fiber footprint deeper across to serve all our customer segments.","On the second question, I think the key here is, certainly on the enterprise side, I mean we \u2013 anyone on the Consumer side for that matter, but more certainly on the enterprise side, our goal is to improve our revenue performance over time in line with the comments that Jeff and Glen made. And I certainly think our position from a network footprint and comprehensive products and portfolios we have and the on-net buildings we have and the continued investments we make, we think we should be able to drive a little better performance over time on the revenue side.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And just to add on the enterprise spending comment. We see our customers needing the products and services that we have. So hopefully, the ability to capitalize infrastructure \u2013 to expense capitalize infrastructure and other things will help customers invest. But whether there's a good economy or a bad economy, our customers need the types of products and services we provide, and we've seen that over time that in a bad economy, they want to move to more cost-effective infrastructures, and so they move to newer technologies and move to the capabilities that we have.","In a good economy, they're trying to accelerate their growth and make sure that they are able to meet their customers' needs, and so they want our expandable services and our capabilities. And so for a fairly long time, we see customers moving to us because they need our products and services kind of independent of the economy. But we do think and are hopeful that the tax environment will make them purchase more and invest more.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So just a quick follow-up though. It doesn't seem like that expectation is embedded into your outlook currently. Is that a correct way to think about things?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","That's correct.","Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much for the incremental color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thanks a lot. Good evening. Sunit, on the 2018 EBITDA guidance, what are you assuming for synergy realization going through the year? Is it fair that you mentioned the three-year target, is it fair to take that fairly linearly, or is that going to be more in years two or three?","And then I think you'd mentioned recently about a 500 basis point to 700 basis point margin opportunity. Can you just sort of review that for us? And should we take 2017 or 2018 as the kind of the base year for that target?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thanks Simon. So I think on the synergy realization, typically what we see is the first year is the steepest part of the curve, and then you get the full run rate benefit in the second year. And then after that, it starts tailing off. So usually, we get a lot of the benefit \u2013 we should see a lot of the benefit in terms of reported benefit you will see this year and next year, the run rate benefit a little more this year, some next year, and then it tails off in the third year. So in general, that's the pattern we see.","On the EBITDA margin, to your question, I think in general, we continue to expect to see the EBITDA margin expand nicely over the next three to five years. I think we said even at the time of the announcement that with synergies and everything pro forma, we should be north of 40%-plus EBITDA margins over the next few years, and we continue to feel quite confident and comfortable with that. So I think you will see the margin expansion in terms of the basis points that you described.","Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey guys, thanks. Congrats on a good quarter. So, Sunit, a couple more questions on the guide, so there's about a $550 million delta between looking at EBITDA minus interest minus pension minus tax minus CapEx and the free cash flow guide. And you highlighted, I think, working capital, which would be a recurring potential benefit; tax refunds which aren't recurring. So if you can bridge us to what that $550 million break down into would be super-helpful.","And then just second, I think you called out some one-time items that are going to weigh on 1Q. So I guess people are going to look at the fourth quarter number, take that down, and I guess we're then expecting the EBITDA cadence to be a synergies compound ramping, I guess, over the course of the year. I guess some cadence guidance on the EBITDA would be helpful too. Thanks.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Sure. So with your first question, that number, the biggest portion is tax refund, which we expect for taxes from 2017. So that's why it flows through the working capital \u2013 I mean through that working capital line.","And then secondly, the second item that I mentioned in my comments was the timing of incentive-related compensation. So for example, one example but there are a couple of things, typically for the case of Level 3, we paid bonuses the year following year end, so 2017 bonuses were typically paid in 2018 in this case. But with the timing of the close, some of those were paid through the end of the first 10 months or those were paid through the first 10 months in 2017. And so we won't be paying them in 2018, so that's a benefit.","And then the third thing I had mentioned is just working capital management on receivables and payables, so that's the third component in order of magnitude. And we think there will continue to be opportunities to improve that even next year when you look at the DSOs, for example. So those are the components.","I think when you see through that and you go in subsequent years, in general we expect the working capital line to be a slight of a negative. And by slight, I mean in the scheme of things, small compared to our cash flow generation. So I think that helps you get you a sense of as we look longer term. So it will be a little bit a use of cash, and that has to do more with the pension funds and other forced retirement benefit expenses. But some of that will be offset at least over the next year by continued improvement in receivables and payables.","And then on the question on transitioning from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, I think in simple terms, we'll see about the kind of magnitude change I talked about, $20 million on the one-time credits that I explained, and then $40 million, which really has to do with a change in incentive-based compensation and typically higher payroll taxes in the first quarter. So when you add that together, it's $20 million and $40 million, it's about $60 million. So I think that hopefully helps people calibrate to the starting point in the first quarter. And then given the guide for the year, I think that helps interpolate that pretty well.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, Sunit. And if I can just do one quick follow-up, I think over the last couple years, CenturyLink has proven to be apparently pretty notoriously difficult to guide for. And could you give us a sense \u2013 and you've expressed this conviction that you feel good about the numbers. But with your fresh set of eyes looking at an old set of books, where does that conviction really come from? What process did you go through that makes you think that you've got it nailed down where for the last few years, it really hasn't been?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","I think there are a couple of elements. We've had a year of integration planning and all the various organizations were announced from the summer months onwards. And as we mentioned even last quarter, everyone had their budgets and targets for 2018 by the end of October. And as Jeff also mentioned and Glen alluded to, we have taken a much harder look at capital governance processes, capital allocation processes, return investment criteria. We have spent a lot of time as we worked on integration planning on the synergy plan with respect to things like non-head count expenses. In RFPs, we run with suppliers both for capital expenditures and non-head count expenses on the operating expense side. We have spent a fair bit of time very specifically looking at our plans for network expense reductions and the capital expenditures it takes to do that.","So I think on a whole multitude of efforts across the whole organization and the fact that everyone is executing on their plans, and also we hope we've taken a fairly realistic appraisal of the revenue trends looking at more historical trends. Recently, I feel \u2013 we feel having looked at all of that and considered it with some margin of safety, we are very confident of the guide that we provided for 2018.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'd just like to add. We're also using our organizational structure differently, we've organized around the customer and our business units to give us greater focus, greater intensity, greater visibility into each of those customer segments and greater visibility into the profitability of this Customer segments. And so we have organized around profitability. We have organized around driving success with our customers and feel fairly confident about our visibility into the business at this point.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And the only final point I'd add is, I think we'll hopefully try to improve the elasticity of the responsiveness of the organization. So we can manage and adjust levers as we see how we are performing every month. So hopefully, it can be more flexible in how we adjust a little more quicker, so I think hopefully that should also \u2013 that also gives us some more confidence.","David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thank you all. Good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Scott Goldman with Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks. I guess, just wanted to follow-up to David's question on free cash flow and make sure I understand, Sunit. It sounds as though you're saying there's a decent working capital benefit that rolls through in 2017 on the back of tax refund and the timing and other working caps stuff that you just laid out. So as we think about sort of exiting 2018 into 2019, is it fair to sort of back out those and say that sort of the starting point? And then you have initiatives around DSOs and that type of thing going into 2019. Just want to make sure I understood that properly?","And then secondly, just on the broadband side of the equation, seems like sort of a tale of two cohorts there, with obviously, the lower speed guide is churning off and showing success on the high-speed guide. Wonder if you could help give us a sense for where that base is today? I'm trying to just size what the potential risk is within that base on the low or the opportunity to move them up into the high-speed would be going forward? Thank you.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Okay. So I'll answer the first question and Jeff, maybe you can do the consumer one. But in essence, I think as I said, the biggest component is the tax refund from last year's taxes followed by the incentive-based comp I talked about. And I think I just summarized it best by saying when you go forward, generally working capital should be neutral to slight use of capital going forward as you look in future periods. And that includes the pension expense funding that we talked about or takes that into consideration.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And Scott, I don't have an exact mix of how many customers are below 20 megs and above 40 megs. But it's a fairly large number below 20 megs that are churning. But our opportunity is to continue \u2013 those are customers that have been around for a very long time and our opportunities continue to improve our network, improve the speeds that we offer to those low speed customers. And they are moving from that low-speed onto the high-speed capabilities. And so we'll continue to focus on that as Glen said, we have a significant number of households past that are addressable with very high-speed, and we will continue to sell to those customers and position our products and services with those customers and continue to upgrade for the very low-end.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","And one other point on the guide, remember we said that outlook does not include integration expenses, and we gave you a sense of that and there'll be some in the capital expenditures side. But those expenses will be more one-time in nature and then obviously, there will be a benefit in future periods when you look at your forecast after taking into consideration integration costs.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","And just one quick follow-up on the Consumer broadband side. As you think about the non-Price-For-Life customers, what's the thoughts or strategy around pricing as you go into 2018, Jeff?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","Well, the strategy has moved to Price For Life. One of the things that we saw \u2013 in 2016, we put in a lot of promotions and discounts and what that feels like to the customer is these promotions and discounts roll off six months after they signed them. They don't feel like, now the discount's gone, they feel like we gave them a rate increase. And so it's not a very customer-friendly way to do it. But it also drives activity within our business, drives calls, drives dissatisfaction from the customer. And so we will move \u2013 continue to move to Price For Life for those customers and for making it simpler for them to buy and consume our products.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I'll just add to that, that even for our 20-meg and below customers move more towards the Price For Life, simple pricing, favor for those lower price. Speed customers, of course, had lower price plans. So we are seeing some success in those markets where we've rolled that out.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","And we have over 1 million customers. We rolled Price For Live, I don't know, less than six months ago or so, maybe a little longer. And we have over 1 million customers on it already, so it's been very successful. Our customers have reacted well to it and it makes the experience they have with us feel better for them.","Scott Goldman - Jefferies LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the questions and just one hopefully last clarification on the cash taxes. Your guidance does say you'll be paying cash taxes of $100 million. I think you're sort of saying that the refund and that payment are two distinct things. Is that the right way to interpret it?","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","It's the right way to think about it, because the cash income taxes, pertains to taxes that we expect to pay for 2018 income. The refund was a refund from taxes for 2017, so the refund would not show up to the income tax line. It shows up in the working capital line, so that is correct.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you, okay. So I know you're not giving formal revenue guidance, but we can kind of infer what you're expecting based on the CapEx range you gave and the reconciliation and the CapEx intensity and if you sort of do math on that, it sort of suggests you guys think you're going to have a pretty sustainable top-line on a pro forma basis in 2018. So I was hoping you can maybe just provide a little more context around where you see things firming that gave you that conviction?","And then, Jeff, hopefully as a component of that answer, you can maybe just address MPLS because it feels like that's a big mystery for investors. They're not really sure how to assess the extent to which there is still demand, or which there may be a risk to that business as we go ahead. I'm not sure people really even understand how much of your business comes from MPLS. So sorry, a lot in there, but it will be helpful to get that color.","Sunit S. Patel - CenturyLink, Inc.","Let me start with revenue. As I said, I mean, I think we think that we should be able to drive slightly better revenue performance over time. And the story is \u2013 you mentioned is a little different in various each of these customer-facing areas. So won't go through that in detail other than just say that I think that given our position as a second largest wireline carrier serving enterprises in our fiber network, in our footprint, in our products and services, we should be able to do a better job of gaining share from our competitors who are principally more focused in other segments like wireless and content. So I think we've tried to be realistic with that. So I think that's all I'll say on the revenue side. And I'll turn it over to Jeff for the other question.","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","On MPLS, MPLS is an important product for us because our customers wanted, they need it. They need secure communications between large branch offices, it's scalable, it meets their needs. We can put multiple applications over the top of it. But we are also very excited about things like SD-WAN. We have a great capability that we've been working on in CenturyLink for a couple of years and we think that's going to be a huge product for us.","Our customers have networking challenges that are not solved by one-size-fits-all or one product fits all. We will sell MPLS where that makes sense. We will sell the waves where that makes sense. We will go to our customers with SD-WAN where that makes sense. One of the things that we've become very good at, at CenturyLink is the migration of other old technologies onto new technologies. And I don't think it's an either or between SD-WAN and MPLS. I think it's both. But we have a very good at making sure that we sell the right product to the right customer for the right applications. And we think MPLS is important in that, and we think other products are important in that. So I don't know if that fully answers the question, Brett. But we think it's going to continue to be part of our product portfolio that's significant for us.","Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Batya Levi with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you. Can you provide a little bit more color on your comment about aligning CapEx with revenue performance this year? You mentioned on net focus. Should we expect any significant changes versus where CapEx was spent last year? And maybe also if you could update plans to how many consumer locations you plan to reach with fiber? I think CenturyLink had plans to do about 3 million homes by 2019. Thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","All right. So I think on the capital question, I think just to quick thing, we are seeing the benefit of the synergies in the CapEx. We think the guide we provide on CapEx addresses revenue growth and other needs. We have to keep driving profitable growth. So most of it will be success based. The allocation of capital, I think as I talked about, we're going to shift harder in making sure it's for return profiles that are higher, more, take advantage of our on-net footprint, predictable whether it's a cost reductions or driving profitable margin growth. We've changed our governance process.","So from an allocation perspective as we've also said, we aim to continue to invest in the Consumer business, but it being more directed towards where we can extend our fiber footprint and enable \u2013 both enable more higher-speed broadband households plus work on penetrating the ones we've already enabled. So I think that's really the summary on capital. And then, Jeff, I don't think \u2013 do you have anything to add?","Jeffrey K. Storey - CenturyLink, Inc.","I don't think there's anything to add to that.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Double opportunity. We've got to do well with the households that have enabled with higher speeds, which has increased quite significantly over the last couple of years with the money that CenturyLink has spent on whether it's a factoring or bonding or just pushing the fiber footprint deeper. And two, we continue to believe both with CAF funding and other more specific market opportunities, we've got the ability to invest money to push the fiber deeper in both enable more households and succeed better with them.","Batya Levi - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thank you.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","I would say, really good. The very disciplined approach to capital allocation and that's where we're headed and we can drive returns profitability, we'll certainly do that. But we have a lot of previously built capacity built into and sell into this year.","Operator","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Post for any concluding remarks.","Glen F. Post - CenturyLink, Inc.","Thank you, Ash. CenturyLink is now the second largest domestic communications provider serving global enterprise customers, and we believe we are well-positioned to deliver a great customer experience and a wide-array of communication products and services to gain market share over time. We are confident in our ability to successfully integrate CenturyLink and Level 3, and we're excited about the opportunities that lie before us.","We do expect to drive long-term shareholder value through free cash flow growth, return of cash to shareholders via dividend and most importantly, by providing our customers with the products and services that they need to operate effectively in a digital world. Thank you for joining our call today. We look forward to working with you in the months ahead. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, Mr. Post. We would like to thank, everyone, for your participation and for using the CenturyLink conferencing service today. This does conclude the conference call. We ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day, everyone."]}}
