Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]","Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 first quarter results and you may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app.","During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First we'll be talking about results for the first quarter of 2017, and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume and PMI market share performance now reflect cigarettes PMI\u2019s heated tobacco units for those markets that have commercial sales of iQOS.","A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.","Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning while increasing our 2017 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rate for $0.04 to a range of 484 to $4.99 for a favorable tax item only. Our guidance continues to include $0.08 of unfavorable currency. Excluding currency and the tax item our guidance represents a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12 % compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","AS a reminder, we expect that our currency neutral financial growth to be skewed towards the second half of 2017 notably reflecting increased heated tobacco unit capacity and improving returns on our RRP investments as the year unfolds.","Let me now thank you for our first quarter results beginning with our combined cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume which declined by 9.4 or 7.8% excluding estimated inventory movement. The decline was due primary to the impact of lower cigarette industry volume partly reflecting the micro-economic environment in Indonesia, Pakistan, Philippines and Russia as well as the high prevalence of illicit trade in Pakistan and Philippines.","As seen on the left side of the slide over half of the total decline consisted of low price segment volume some of which contributed very little, if any, unit margin. This limited the impact on our profitability and differs dramatically from the overall price segment split of our premium position portfolio as shown on the right. Our first quarter volume decline was slightly larger than anticipated due to essentially to the lower industry volume in Pakistan and Philippines as well as the magnitude of unfavorable inventory movements in Italy and Spain.","For the full year, we expect a combined decline of 3% to 4% broadly in line with last year. The expected improvement over the balance of the 2017 is supported by three main factors, the lapping of challenging first half comparisons versus 2016 in select geographies such as Argentina, the EU region and Turkey. A lower impact of estimated unfavorable inventory movements on full year basis and significantly higher heated tobacco unit volume. Despite the cigarette driven volume decline net revenues in the first quarter increased by 1.7% excluding currency. This growth reflected favorable pricing particularly in Asia and EEMA regions as well as higher heated tobacco unit and iQOS device sales. For the year we continue to anticipate currency neutral net revenue growth above 6%.","Adjusted OCI declined by 1.7% excluding currency primarily reflecting lower cigarette volume as well as significantly higher investments behind the commercialization of iQOS notably in the EU region and Japan. Adjusted diluted EPS were flat at $0.98 with no currency impact as the favorable effect of currency such as the Indonesian rupiah, Japanese yen, Russian ruble Swiss franc were offset by the negative effect related to the Egyptian pound, Mexican peso and Turkish lira.","Our strong pricing variance represents 6.7% of first quarter 2016 net revenues and included positive contributions from all four regions.","During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of market. Notably Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Turkey as well as other's shown on the slide. Our first quarter markets were excluding China and the US declined by 0.9 points to 26.8% due principally to brands in below premium price segment such as low price Morven Gold in Pakistan, Fortune and Jackpot in the Philippines and next global is in Russia. Our premium brands performed well in the quarter contributing 0.2 points of market share growth driven by the strong performance of our heated tobacco brand.","I will now discuss a few of our key geographies beginning with the origin. Industrial volume declined by 2.8% in the quarter, consistent with the secular decrease in the market and our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%. Our volume was down by 7.1% but was impacted by estimated unfavorable distributor cigarette inventor movements notably related to the implementation of the tobacco products directed in France, Italy and Spain. Excluding this event from movement, our volume declined by 2.9% broadly in line with the industry.","Our regional market share was essentially flat in the quarter with growth in market such as France, Germany, Poland and the UK, offset by declines notably in Italy and Spain. In Italy, the share decline was due mainly to Philip Morris reflecting the growth of the super-low price segment as well as Marlboro which is the only major cigarette brand above their own \u20ac5 per pack price point. Marlboro was also impacted by the TPD's ban on pack sizes of 10 cigarettes which contributed approximately 12% of the brand cigarette volume prior to the ban. On a sequential basis, our total share in Italy was slightly up versus the fourth quarter supported by the growth of fees. In Spain, the share declined was due principally from Marlboro cigarettes notably reflecting the brands passing of around \u20ac5 per pack price point in the vending channel which accounts for nearly 30% of Marlboro cigarette volume.","Moving to Russia. Industry volume declined by 7.9% in the quarter due primarily to the impact of X size pack delivering price increases. For the full year, we expect the decline to moderate to a range of 5% to 6%. Our February quarter to-date, cigarette share declined by 0.4 points versus the same period last year due mainly to the slower penetration of competitors price increases. However, our share has increased sequentially over the past few quarters driven by low price above three as well as Philip Morris which gets benefited in part from the consolidation of certain local brands in the Philip Morris trademark. As evidenced by the brand driving our sequential cigarette share performance, we are serving further down trading in Russia. While the presence of big parts has declined following the ban of the production as of July last year, residual volumes remained in the supply chain and we are continuing to witness price competition around limited pack editions with discounts equivalent to the per stick price of big pack. Importantly, we are effectively balancing our market share and profitability growth in Russia.","Turning now to the Philippines. We continue to prioritize the growth of our premium portfolio's profitability over the defense of the low margin volume and share. Higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix reflecting the strong performance of Marlboro draw profitability growth in the quarter despite the cigarette industry volume decline of 15.6%. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 5 points to 32.5% driven by switching from lower priced brands. To further highlight Marlboro strength, the sequential share has now increased for 11 straight quarters. Our total cigarette share decline in the quarter was due mainly to the timing of competitor's price increases as well as continued competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This led to widened price gaps notably compared to Fortune and Jackpot. We are therefore encouraged by the government's renewed focus on addressing illicit trade including excise stock stamp compliance. We are hopeful for sustained enforcement to address the usual long term which we believe should ensure that prices at the bottom of the market reflect full excise stocks payment.","In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume declined by 5.5% in the quarter reflecting the continued soft economic environment and above inflation tax driven retail price increases. While history shows that quarterly trends in the market can be volatile, we anticipate the decline of 1% to 2% for the full year in line with 2016. Our cigarette markets are declined by 0.5 points in the quarter due mainly to Sampoerna A, our leading lighter-tasting machine made exotic brand as well as Marlboro in the white segment following it's passing of the 20,000 rupiah per pack price point. The decline was partly offset by the growth of full-flavor machine made kretek offer such as U Bold and Marlboro Filter Black. The latter has been gradually expanded, and since it's initial launch in 25 cities last September and reached 1% international share in the first quarter. In Japan, the strong performance of IQOS continues to be the primary driver of our result. Market share increased by 5.4 points in the quarter to 30% driven mainly by the growth of Marlboro HeatSticks. Marlboro share including cigarettes and HeatSticks increased by 5.7 points to 17.1%. Industrial volume declined by 7.4% or by 4.3% excluding inventory movement. The strong performance of IQOS in Japan is further evidence by the weakly uptick shares for Marlboro HeatSticks. As seen on this chart, the brand closed the quarter with a weakly uptick share of 9.6% nationally, 11.6% in Tokyo and 14.9% in Sendai. We believe that the strong uptick performance in Sendai in particular clearly demonstrates the growing potential of the heated tobacco category in Japan.","Turning to the commercialization of IQOS more broadly, we have now launched IQOS in key cities in 24 markets globally following city launches in Columbia and Lithuania during the first quarter and in Poland and Serbia earlier this month. By year end, we continue to expect IQOS to be in key cities nationwide in a total of 32 to 35 markets subject to capacity. Importantly, our heated tobacco portfolio is beginning to achieve strong international market share growth sequentially in some of our yearly launch market beyond Japan. For example in Italy, Switzerland and Portugal, our national share reached 0.5%, 0.9% and 0.4% respectively in the first quarter of 2017. These results have been achieved despite IQOS focus area representing less than 35% of cigarette industry volume in each market.","Our share performance in Germany is also well full of highlighting. Giving the limited focus area and relatively brief period since launch, national market share data are not yet meaningful. However, heats have recorded strong sequential uptick share growth in Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich, reaching a combined share of 0.6% in the first quarter and 0.8% in the last week of March. Let me now provide an update on our heated tobacco unit capacity. We entered 2017 with approximately 15 billion units of installed annual capacity and continued to anticipate approximately 50 billion units of such capacity at the year-end. This translates to over 32 billion units in expected total capacity available for commercializations in 2017. As additional capacity has come online this year, we have begun to gradually increase the number of IQOS devices available for sale in Japan and will continue to do so as the year unfolds.","In addition, we have started to implement our plans to reach installed annual capacity of 100 billion units by the end of 2018. As a result, we expect to have approximately 75 billion units in total capacity available for commercializations in 2018.","In support of this plan, we recently announced our decision to convert our cigarette factory in Greece to heated tobacco unit production. Consequently, we are increasing our plant capital expenditures in 2017 to $1.6 billion from the $1.5 billion previously communicated. We continue to target operating cash flow of $8.5 billion this year.","In conclusion, our first quarter results generally came in as expected. Our cigarette volume was lower than anticipated. Our key assumptions for the full year remain intact, namely currency neutral net revenue growth of about 6%, supported by favorable pricing as well as higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales.","To build up on the exceptional performance of IQOS, we are making significant investments behind both commercialization and the expansion of heated tobacco unit capacity. Importantly, we currently estimate that approximately 1.8 million adult consumers have already quit smoking cigarettes and switched to IQOS.","Finally, the full year outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2017 EPS guidance reflects the growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% excluding currency and the favorable tax item, compared to a adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","Thank you and I will be happy now to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Chris. Good morning.","Chris Growe","Hi Jacek. How are you? Thank you. I just want to ask you two questions if I could. I just want to get a sense of you have this IQOS available in 24 markets today, there has been some comments saying it's going to go into France and there is more markets still to come throughout the year. As you look at your capacity development throughout the year, you've given the numbers clearly what's available for the year, but you're having a pretty quick uptake obviously in Japan I mean you need more and more volume for that market. I just want to get a sense of is it more important now to have this available in more markets or to make it more widely available in the existing markets in which you're in, do you have the capacity to do both of those in 2017?","Jacek Olczak","Okay, it look it takes a bit of time in each market to build necessary capacity infrastructure in order for the national expansion. So, I mean what we have learned so far from experience we have with the commercialization of IQOS is that that is the start always with one or two cities and start building the expansion based on what we had been learned and what we have installed in these cities. This requires quite significant employment of additional sales force but also creation establishment of IQOS stores, boutiques, Brexit stores etcetera.","So, we always will need that runway and essentially opening in these markets earlier does not put at this stage that much of a constrain on available capacity but allows us to build faster much broader ways ahead of 2018 or 2019. So this is how we look at this thing. And as you might have noticed Chris, we also have making now the decision to take this theoretical capacity expansion of a 4 billion per month which we have announced half a year ago that we have that option, we have decided to essentially implement this plan. So, we already committing ourselves to this 100 billion year-end capacity next year to essentially accelerating our plans.","Chris Growe","Okay. And do you still expect IQOS to achieve break-even probability in 2017?","Jacek Olczak","Absolutely.","Chris Growe","Okay and one quick one if I could on the volume performance for the underlying business and it was obviously weaker than we thought obviously weaker than with the new thought. And there is obviously some adjustments from inventory and timing changes and you gave some color around that but going forward, you'd expect a pretty significant improvement in the underlying volume performance of the business. I just want to get a sense of, so we look across a lot of the markets is there some pretty significant market share declines in some markets, do those start to narrow or is it more about IQOS developing and contributing to your overall volume? I just want get a sense of that balance you expect for the rest of the year.","Jacek Olczak","Look, I mean at some markets when we have posted in the quarter some more sizable market share loses, we have highlighted in my remarks and in my remarks the sequential development. So, in both markets we can see the improvements Q1 and Q4 or the sequential within a quarter etcetera. So, I think we keep that strong grip on the conventional business in the market where we for whatever reasons under pressure. I mean Italy is a little bit more complicated because on the one hand we were focusing on a combustible business while also building the base for the IQOS.","But there are some problems in Italy which frankly speaking beyond our power to execute as we noted the tax structuring in Italy is not very supporting for narrowing the price gaps, Marlboro is above the Marlboro in a conventional business, on a conventional cigarette, is above the \u20ac5 price point. So, I guess there will be some pressure on Italy on Marlboro in Italy in a conventional business continuing for the year. But on the other hand, Germany still continues to be on the strong term, France despite the fact that we have a first quarter, I know it\u2019s bit early of the plain pack implementation but France posted very good results in a quarter.","And the rest is purely the comps. Remember that we are comparing the first quarter to the relatively strong, weaker declines in Q1 of the first quarter last year in Argentina and then we had this in the last year for tax increase. The others, number of average geographies but we also faced a bit of most challenging comps in the Q1. What came if I may ask is what came as worse than our expectations frankly speaking is Italy and Spain when we have to take the inventory adjustments. I mean, we know that comparing to the Q1 last year, we will have to adjust but I think during the TPD buildup of inventories and especially in Italy conversion of stance or ban on the sales of tones. We have anticipated the higher conversion of tones to twenties when it comes to the retail stock replenishment and I think this went this come weaker than we thought, is it over or is it going to continue, we will have to see.","But anyway I mean we don't expect any major at this point inventory adjustment for the year. So, at least this had to be in these removed and as I said number of the comps if you look both in the yield but in other regions I mean we sure we should have it, I mean it should be more helpful and more supportive. And as I said, we still feel confident on the total volume outlook. Obviously, as you know we're focusing more on the combined volume, otherwise we will have to start making a number of assumptions with regard to the cannibalization etcetera but I think they are good proximity that we can close the year with the volume performance at par and may be even slightly better than what we have had for the full year last year.","Chris Growe","Okay. That was very good color. Thanks for your time.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with the Cowen.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Vivian.","Vivien Azer","So, just to follow up on Chris's question. So, if we're still looking to break even in '17 Jacek, given the momentum that the business is seeing, year on balance it would seem that you're still on track to generate incremental profits from IQOS in 2018 but how are you thinking about the need for reinvestment spending given your first mover advantage in the traction that you're seeing from the product and would you be able to offer any kind of order of magnitude guidance around what that level of profitability might look like? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","Look, we have said it I guess earlier this year that we look and we can reconfirm this here from this today, we are looking at the revenue growth above 6% and earlier we have said that we are still looking at the margin, operating profit margin expansion somewhere in the tune of 10 to 20 points. Clearly we could say that to achieve that better margin expansion but it is not factored in increase investments namely behind the IQOS. This is both on the OpEx and operating cost and I announced as we announced today also on the CapEx to prepare the capacity.","So, I think we well invested frankly speaking on the both sides both on a combustible, although there is some reallocation or allocation of the resources from a combustible business to reduce these product but I think we feel that pretty comfortable with the investment which we plan to make this year as I said to support the revenue growth above 6%.","Vivien Azer","That's helpful and just in terms of the longer term outlook for 2020, Olczak, you would point it to a higher profit number when you spoke at the Cage Conference. So, can you just offer a little bit contexts on what the implied HeatSticks volumes would be for that 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion an incremental profit? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, a number of times recently I'm being confronted with this question, Vivian. Yes, we gave that outlook I guess three years ago or so. And I have already admitted, maybe I shouldn\u2019t, I have admitted I think at the Cage Conference a few weeks ago both numbers seems to be wrong. Either 2020 was wrong and we are going to keep the target well ahead of this deadline or definitely the volume number was wrong. I mean, you could at the pace which we are cruising today, we see the penetrations in the markets are in Japan; it goes well above the 3% to 5% which we have marked the target for 2020. So, you have to give us the time to really put our brace around what really the size of that opportunity today. Clearly, it's a much bigger opportunity that we have felt two years ago but they would refrain from giving a new target at this stage.","We have also said to investors that in 2018, somewhere in 2018 we'll try to come up with a new improved vapor for PMI and I guess this would be the best timing to put some milestones what we want to achieve with our big objective to go to this smoke-free future as PMI.","Vivien Azer","That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong","So, first in Japan, so there's been some press reports about PM planning to take some pricing on your combustible business. So, can you confirm whether you file for price increase application in Japan and combustibles?","Jacek Olczak","Judy, you will appreciate but I can\u2019t comment on our future pricing decisions, at least at this stage. So, we will have to leave it as it is now.","Judy Hong","But when you kind of think about your full year guidance at this point, does that include any of the potential price increase in Japan?","Jacek Olczak","Judy, please I can\u2019t comment on our future pricing.","Judy Hong","That\u2019s fine. Alright. And then I guess staying in Japan, so obviously you've seen a pretty strong share gains even in Sendai as your competitor have launched in that market. So, how do you sort of look at that market and kind of what are the lessons learned in looking at that market and applying kind of a similar share performance to the broader Japanese market or your ability to kind of defend your share as your competitors begin to expand more nationally in Japan?","Jacek Olczak","Look, we just look at Sendai and maybe the data is not fully reliable for us and for our competitors. They are our competitors there but I think in Sendai in the quarter, the total heat-not-burn category must have crossed 20% market share. What I hear, what I know from our side and what I hear about our competitor without operating with some sort of a capacity limitation and I know that they are quite awaiting in Sendai and other places in Japan to buy IQOS or competitors device, which tells me that demand today is 20% and is growing and it has a large portion of unsatisfied demand. The people are not allowed to buy devices because the devices are not available. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sendai category and heat-not-burn category in Sendai would cross the 30% share of total market by the yearend and may be even that number is wrong.","I think we clearly can see the word of mouth in fact that people have been adults who have successfully managed to quit smoking and have moved to heat-not-burn category and sharing the benefit with the peers, with their colleagues etcetera. So, it\u2019s a classical word of mouth type of an effect. Category is gaining awareness both in terms of its existence and the benefit that category work for us.","So, it's our long goals for the great future but I think is a big question now what is really the how long that growth rates are going to be there and what is the ultimate size of that thing. Is it a 100% of the market? I guess, no but people, this is you remember me saying on number of occasions, this is not the most innovative industry if you look at the history of this industry, right. The filter cigarette, the filter bud and that's about it.","And then little bit about the capsules and a three or four months. It still get a while to convert cigarettes, conventional cigarettes from a non-filter to filter cigarette. But it happen in a less than in about five years 10 years depends on the market. Maybe, we in a front of such opportunity here, we'll have to see. I mean, it's all goes into the right direction. Obviously, Japan is a little bit in a better situation due to the marketing channels availability compared to our markets etcetera.","But even if we start factoring this in, you may just this feel to the on a timeline of the curve, the difference of a one or two years but since that the product might have -- there are consumer sizeable group of consumers, very sizeable group of consumers who are waiting for that one.","Judy Hong","Okay, got it. And then just lastly on the capacity related question. So, with the \u20ac300 million investment that you've talked about for the Greece plan, that gives you 20 billion additional fixed from an IQOS HeatSticks perspective. So, that would be 50 billion plus 20 billion, 70 billion. So, would there be incremental CapEx if you were to get to a 100 billion capacity by end of 2018 and should we take that into consideration just from a CapEx for a '18 perspective?","Jacek Olczak","Well, there won't be impact on the CapEx in '18. We have not announced the number of the CapEx for '18. So, we have to wait a bit, till the thing which we have. The Greek numbers, which your or number for the Greece conversion, Greek factory conversion is included in my 1.6 for this year as CapEx impact on the cash flow. And then I guess we will have other factory conversions, the capacity expansion capacities, which we'll be announcing as the year unfolds, in order to build up that 100 billion.","Okay, because always is the question of the machinery and equipment and is obviously the questions where we're going to host and when we're going to locate that manufacturing capacity; especially we're thinking in a context of converting existing combustible assets.","Judy Hong","Alright, okay, thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, Olczak.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. I have a couple of quick questions on IQOS. Could you give us an update of from your test for platform two? I believe you were testing that in the first quarter and if so could you again give us an update on how that performed and any plans to roll that out?","Jacek Olczak","Bonnie, we remember, kept on these two many occasions. We haven\u2019t test platform two in the first quarter. We have said we're going to test it later this year.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","We have P3 and the P4 as well in some cities or in some locations. But we have not done this test yet.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. So, it's on task then to be tested this year still.","Jacek Olczak","Oh, right.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then question on your tax benefit for IQOS. I guess I'd like to better understand these tax benefits in the market share and so on average are you still seeing around a 20% benefit across all of these markets and then curious, what are the economics on IQOS in markets where there is no tax benefit. Could you still generate profits on IQOS that would be comparable to your combustible cig business?","Jacek Olczak","To my, first to think the IQOS lower talks on heat-not-burn category is by the first country-by-country but it would be better or a higher benefit than a 20%. I guess, Japan is in about plus\/minus 20% benefit. That's one. Second is, from my knowledge, frankly speaking, I don\u2019t recall a country in which we have commercialized about frankly speaking to commercialize in which the heat-not-burn category is not classified as a lower with a lower tax benefit.","Bonnie Herzog","Alright.","Jacek Olczak","I might be wrong, but I don\u2019t think so we have any single country to their market today, when we wouldn\u2019t have the when heat-not-burn wouldn\u2019t have a lower tax classification.","Bonnie Herzog","That's what I thought, Olczak. But what about a scenario where fast-forward several years where some of these governments might change the tax benefits which we can argue why that should be the case. But just let's think about a worst case scenario. So, I guess I'm trying to get a sense of in the economics on IQOS if you had no tax benefit. There must, help us understand that and how you think about that.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. Well, IQOS saw the HeatSticks are sold at a price of a premium segment, right, on the mark.","Bonnie Herzog","Right.","Jacek Olczak","So, that\u2019s even excluding the tax benefit, we are premiumizing our portfolio and we're operating with the positive mix product mix category territory. Secondly, as we roll out and build up the capacity, we also are gradually lowering the cost of the manufacturing. So, as we have said from the very beginning of our journey in this new category, we would one should expect that one day the consumerable the HeatSticks will be manufactured at the very close unit cost to the conventional cigarette.","So, I have a cost approaching the conventional cigarette and I am operating at the margin level of the premium segment. So, would be equal if I would have a rapid expansion of the Marlboro volumes across the geographies. So, at least from a mix perspective, I am better off. At this margins clearly market-by-market are better than my other profit margins or unit margins on my entire portfolio.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, that's helpful. Okay, and then just a last quick question, certainly your conversion rates with IQOS and HeatSticks has been very high, which is great, but I'm curious to hear about trial. How is that been building in some of your IQOS markets in terms of just essentially recruiting new users to try this technology?","Jacek Olczak","Well, okay, I mean Japan is clear that the trial is frankly speaking limited because it build the factor of how many devices we allow the trade to sell. So, this trial is -- the number doesn't exist in a sense. I mean, there are the line of people a waiting list for the devices in many shelfs. So, the trial is people are buying and getting the device.","In other markets, frankly speaking the trial rates are about the same as we had mid-term in Japan. In a sense, when we went to from a 60% coverage to the national expansions, you remember we have lifted the trial rates and we have lifted the conversion rates and all of the markets and most of the market where we are now with like or say enjoying about the same at the same statistics and the same leading KPI view if you like.","Remember that the trial, that the product which we selling other our selloff through our selected trade partners is only for adult smokers. Right. So, we don\u2019t have that much interest if at all from the non-smokers but by the other all the roles of conversion, the product is only allowed to be sold to adult. It's obvious because it's a tobacco nicotine containing product but also only to the smokers.","And that's also important for us that we don\u2019t create an unintended consequences of when it comes to people who successfully quit smoking or people who never smoked before.","Bonnie Herzog","Right, okay. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you. So, I'm a little bit confused about your attitude towards market share in the conventional business. When I look at the sequential market share, so I'm looking at the market share you place in Q1 versus what you placed in Q4. Outside Europe, you've seen declines in pretty much every geography that you've list in the press release. As in my question, but which is worrying to me, the listeners who've attended your prepared remarks, you imply that this is roughly in line with expectations are not a big concern.","So, am I wrong to read that there has been a decline sequentially since 4Q outside Europe? And my how concerned are you about the market share trends in conventional?","Jacek Olczak","Adam, I very gladly has to unconfuse you.","Adam Spielman","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","We will have to go geography-by-geography and how we look at this trends. If I take the significant market share erosions which we observed, one obvious comes for example, Philippines; very sizeable market and we have a total significant share losses and it obviously waits on a total PMI of volume and a share performance.","But we have highlighted very much that instead of protecting low margin volumes in absence of the proper law enforcement when it comes to compliance with regards to the tax takers, we just about two years ago changed the strategy and what goes on managing the more growth, the price reduction of the price gap and so far the strategy is very successful.","Marlboro grows significant market share despite the fact that there is some down trading in the market. And secondly, we in a double-digit bottom digit, bottom line policy either of territory. Then you have some markets where the trends okay Indonesia is as we know is the continuous shift between the hand roll to machine made etcetera.","I mean, that in the recent launches which we have made in the machine made segment including the Marlboro Black kretek, which quarter in a market and not in a full even distribution has achieved the very strong 1% market share. So, that by Indonesian standard is very strong. And also both the initiatives etcetera. I think so far there goes well.","While we grow the markets share Indonesia, I mean, that remains to be seen. Can flood the market share, I feel as well positive about this one. That that's the large markets, we done a short fluctuations of share erosions matter for PMI. Then you have the market which you have typical sort of a Q1 distortion which are driven by the price increase patterns, which is take the Mexico, you take another in just as the timing of the price increases may change year-on-year, makes up a different purchasing pattern by the trade and therefore you might have this fluctuation.","Now, we are watching carefully the performance of the combustible business and we obviously as always watching very carefully the markets are perform. I have mentioned other performance in Italy and I call it off as that\u2019s going be going to stay for a while because there is a structural problem with the market, is a pretty wide price gap, lack of effective tax solutions at the bottom of the market.","On a compound, temporarily I hope with the elimination of the packs of 10 cigarette, it's obviously Marlboro has some quite significant exposure in that part of the market. Spain, okay, it's always when you cross their price points, you need to softer for a couple of quarters until -- either the market takes the next pricing the consumer has adjusted let's say.","On the other hand I have a very high priced Marlboro in France, and continues to grow. So, I hope that on my at least partially help to unconfuse you.","Adam Spielman","And just with, first of all thank you because you have. And second of all just to sort of throw the comments forward. You say that in the full-year even I expect to see -3% and -4% volume declines on a total basis. My guess is that's going to be how can we put it. It is going to be somewhat weak in the second quarter and gradually improved to that -3% to -4% both I'm guessing is conventional business is less paired and as the HeatSticks picks up. Is that how we should think about it sequentially?","Jacek Olczak","We should have, well, maybe I'll turn it to the other. And I think as of Q2, we should expect a much more robust revenue growth which is a combination of a pricing better volume makes which frankly speaking we didn\u2019t talk about the mix plus a 50 in the quarter by mixing the Q1 much better or much lower than the mixing in the Q1 last year. So some of the \u2013 as I said as of Q2 we should see much stronger volume sort of revenue growth on the rate to as I said to achieve that of 6% for the full year net of currency revenue growth.","Adam Spielman","And can I ask if a very quick follow up somewhat technical question. when you quote Q6 market share in Europe I\u2019m thinking about in Italy and Switzerland for example, is this off-take market share or is this shipment market share?","Jacek Olczak","This will be off take market share. It depends on the market we state are available but we usually refer to what we call market sales, so it\u2019s not asked to the distributor but is distributor sales. It may not in our markets be of the retail but to retail now depends.","Jacek Olczak","I understand, thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jeffery.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Just a question on \u2013 it looks like your volumes from fourth quarter to first quarter grew by around 20%, but your revenues by more like 2016\/17 can you just touch on what\u2019s driving that acceleration and what\u2019s giving them the mix lift. Is it countries, growth now in countries with a bigger tax benefits, or is it more, is it driven by more devices outside Japan, what\u2019s happening on the margin there?","Jacek Olczak","There could be some distortion from the devices, but as we said for the full year 16, when we\u2019re announcing full year results, I mean, roughly, devices in the RRPs related revenues should account for about 20, 22% somewhere in this range. So it might have a bit of higher shipment of the devices. But I wouldn\u2019t look at this purely from the quarterly perspective because there are different services obviously applies and we\u2019ve to start shipping more devices in order to follow this order to higher shipments of the heat sticks. So you\u2019ll always will some distortion there.","On the IMS basins and maybe go back to appropriate question before, on IMS basis by recall the shipments of, at least in Japan, sorry, an IMS basin the sales, in Japan, quarter-on-quarter grew about 30% and then what we see is about, if there is any distortions in the revenues presumably more from other location and devices.","Michael Lavery","Okay that\u2019s helpful. And then just looking at Japan even on unadjusted for inventory movement basis and more so when adjusted taking at the cigarettes and the heat stick volume together at the category level it looks like there is positive growth, which is clearly better than historically it\u2019s been, are you seeing increased use educations or what do you think is driving some of that better toll momentum overall?\\\\","Jacek Olczak","I want to say that Japan, I think Japan is somewhere straightly in-line with the secular type of decline. So I think Japan is in the \u2013 in this 3% to 4% type of a decline altogether, I mean all the categories and I don\u2019t think in the longer term this should change ups and obviously any other changes to the market. But as we\u2019re today I mean, this is one should expect as a baseline for Japan total category should be some more I think in the range of 3% to 4%.","Now there is some, I think JT was taking some price increases on a C category, okay. They were relatively lower total share, but I think there might be some elasticity kicking in and always on a quarterly basis Japan numbers, you have to properly, one have to properly adjust for all the pipelining of the new product launches on a \u2013 it\u2019s always on a conventional business, but I think it still continues. There might be some comps as well when JT was taking \u2013 last year [indiscernible] as I said nothing today would indicate that the total category trend in Japan would be outside 3% to 4%--","Michael Lavery","Okay, thank you. And just one last follow up on capacity, I know you\u2019ve outlined a lot of things about that, if you clarify this one, forgive me if I missed it. But, I know you had been saying you expected to be off of capacity constraints at the end of Q1 that\u2019s now obviously been a few weeks. Are you still rationing devices in Japan or do you have the flood gates open or what is the right way to think about, where you sit today?","Jacek Olczak","We start shipping, we start slowly lifting the quotas for Japan as of Q2, but we will not be in a position to significantly lift it before Q3 \u2013 the devices because we\u2019re still catching up with the capacity of HeatStick. But capacity of HeatStick every month from the January, February, March, we\u2019re already increasing it, you can see this in our shipments and we\u2019re going to continue doing this for the whole year.","Michael Lavery","Okay, great, thank you very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, now we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s question and answer portion on today\u2019s call. I\u2019d hand the program back over to management for any additional remarks.","Nicholas Rolli","Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.","You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We remain confident that the fundamentals of our business are solid despite the difficult comparisons in the third quarter that we have previously discussed. We expect to achieve our annual organic volume growth target of 1% and adjusted diluted EPS growth in line with our mid- to long-term constant currency annual growth target for the full year 2012.","Today, we narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted earnings per share guidance to $5.12 to $5.18 compared to $4.85 in 2011. This guidance includes unfavorable currency of $0.23, a tax charge of $0.05 related to the closing of the U.S. federal income tax audit for the years 2004 to 2006 and $0.02 of asset impairment and exit costs.","Excluding the impact of currency, the aforementioned tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011. Let me remind you that if we exclude the $0.10 hurdle due to Japan in 2011, the growth rate would be even higher at 13.5% to 14.5%.","Our revised guidance also reflects the increased investments in marketing, sales and distribution, particularly in the Asia and EEMA regions.","Turning to our third quarter results. We posted our strongest-ever quarterly results this time last year with organic cigarette volume growth of 4.4% and adjusted diluted EPS up 33% on a currency-neutral basis. As expected, therefore, our third quarter results this year suffered from these very tough comparisons with organic cigarette volume down 1.3% and adjusted diluted EPS up only 5.8% on a currency-neutral basis.","Through the end of September this year, we have achieved strong results with organic cigarette volume up by 0.7%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, our net revenues and adjusted OCI have increased by 5.4% and 6.9%, respectively. Adjusted diluted EPS has grown on a currency-neutral basis by 10.9%.","Let me now move to the European Union where economic conditions continue to be very difficult. Unemployment continues to rise in the southern European countries, most notably Spain. Consequently, tax-paid cigarette volumes were down at a double-digit rate in the quarter in Greece, Spain and Italy, while in contrast, the decline in Germany was a much more moderate 2%. For the EU region as a whole, the decline was 7.5%, an improved trend compared to the second quarter, and down 6.5% through the first 9 months of the year. For the full year 2012, we still expect that cigarette industry volume will decline by about 6%.","A key component in the decline of the duty-paid cigarette market in Southern Europe has been adult smokers switching to lower-taxed fine cut products and to illicit cigarettes. This can be illustrated by Italy where the duty-paid cigarette industry volume declined by 10.1% during the third quarter, while fine cut grew by 41%. In addition, the incidence of nondomestic illicit trade for 2012 in Italy is expected to reach approximately 9%, up from an estimated 6.5% in 2011.","Our business performed very well in this difficult environment. Marlboro gained 0.8 points in the quarter to reach a cigarette market share of 23.5%. This was sufficient, along with the 0.4 share points gained by Philip Morris Selection, to more than offset the share decline of our traditional local brand, Diana. Overall, PMI's market share rose by 0.2 points to 53.2%. We are now also the leader in the fine cut category and doubled our share to 27.2% behind Chesterfield and the launch of Diana.","In Germany, where unemployment remains low, cigarette industry volume declined just 2% in the third quarter, while sales of fine cut products increased by 2.3%. These robust trends took place despite tax-driven retail price increases earlier this year and were due in part to a reduction in border sales.","Marlboro continued to gain share in the cigarette category in the third quarter, up 0.2 points to 21%. With L&M essentially stable at 10.2%, our overall cigarette market share was in line with 2011.","In the EU region as a whole, economic conditions will remain difficult until the issue of unemployment is tackled. In the third quarter, our cigarette shipments declined by 8.1% or 4.6 billion units, driven by the 7.5% decrease in the industry volume. Our fine cut volume in contrast increased by 15.2%. The drop in our cigarette volume can be in large part attributed to an increase in illicit trade, particularly in southern European countries where total tobacco smoking incidence levels have remained relatively stable.","We are very pleased by the performance of Marlboro in the quarter. In an obviously difficult environment for premium brands, Marlboro was able to expand its market share by 0.4 points to 18.4%. Marlboro's share grew not only in Germany and Italy but also in markets such as Belgium, Greece and across Central Europe, notably Poland.","L&M remained resilient despite a 0.2 share points decline to 6.5%, attributable to adult smokers up-trading to Marlboro in Greece and Poland. Chesterfield gained 0.3 points to reach 3.5%, reinforcing our overall position in the low-price segment. Overall, our cigarette market share remained stable at 38.1%, while we further expanded our position in fine cut, adding 0.6 points to reach a category share of 13.4%.","Across the EU region, our pricing remained strong, the latest increase having taken place this month in France. However, the positive pricing variance was insufficient to offset the volume decline. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency, were consequently down by 1.9% and 2.9%, respectively. This also reflects the continued investments behind our brands and field sales force. In the first 9 months of the year, adjusted OCI on the same basis has decreased by just 0.9%, and we remain confident that we should be able to achieve an increase in profitability, excluding currency, in the EU region for the full year 2012.","Our results in the Asia region were impacted by the difficult volume comparisons in Japan and Korea, where our shipments grew by 47.1% and 22.4%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2011. We also faced challenging comparisons in Indonesia, where we achieved a 22.5% volume increase in the third quarter of last year. Nevertheless, our volume this quarter in Indonesia grew by a further 13% as we continued to increase our share in this growing market.","Adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, grew by 1.2% in the Asia region during the quarter, this despite the unfavorable geographic mix. Improved profitability in Indonesia and higher pricing across the region more than offset the impact of lower volumes in Japan and Korea. Importantly, our market share in Korea has sequentially improved from the second to third quarter of this year and is at a higher margin following our price increase in February 2012.","Industry volume in Japan declined by 7.7% in the quarter compared to a very distorted third quarter last year when distributor and trade inventories had been replenished to ensure adequate stock levels following the event in Japan. Nevertheless, we still expect stable industry volume for the full year 2012.","PMI's market share of 27.5% in the third quarter reflects a continued positive trend for Marlboro, which increased its quarterly share sequential in 2012 to 12.5%. On a September year-to-date basis, PMI's market share of 27.8% remains nearly 3 share points higher than the level before the events unfolded in Japan last year.","However, we have witnessed unusually high levels of competitive product introductions, which have put pressure on our traditional brands, Lark and Philip Morris. We continue to develop our innovation pipeline and expect Marlboro's positive momentum to continue. For the full year, we are now expecting our market share to be slightly below our 2011 exit share of approximately 28%.","Our leading position and our strong share momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Market growth is expected to continue, driven by favorable demographics. In addition, improving consumer purchasing power is helping to drive up-trading, with the premium segment reaching a share of 27.4% in the third quarter compared to 24.9% a year ago.","In the third quarter, we witnessed a decline in the low-price segment, where retail selling prices have increased at a faster rate than in other price segments. As a result, combined with the anticipated enforcement of Decree 191 by the end of November, which will eliminate a tax loophole, we expect industry volume to grow in the range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2012.","Our volume increased by a further 13% in the third quarter, and market share grew by 3.3 points to 34.9%, with a particularly strong performance from premium-price Sampoerna A in the Kretek category and Marlboro in the white cigarette category.","Let me conclude the Asia region with an update on plain packaging. As you know, the Australian High Court ruled in August that the plain packaging legislation does not violate the Australian Constitution and on October 5 issued its reason.","In reaching a conclusion, 6 of the 7 High Court judges recognized that plain packaging deprives tobacco companies of valuable intellectual property. The conclusions of the High Court are significant for other governments considering plain packaging, as they demonstrate that plain packaging is a deprivation of property, something that we expect would raise serious questions about the legality of plain packaging legislation in other jurisdictions.","The ruling turned on the specific, if not unique, nature of the Australian Constitution, which provides broad powers to the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws but contains few protections for basic rights. Australian law is violated only if the government, as the taker of property, receives a proprietary benefit from that property. Despite the fact that the property was taken, the Court found that the government did not acquire the property because it did not receive such a proprietary benefit. By contrast, the law in Europe and other countries is different. For example, in contrast to the Australian Constitution, the Constitutions of the EU Member States generally contain strong protections for fundamental rights and place limits on the powers of central governments. A finding that manufacturers have been deprived of property would, in our view, amount to a violation of a number of EU and Member State laws.","Due to the scope of this specific case, the Australian High Court did not rule on whether plain packaging will reduce smoking prevalence or whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations.","The High Court ruling confirms that other ongoing international legal cases are strong and that the Australian government is at serious risk of having to pay substantial compensation in these cases or bring its plain packaging measures into conformity with international treaties or both.","Three countries have already initiated proceedings against Australia before the World Trade Organization on the ground that the plain packaging legislation is contrary to Australia's obligations as a WTO member. Philip Morris Asia is suing the Australian government for multiple breaches of its bilateral investment treaty with Hong Kong. Decisions in these cases are expected within 2 to 3 years. In broad terms, these cases will examine a number of issues, including whether there is any valid evidence that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates; whether there are effective, less restrictive alternatives that Australia could have implemented instead; whether plain packaging breaches Australia's international trade and treaty obligations; and whether the Australian government will need to pay compensation to Philip Morris Asia.","We believe that the international legal cases are strong, and there is still a long way to go before all the legal questions about plain packaging are fully explored and resolved.","Let me now move to the Latin America and Canada regions, which had solid share momentum in the third quarter. Although volume was down, we increased our share in the key markets of Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Marlboro was particularly strong across the region, with share up in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 10.5% in the third quarter.","The EEMA region was our strongest performance -- performer in the quarter, this despite a challenging comparison. Volume grew by 3% with continued strong business momentum in Russia and Turkey, as well as an improving market climate in Egypt. Higher volumes, a favorable mix and pricing in Russia and many other markets resulted in a growth in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 17.3%. This is the sixth consecutive quarter that our volume mix has been favorable in the EEMA region.","Russia was a key driver of our strong EEMA region performance, both in terms of volume and pricing. In July, we implemented a tax-driven RUB 3 per pack price increase. Along with lower revised estimates for industry volume in the first half of the year and higher prices in the market, industry volume is now expected to show a slight decline for the full year 2012.","Our volume in contrast increased by 4.5% in the quarter, thanks to our good share momentum, as well as some favorable inventory adjustments. Our Nielsen market share on a quarter and year-to-date basis through the end of August was 0.7 and 0.6 points higher at 26.5% and 26.2%, respectively. Parliament, Bond Street and Next have remained the key drivers of our stronger share performance. We are also pleased that L&M's turnaround is gaining momentum, with a 0.2 share point gain in the first 2 months of the quarter.","In Russia, the government approved amendments to the tax code at the end of September, including excise tax rates for the period 2013 to 2015. The government has reconfirmed the excise tax rates for cigarettes in 2013 and 2014 and extended the tax code to 2015, with an indexation of the specific excise tax set at 20%. The Duma will now review the code by mid-November, and we expect a final vote by year end.","On a year-to-date September basis, Marlboro grew share in all 4 regions, benefiting from a robust pipeline of innovative products. Marlboro's share increased notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Mexico and Poland. On a worldwide basis, excluding China and the U.S.A., the brand's share increased to 9.3%.","While we are pleased by Marlboro's strong performance, we are even more delighted by Parliament in the above premium segment. Parliament volume increased by 10.7% in the third quarter and by 9.4% so far this year. The brand has gained share year-to-date in 4 of its most important markets and is making inroads in newer markets. In Turkey, Parliament achieved a market share of 8.7%, representing a gain of 0.8 points August year-to-date.","We continued to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our September year-to-date share reached 37%. This is 0.4 points above our full year 2011 share and 1.5 points above our full year 2010 share.","The pricing environment continues to be favorable. This is highlighted by the $505 million in pricing variance that we achieved in the third quarter and the $1.3 billion year-to-date.","The combination of strong pricing, limited input cost increases and productivity savings has enabled us to continue to grow our superior adjusted OCI margin. On a PMI-wide basis, our adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency and acquisitions, reached 46.2%, a gain of 0.7 points in the first 9 months of the year.","On a September year-to-date basis, our free cash flow reached $7.1 billion. Compared to the previous year, free cash flow, excluding currency, was down $1.7 billion or 18.6%. The decrease was driven by higher working capital requirements, mainly related to finished goods forestalling and the planned replenishment of tobacco leaf and clove inventories. For the full year 2012, we expect that our free cash flow, excluding currency, will be down slightly and will not adversely impact our dividend and share repurchase programs.","Our confidence in the underlying strength of the business and our ability to continue to generate significant cash flow is reflected in the 10.4% increase in our dividend that was announced last month. Since the March 2008 spin-off, we have raised the dividend 5x, increasing the annualized dividend by almost 85% over the period.","We spent $1.5 billion to repurchase a further 16.7 million shares in the third quarter. Since the spin-off, we have now used almost $26 billion to repurchase nearly 467 million shares at an average price of $55.49. We continue to target spending of $6 billion this year.","In conclusion, the third quarter of 2012 was, as expected, a difficult quarter in terms of comparisons with last year's record third quarter.","Looking at our performance year-to-date through September, we remain confident that for the full year 2012, we should be able to deliver on our 1% organic volume annual growth target, driven by strong performances in the Asia and EEMA regions.","We narrowed the range of our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance to $5.12 to $5.18. Excluding the impact of currency, a tax charge and asset impairment and exit costs, our guidance implies a growth rate of approximately 11% to 12%.","Finally, we remain steadfast in our commitment to deliver superior returns to our shareholders evidenced by the fifth consecutive increase in our dividend since the spin and our $6 billion target for share repurchases this year.","Thank you, and I will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Jacek, so first, just in terms of guidance, I guess there's a lot of confusion just in terms of your guidance update. So if we look at the reported guidance now, $5.12 to $5.18, and compare that versus your prior guidance of $5.10 to $5.20, at the midpoint, it doesn't look like it's changed a whole lot, but you basically have taken the underlying guidance up, currency is a little bit more favorable. So can you just bridge the guidance kind of from $5.10 to $5.20 to $5.12 to $5.18, both underlying, in currency and et cetera?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. Yes, I think I'll start with our previous guidance, which was $5.10 to $5.20. And if you remember at that time, this guidance included the $0.27 of unfavorable currency versus the 2011. Our new guidance assumes the $0.23 of unfavorable currency, again versus 2011. So we have a gain of $0.04 on the currency. Also, in our previous guidance, we did not have the impact of the tax charge of the $0.05 related to the closing of the U.S. tax of this and the $0.01 for the asset impairment and exit costs. So it gives me a $0.06 or gives us a $0.06 of adjustment, if you like. So if I have a $0.05 adjusted for better currency or $0.04, adjusted for the tax charge negative $0.06, I am at the -- we were at the $5.08 to $5.18, which we narrowed upward, if you like, to the $5.12, $5.18. And this should imply a growth rate on x currency basis of approximately, as we said, 11% to 12% versus the adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in the previous year. And I think it's clear -- it should be clear now.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So when you think about 2013 and you think about your long-term growth target of 10% to 12% growth, would you be targeting to grow off of the $5.12 to $5.18 or the $5.18 to $5.24?","Jacek Olczak","One, for this year, would be $5.18 to $5.24. Actually, you should say $5.19 to $5.25, just not to further complicate the issue. We have the $0.01 of adjustment in the first 2 quarters of the year and the $0.01 extra of the adjustment for the [indiscernible] in the third quarter. So to be perfectly accurate, I should say it's $5.19 to $5.25.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Which is the base that you would target the 10% to 12% off for next year?","Jacek Olczak","That's right. That's correct.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of EU, Jacek, so it sounds like you're expecting some recovery in fourth quarter just versus what you've been seeing year-to-date. So can you just walk us through kind of why you're thinking that you do get some nice bounceback in fourth quarter to kind of get to that full year down 6% for EU?","Jacek Olczak","I think it's partially due to the comps which we expect for the Q4 this year versus Q4 last year. We've had a very bad or very low quarter driven by some timing of the pricing tax changes in the last year. So we expect this to ease the pressure for this year. And also, we see how the end of the quarter 3, which was very low, sorry, quarter 2, which was very low for the EU, and then how quarter 3 we closed. I think this gives us the confidence that we should be in a range of 6%, even, I would say, marginally, the volumes for the total market in EU may go a little bit below 6% or let's say 6% [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My first question is on Japan. As you discussed, you've put a lot of new products in the market. So could you talk about how you're balancing this innovation while maintaining strength with some of your core brands in the country? And also, could you give us more color on the competitive pressures and how you see this playing out next year, such in light of Japan Tobacco's plans to change their Mild Seven brand name?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. As we said or I said in our remarks, we're very pleased with the performance of Marlboro, which not only is obviously about the level, which it had before the special situations in Japan. But also, sequentially, the quarter this year, [ph] Marlboro has a higher share. Our focus since the beginning of the year was essentially primary on Marlboro. So 4 out of 5 of the big year initiatives which we have deployed into the market were behind Marlboro, 2 behind Marlboro Ice Blast and 2 behind Marlboro Edge. The most growing or the most dynamic segment today in Japan is around menthol, super slim propositions and sometimes with the capsules -- with the menthol capsules. And this is exactly what we're pushing behind Marlboro. JT, because this I was referring mainly as the competitor deploying quite a large amount of new initiatives in the market, seems that they took a little bit of a different approach because this was broadly on the entire portfolio. So clearly, there are some brands which are more on the traditional spectrum of the consumers, and hence, the losses which we incurred in the quarter of this year are more on our traditional brands which is Lark. So Marlboro is in a very good shape. I think the innovations behind Marlboro [indiscernible] this year and what we have in the pipeline for the next year, I think we are in good shape. It's more of the fact that the focus of JT and the deploying number of innovations there and our share is a little bit below the 28% exit share. Now with regards to [indiscernible] and the Mild Seven, it's difficult for me to comment a competitor's move. It is clearly a very bold and a bright move and create some challenges presumably for JT and create, I would argue, some opportunities for others. So let's see how this thing is going to unfold in the market.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I have another question, and it would be on Russia. How are you guys going to manage the scenario where there likely will be increased regulations, smoking bans and then taxes? What are your expectations for consumption in the market and consumer behavior, if these proposals are enacted? And then could you give us just a little bit more color on the progress you're making with Marlboro in Russia?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. So on our tax in Russia, I think, first, we're very pleased that the Russian government continues with this 3-year tax outlook. I mean, we always -- I think it is good from a government perspective when they heard the news and also from the industry that large perspective to have a 3-year tax visibility, adding the 2015, clarifying what rates they would like to have, is very helpful. Now that's clearly -- there will be a substantial target increase in the 2013, '14 and '15, but something which we planned or you could say we anticipated. So I think at the end of the day, it's going to turn manageable on the tax side. On the regulatory side, I'll discuss just for us also to understand, it still needs to be approved by Duma. This is not the final thing, but this is what we know at this point in time. In terms of the regulatory, okay, they have 3 issues or the 3 subjects which they want to cover for the regulatory to understand today the cabinet approved, and they moved it now to Duma for Duma debate. There's a smoking ban for the [indiscernible] sector, the [indiscernible], which I think they target in 2015 as implementation. So it's not 2013 or 2014, it's '15. And the workplaces ban, which is 2013, i.e., next year. Then you have some restrictions on sales in the outlets below the 50 square meters. So that clearly will have some impact on our volume allocations between a trade channel and the experience from other markets is that this -- it makes it a little bit more [indiscernible] for consumers to walk a few extra 100 meters to the next shop but doesn't impact the smoking rate of consumption, as is potentially the smoking ban because if I go to the more mature market where most of the countries in the planet who have in the work who have a smoking ban, you have an impact of a 1% to 2% at the beginning of the implementation, and then the market moderated, sometimes even comes back to the previous level. So I think it is overall pretty manageable situation, but we need to assume that Russia is moving into the total market performance when you're serving a more mature country. So maybe 1%, maybe 2% part of the total industry decline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First, Jacek, could you help me understand the magnitude of the negative effect you had in the Asian division from the year-ago increase in trade inventories?","Jacek Olczak","I think you're referring mostly to Japan.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, in Japan.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. The Japan situation was like this. We had -- what we announced at the end of the year, we had a hurdle or what we call the hurdle in Japan, the 6.3 billion units of the equivalent, what we said, the $0.10 on EPS. And this was related to the hurdle which we had in the second quarter, mainly in the second quarter of last year, okay, due to the higher end market sales and the higher market share. What we have been confronted with in the third quarter of last year is that, obviously, following the high sales in the second quarter, we ended up with extremely low inventories of trade level. And we have to replenish this inventory to the safety level, and that's essentially when the distortions come through. And if you would do the quantification of this thing, I think that the adjustment would be the range of, say, about the 1 trillion units, okay, of Philip Morris. So you're talking about the distortions which we have to pay, i.e., we have to replenish inventories to the safety level.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then secondly, Jacek, in the EU, I mean, you obviously have -- had run that division. What's the midterm outlook for Philip Morris in the EU? Do you think it's reasonable that for the foreseeable future, that you can maintain local currency operating income? Do you think that, that's an ambitious objective? Or do you think despite the economic situation of the unemployment levels and so forth, you can continue to eke out a little bit of growth over time?","Jacek Olczak","Okay, listen, we managed to maintain, if not actually we expect that we even can slightly grow the profitability on a net currency basis this year. So yes, it is ambitious. Obviously, there was a huge effort. You see how what we believe was Marlboro and how it nicely [indiscernible] OTP segment. So obviously, we're trying to manage and mitigate the impact of the crisis. Now until you see the improvement on unemployment side very much in the south of Europe because this right here is performance of the entire EU, and I hardly can see how the situations can improve. But we are currently in a crisis, I'm talking Philip Morris, and we'll manage the situations pretty well. So unless there are any shocking type of excise increases, which we don't see today at all, I think the situation is very challenging and we all know it, but I think it's manageable.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Two other quick things, Jacek. The resignation of the EU health minister, do you think that's going to have any effect on the outcome or the timing of the pending update of the tobacco products directive?","Jacek Olczak","Listen, already, EU should be today after the interservice consultation, okay? There was some delays before the departure of Mr. Dalli. I mean, we have learned about this new development, the sudden departure. Listen, we just hope that EU Commission will have a transparent evidence-based process while reviewing this directive, but at this stage, we do not know how the departure of Mr. Dalli will impact the timing of the strategic review. This is a development of the last couple of days.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Jacek, on working capital, is the build -- or the use of cash flow for inventories and so forth this year, is that a one-off phenomenon? Is that going to be a negligible number next year? Or will there be a working capital build next year in all likelihood as well, but it will be considerably less than this year? Or do you envision a similar level of incremental use of cash for working capital next year?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. There are 3 elements which are the 3 key drivers behind the working capital development this year. One is the [indiscernible] inventory, right, and that is a variable which depends on the timing and the level of the tax price changes. So that will remain but I can't give you the marketing figures because this we don't know, frankly speaking. The 2 others is the inventory of leaf, level of inventory of leaf and inventory of clove. And here, the situation is a little bit different because we had a very high level of sales also driven by Japan last year, and now the inventory has to be adjusted, okay, because we finished the inventories in 2011 at a little bit lower level because we used that leaf in our cigarettes which we sold last year. We continue with the high volume this year, and you see that we're shooting still at a 1% organic volume growth target. So we'll continue [indiscernible] inventory, which is a good thing because I'm using this to support myself. Clove is a little bit different thing because there is a cyclical clove, and this year, I have a very high clove at a much more attractive prices than the previous year. So I have no choice, actually, we're going to be doing what everyone should do, we have to buy clove once it is in the big supply, at the right prices, okay? So clove presumably may ease a little bit next year, but the rest, we'll have to see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","If I could follow up on the question on the European Union Tobacco Products Directive. Is there any clearer sense, I understand the timing issue, but in terms of what we should be expecting as major initiatives embedded within that? And then secondly, on the Philippines, I noted the market share losses and the citation that, that was driven by Champion and Hope. I wonder if you could talk about what happened there, and then secondarily, the prospects for the tax law change given the changes in the Senate and the various options going on there.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. Erik, on the TPD, as I answered the previous question, I mean, it's hard to say today what the outcome in terms of the timing is going to be. We have not much of a visibility, what is in a draft directive. As I said, the interservice consultation should have already been at the end, and it has not started yet. So clearly, the idea of the proposal attracts the local attentions, and therefore, the draft proposal is not issued yet. So we have to just be patient and wait for this one. Moving to Philippines, yes, we had to think about the 2 points of the market share loss in the quarter in Philippines that's driven by the low price or bottom of the market. We had some pressure from, I think, one of the competitors. You know that there are some distortions due to the fact that some competitors are touching the prices, which is difficult to reconcile if somebody would pay the full excise. But I think there was a bit of a tax loophole or that sort of a nature problem. We have adjusted in some regions, I think, the price of Champion. So we're defending our position. But other than that, we're doing okay. I mean, Marlboro was up, Fortune was up. So I think that's the only problem which we have. With regards to the tax, I think the Senate just now or next week goes into recess. I don't think the Senate has yet issued or concluded with their bill, depends on how much the Senate will be different to the House of Representatives bill. They will have a bicameral conference committee when they will reconcile the differences. I think we'll wait until the end of November to have a tax visibility for Philippines.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then with respect to the Swedish match JV, I understand that the JV is now in Israel. Could you comment on what that market offers in terms of additional understanding of consumers and what the prospects are also in St. Petersburg?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. So we have, I think, a further market with the joint venture where we're testing the product. We're trying to understand what is the right way of marketing that product to drive down to consumers. The whole behavioral part of this, et cetera. I think it's a mid-, long-term project. So I wouldn't go into the specifics of each individual product. It's a step-by-step learning culture from all this category.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Fell of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I'm just wondering if you could delve a little bit more into Italy. I'm sorry, the line wasn't that good. But first of all, did you say that illicit trade had picked up from about 6.5% to 9%? Was that the correct figure?","Jacek Olczak","Was that correct figure.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So we've got a 2% or 3% legal market decline stemming from that. What sort of shift out of factory-made cigarettes, would that fine cut growth have caused?","Jacek Olczak","Well, the fine cut growth, we said, by about 40% -- about the 40%. I think about half of the volume decline in Italy would be due to the price elasticity, and the half would be somehow almost equally distributed between the fine cut and illicit trade. We will have to zoom in into the geography in Italy because there was a lot of growth on the contraband in the south of Italy. The accounts now which last year had a contraband below 10%, and this year, they have 50%. I mean, obviously, I can throw you the names of Naples and Palermo. That is what is happening there. And also -- yes, but that's about, I think would be 1\/3 of the first distribution of the losses, if you like, in income. About half is what we developed specifically, and the remaining cause in equal parts would be about illicit trade and the fine cut.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And can you just give us a rough idea of what the annual increase in prices has been in Italy third quarter versus third quarter last year?","Jacek Olczak","I would have to go -- okay, this year, I think we had March EUR 0.10, EUR 0.10 per pack, and this last year, you had September EUR 0.20 and July EUR 0.10. So I think year-on-year basis [indiscernible] to finish at the end of this quarter, you had a 4% price increase on a year-to-date basis.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And what's a pack of Marlboro now in Italy? About EUR 6?","Jacek Olczak","Yes.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Okay. I can work that out later on.","Jacek Olczak","EUR 5.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","EUR 5. Okay. And then -- I mean, in terms of the rough breakdown of those effects illicit in OTP, are we talking something pretty similar in Spain, basically?","Jacek Olczak","Yes. It's a different stage of the market because Spain is longer in the crisis, but again, you have a growth over illicit trade, I think, comparable development and the growth of the fine cut.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Jacek, can you elaborate a little bit on your views about slowdown of economies in Asia, in particular, and what impact that could have on market volume growth on up-trading versus down-trading on your ability to take pricing?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, okay. I mean, I think the biggest slowdown is what I remediate in China. So for the time being, that impacts us directly. But you take -- and as you look into Indonesia, okay, there's a slowdown. I mean, they still expect the economy to grow 6%, 6.5%, highest, I think, consumer confidence, moderate inflation. So Indonesia, which is a big market for us, I don't think we have any sort of the headwinds there. Philippines, okay, we have this open tax issue, but other than that, I think the underlying economy is not doing that bad. As I said, I mean, I don't want to downplay what we read, but I think it's much more coming from China. And China, as I said, for the time being, does not have that much of an impact on us.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And you don't see any risk that China could spill over into other Asian emerging markets as well?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I'm -- I see the forecast today. As I said, the big large market for us, Philippines, Indonesia. Okay, Japan is a different story. But even in Japan this year, following the distortions, et cetera, we estimate about a [indiscernible] market. I think we should do okay. In Indonesia, we think the market is going to grow in the range 6% to 7%. I think earlier this year, we talked about the 8%. Actually, if I look at the composition of the mix in the market, because there is a lot of up-trading, I think the value of the market grows better with a 6% to 7% volume and growth assumption that was 8%, which we had previous. So not today. I mean, today, I don't think...","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in Japan, it seems like Japan Tobacco has been, for lack of a better word, out-innovating you for 2 or 3 quarters now. Do you expect JT -- at what point do you expect JT to slow down their innovations? Or at what point would you have to step up your innovations for the market?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I don't think -- I wouldn't say that they're over-innovative. I mean, I think there is not that they have an innovation in terms of the benefit of offer to their smoker which is better than ours. I wouldn't say it like this. It is just the number of the launches which they did in the last 3 quarters, not on the quality, more on the quantity. I think -- listen, I'm not in the shoes of JT. I can't comment on this, and they will stop launching more products.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But right now, you don't see any need for you to change your innovation approach in Japan?","Jacek Olczak","No. I mean, we still have -- we've just launched this week, I believe, Virginia Slims, so we know we're moving through other brands where we have a pipeline. A pipeline of initiatives is also preferred. But I think each of these initiatives has to be launched properly into the market, and we need the time to work it with the consumer. [indiscernible] crucial period of time, in the long run, it is not Philip Morris [indiscernible].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just had a couple of questions for you, if I could, and they're mostly just follow-ups. I want to ask you a quick follow-up on Japan which is, what's the underlying decline rate you expect for that market this year? If you said that, I missed that. I'm sorry.","Jacek Olczak","No, for this year, I think we estimate the market to be flat versus last year. So I think with our estimate, the market should close at about 195 billion, 196 billion units.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So therefore, the decline this quarter was not unique or different from what you expected.","Jacek Olczak","No, because you had, as I said, I think there was this replenishment of inventories, which I quantified for us to be about 1 billion, and I think on the total market, the estimate would be in the range of 3 billion, the third quarter last year. So I think if you factor this in, you will come to the -- more of the normal situation.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I want to ask about Russia. There was a comment about some inventory movements this quarter. And then -- so just -- is there a way to quantify how much maybe that helped your shipments in the quarter? And then related to that, I know you've had a better share there. It's coming from brands other than Marlboro. And I know you have some new products behind Marlboro. So just curious if you could comment on that and just kind of the state of Marlboro in Russia.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. I think the impact on the shipment was, I said, coming from inventories, but we also have a very strong share growth in Russia, okay? And this is behind all brands, not at this stage by Marlboro. Now Marlboro, we have launched ClearTaste, I mean, the extensions of Marlboro family into the ClearTaste. But I think on Marlboro, maybe I should put it like this. Marlboro is, for us, a midterm journey. We have 3 issues which we have to continue addressing with regards to the Marlboro underperformance versus our standards in Russia, one is the premiumness of Marlboro, which we're trying to correct with pricing Marlboro higher than it used to be. So the last 2 price increases, Marlboro actually took a bit more of the price increase that was the increase in the market. Second thing is Marlboro has an issue of harsh perception, and this is what we're addressing as we speak with the launch of the Marlboro ClearTaste. And the third one is the more modernity side of Marlboro, and we continue this with our marketing programs in place. I think we're making good progress, but in order to claim that we have a sustainable growth of Marlboro in Russia, I think we need to be a little bit patient. And we are patient.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I have one final question for you, and that's just, in relation to the EU region, it's going to be your third year of roughly 5% to 6% declines in volume. And I guess it's difficult to predict the state of Southern Europe and some of those countries. Looking ahead, whether it be 1 year -- or 1 to 3 years, is the -- obviously, the risk in those markets where you've had this increase in illicit trade, such that you could continue to see those kind of declines in the EU region overall. I guess my question is just related to the illicit trade, if that's becoming a -- obviously, a larger and larger issue in some of these markets.","Jacek Olczak","Well, listen, I mean, every single government is getting focused or has the right focus now on the illicit trade. These guys were living with the consequences of, in some countries, high tax increases in the past and also the sudden erosion of the consumer purchasing power because all these austerity measures dented what the consumer has in their pocket. I think I said in the remarks, if I look in Germany, when we see the market's doing very well, I mean, quarter 3 was pretty strong and we're still looking for the full good year of total industry volumes in Germany, I think that's partially because the illicit trade comes back at least to some extent to the legal market. So I think what we confronted today in the south of Europe, one day, this volume, at least to some extent, will come back to the fast-paced volumes, to the industry volume. But as I said, I mean, unless you see the improvement on the unemployment side, I don't think we should be betting on any sudden improvement in Europe.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you just let us know if there was any news in Turkey with regards to the excise tax reform?","Jacek Olczak","No. Well, the only news which we had is that, I think, the government has already increased taxes on alcohol, cigarette and some other categories. So frankly speaking, I would expect announcement of a tax increase or tax change in Turkey somewhere before the year end or at the very beginning of the next year. You know that the government have received the authorization from the Parliament to amend this specific component. This will be first time historically when Turkey would have a statutory component, but we need still see the announcement of the government.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the one question about France. Could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on the outlook? I appreciate that Marlboro has been obviously impacted by crossing the EUR 6 per pack price, but any thoughts on the market would be appreciated.","Jacek Olczak","Well, the market, I think, for the quarter was down about -- a little bit less than 5%, 4.5% [indiscernible] 6%. Year-to-date, I think the market is about 4.2% down. We now have the price increase of the EUR 0.40 for Marlboro went from a EUR 6.20 to EUR 6.60. But the low-priced cigarettes went from the EUR 5.70 to EUR 6. But somehow this psychological price point barrier is removed, but other prices are higher in the market. So I think Marlboro had more of the pressure being round about the EUR 6. This is somehow removed. But the whole prices are higher in the market, so we see how we deal with those. I feel about some austerity measures in France taking place and so on. So I think we need to see how that market realizes and what impact it will have.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's good. And just one final question about Ukraine. I understand there was some trade inventory movements in the quarter, but I was just wondering if trading conditions in Ukraine sequentially have changed relative to the first half.","Jacek Olczak","I think there were some distortions due to the Q3 2011 in Ukraine. So the market was looking, I think, 10% lower in Q3 this year, but I think it was very much driven by some distortions in the Q3 2011. I think on a year-to-date basis, presumably, I did a better number for Ukraine, 3.5%. And I think we estimate that the full year will be in a range of about 3%, full year total industry volumes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to circle back to the Philippines. While I recognize it's still early in terms of the legislation that's coming out of the Senate and the House in terms of the excise taxes, I was curious if you could at least comment on the price elasticities in that market and how they compare to other emerging markets.","Unknown Executive","Price elasticity.","Jacek Olczak","Well, the market, total market, I mean, this year, I think we estimate the full year total market will actually cost 100 billion units. I think we estimate like 101 billion units. So this would represent fairly close to the 3% growth of the market. I mean, there is a price increase we took in the market. Today, I mean, the elasticities will be in a range which you've seen are replacements. If you ask me the question, how we see that same towards the tax implementation, then I need to know what is the tax which final will be implemented there. So there's a little bit of a speculation at this stage. So I don't know if we're answering the question. This year, I think the market will grow in the range of up to 3%. This is our estimate.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And in terms of the EU, given the outsized growth that you saw in other tobacco products, while those are definitely lower margin, I was curious, at least directionally, what your organic profit growth would have looked like on just a cigarette basis.","Jacek Olczak","Because we're entering the fine cut, because consumers have preferences for usage of cigarette brand. I mean, there has been [indiscernible] very rapid share advancements in this category. The fine cut has a lower unit profitability than a cigarette, but it is also a [indiscernible] tax structure. The government -- some government are looking into restructuring of the tax and the fine cut, et cetera. So, I mean, it's an important element. It's becoming an important element not in terms of our profitability but overall [indiscernible] service which we're delivering to the customers. This is how we look at that thing. Part of this volume, I also think, will one day come back to the manufacture of cigarettes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess can you talk a little bit about EEMA pricing? Obviously, pricing was good, but margins really took a jump. I understand you took the price increase in Russia, but is there anything else in there that would have driven pricing and margin up that significantly? And can, I guess -- could you talk a little bit about the sustainability of these margins? Because I think they're the highest on a quarterly basis anyway we've seen in a while.","Jacek Olczak","I think we've had some pricing in Ukraine as well. So it's not just the Russia, which drives the -- Turkey, so it's not just Russia and EEMA which drives the price. And sustainability of the [indiscernible], yes, I think, as in general, we say that the pricing environment is manageable, favorable and we have seen how much we had a pricing variance year-to-date on a global basis, and I think that thing's going to continue.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess one quick thing on the EU, right? I mean, I think you've been clear that without unemployment getting fixed, that market continues to decline. And I guess can you just talk about the ability to continue time-after-time to generate that 1% volume growth for the total company with an EU drag of 6%? I mean, can you just put a little color around your ability to keep doing that?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think that this year's going to be the perfect testimony that this is achievable because we have a year when we predict the total industry volumes to go down by 6%. And despite even the difficult comps in Asia, we say that the PMI can deliver 1% organic volume growth target. I think the engine in EEMA and Asia are working at the full throttle. They can cover up for the challenging environment which we unfortunately have in Europe. I feel pretty okay about it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Avery of CLSA.","Michael Avery","I just wanted to touch on illicit trade. I know you've outlined the size of that opportunity in a lot of markets, but it seems like it rarely goes down. It did in Turkey this quarter. What were some of the drivers there? Is there any color you can give on what would have helped that?","Jacek Olczak","Well, as far as the government focus, and it's not just the Ministry of Finance, the Customs authorities, but there's, as I understand, a number of ministries and the state agencies which finally sat together and decided to do something about it. And to their credit, they did a phenomenal job. I think the situations or the tensions in the Turkey\/Syria border also helping a little bit, okay? There was obviously more intensity of the border controls, et cetera, so that's other key driver. I think the government which seems to be committed to address the issue of the contraband on the Syria border.","Michael Avery","Okay. And then back to Russia, I know we've covered a lot of stuff here. I just want to make sure I understand exactly what you were saying. If the tax increase is approved by the Duma as it stands now and as it's written, are you saying that, that would be manageable? Or would you characterize that as a disruptive tax increase? Or just at least looking from this year to next, what's the magnitude of that, in your opinion?","Jacek Olczak","Well, the magnitude of this thing in terms if it stays as it's proposed by the government now, then next year, this will translate into the platform [indiscernible] platform of, I think, RUB 6. And thereafter about RUB 9. If you take the pricing in Russia, and you take the inflation, it is an increase, it is not a minor increase. As I said, I think, a substantial but manageable. But this is not a [indiscernible] increase.","Michael Avery","And so the positive is obviously that it's laid out over a multi-year progression and you'd have the predictability. But how big of a risk do you see for next year if that goes through as proposed now?","Jacek Olczak","Well, this is a second year in a row when we have a 3-year tax visibility. So I think we did more government, not only Russia, going for that sort of an approach. I have Germany, I have other places where they want to see their 3, 4, 5 years tax outlook set that way, and that clearly demonstrates the results are a benefit for the government.","Michael Avery","Okay. And then one last question, a little different. I know at the Analyst Day, you laid out a lot of great stuff about the next-generation products, but clearly, it takes a little bit of time to commercialize those and get the approvals that you're looking for. Given the success of e-cigarettes in the U.S., would you consider doing -- putting those in the market anywhere? I know you were clear about how the nicotine delivery is nowhere near as comparable. But to the extent that there seems to be a consumer acceptance at least in the market here, would that change how you think about doing that as maybe sort of an interim step?","Jacek Olczak","No. Listen, our strategy is very clear on this one. We want to commercialize this product, but with a claim. So I need the regulatory approval to allow me to say what the product which we have, one of the 3 platforms which we're working on, can provide in terms of a benefit to a consumer. So we don't want to make a shortcut on this one. I launched the product which we have but without that being able to make the claim. I think that's very important.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about pricing which year-to-date has been a strong contributor to results. And how should we think about the pricing lever for fiscal '13?","Jacek Olczak","One I am afraid I can't share it with you. But, historically, if you look at since the spin -- since the spinoff, I mean, our pricing variance was in the range of $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion, and I think we don't see that much of a headwind. So pricing stays in target, and it will remain very important component of our growth model.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Perfect. And then if we think about marketing spending and brand support, are there any changes in that strategy either by market or by brand as you look out the next couple of months? Anything you can comment on?","Jacek Olczak","No. We continue spending. Listen, we have a great growth volume and a share momentum last year, this year and also behind the Marlboro and of our premium Parliament, and I think it's very wise to continue that spending. So we're going to continue, even in tough environment like EU or other places.","Operator","I would now like to return the call to management for any closing remarks.","Nicholas Rolli","Well, thank you very much for joining us.

[Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. ","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the third quarter of 2015 and comparing them to the same period in 2014 unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations as well as reconciliations to US GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides which are posted on our website.","Reduced risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer the products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for review the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","My pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. ","Our strong performance in the first half of the year continued in the third quarter. Organic cigarette volume declined by a modest 1.5% reflecting global cigarette industry volume primarily in the Asia region partly offset by market share gains mainly in the EEMA region and Latin America and Canada region. The cigarette volumes of Marlboro and L&M our two largest brands increased by 2.1% and 9.3% respectively in the quarter. On a September year-to-date basis, our organic cigarette volume declined by 0.6% or by approximately 1.1% excluding estimated inventory movement. For 2015, we continue to forecast an organic cigarette volume decline in the range of 1% to 1.5%.","Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the quarter grew by 5.9% and 9.3% respectively excluding currency. This growth was driven by strong pricing across all the regions partly offset by the impact of lower volume mainly in the Asia region. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency grew by 15.8% to $1.61. Our strong currency neutral result in the third quarter has derived September year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15.8% to $4.62 on the same basis. ","As previously disclosed our fourth quarter results will be impacted by incremental investments to support the expansion of iQOS including accelerated spending behind planned launches in 2015 and 2016 and to further reinforce the favorable momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio.","As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are revising a narrowing our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.35 to $4.40 at prevailing exchange rate to reflect a slightly more unfavorable currency impact largely offset by an improved business outlook driven mainly by the EU and EEMA regions. At prevailing exchange rate, our guidance now includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.22 per share versus $1.15 in our previous guidance. Excluding currency, our 2015 guidance represents a growth rate of 11% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. This growth rate is above 9% to 11% range that we provided in July.","The evolution of the impact of exchange rates in our 2015 report the diluted EPS guidance is presented on this slide. While exchange rates have been volatile throughout the year the negative impact on our guidance has been relatively stable with the slight increase in our latest guidance that have been mainly by weakening of the Russian Ruble versus the U.S. dollar.","Strong pricing remains the key driver of our financial performance. In the third quarter we recorded a variance of $522 million reflecting higher pricing across all four regions. We increase the retail prices during the quarter in key markets such as Argentina, Indonesia and Russia. September year-to-date pricing variance of $1.6 billion puts on track to achieve full year pricing above our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion.","Our results in the third quarter were underpinned by continuous market share gains. International market share excluding China and the U.S. increase by 0.3 points to 29.2% with strong growth in EEMA and Latin America and Canada region. Marlboro was a key driver of this market share growth increasing by 0.4 points to 9.9%. The grand grew share in all of our regions as it continuous to ban it from rollout of architecture 2.0 which is now available in 84 markets largely. Importantly our share in the top 30 PMI is OCI markets grew by 0.5 points to 37.8% with share up or essentially flat in 18 of this market.","I'll now provide an update on selected geographies beginning with the EU region. Excluding trade inventory movements estimated cigarette industry volume decline by 0.1% in the third quarter following declines of 2.7% and 2.3 in the first and second quarters respectively. We actually did the strong third quarter performance mainly to improving economic conditions and consumer sentiment and I'll forecast a full year 2015 decline of around 2%.","Our cigarette markets in the EU region decline slightly in the third quarter due mainly to Italy. September year-to-date our cigarettes share increased by 0.1 point to 39.9%. Cigarette share in the quarter was supported by the growth of our two largest brands in the region. Share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 19.3% driven by strong performances in France and Spain. While share of L&M increased by 0.1 point to 7.1%. The combination of our strong pricing the more favorable cigarette industry volume trend and our stable overall cigarette market share resulted in third quarter and September year-to-date adjusted OCI growth of 7.4% and 8.1% respectively excluding currency and acquisitions.","Turning now to Russia in our EEMA region estimated cigarette industry volumes declined by 4.6% in the third quarter. Giving the resilience of the September year-to-date cigarette industry volume trends we are revising our full year 2015 forecast to a decline of around 7%. Our market share performance in Russia remained strong. Our good quarter-to-date show increase by 1.3 points to 28.7% driven by low price bond street and super low max. Both brands continued to benefit from wider distribution particularly in the Eastern part of the country. ","Higher pricing drove double-digit OCI growth excluding currency in the third quarter. In our gross, we announced the further retail selling price increase of 5 rubles per pack across the majority of our portfolio which will be increasingly reflected at retail as the fourth quarter progresses.","Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 11.8% in the third quarter fueling September year-to-date growth of 9.6%. We attribute the strong growth to a significant reduction in real estate trade which is estimated to be at its lowest level in the past six years.","Our August quarter-to-date market share increased by one point to 44.1%. This marked the first year-over-year quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2013 and was driven by L&M, Marlboro and Parliament. Favorable volume mix and pricing drove double-digit OCI growth excluding currency in the third quarter.","Moving to Asia region while our market show Indonesia was flat in the third quarter it increased by 0.4 points to 35.2% September year-to-date. We are pleased by the strength of Sampoerna which has continued its growth trend despite its main volume having crossed the critical CHF15,000 per pack price point. Dji Sam Soe also continues to gain share, thanks mainly to its machine made magnum volumes. ","Estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 1.1% in September year-to-date period. We attribute the decline primarily through a softening in the economic environment and now we expect flat full year cigarette industry volume in 2015. However we continue to expect an increase of 1% to 3% annually over the mid to long-term driven by growth in the adult population and rising income levels. ","Last week, Sampoerna announced the approval by shareholders of its plan for a rights issue at an exercise price of CHF77,000 per share. The transactions will be one of the largest stock offerings in the past year across the whole of Southeast Asia and showcases the strength of our business in Indonesia. The total net proceeds for Sampoerna from the right issue will amount to approximately $1.4 billion after completion of the transaction 7.5% of Sampoerna issued and outstanding shares will be publicly owned in compliance of the Indonesia stock exchanges minimum public shareholding requirement that takes effect from January 30, 2016. Clearly this injection of cash will enhance our financial flexibility and we will determine how best to use it in the long-term interest of our shareholders while keeping a very watchful eye on currency movement.","In the near-term the proceeds will be used by Sampoerna for working capital purposes. As you know beginning in 2015 excise payment terms in Indonesia has been shortened for the last two months of the year which will obviously put pressure on our year end working capital. ","In Japan estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 1.5% in the third quarter resulting in a decrease of 2.2% for the September year-to-date period. For 2015 we continue to forecast the full year decline in the range of 2.5% to 3%.","Our share in the quarter was down by 0.6 points to 25.3% due mainly to the strength and timing of competitors offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. We are committed to improving our share in this important market and are further investing behind our pipeline of innovations.","The underlying business fundamentals in the Philippines continue to improve though show trends based on the total tax based cigarette market remained distorted due to higher estimated tax declarations by our principal local competitors. ","Based on Nielsen retail audit data, which we believe provide additional insight into our performance in the current environment our August quarter-to-date market share increased by 1.4 points to 73.7% driven by Marlboro and our leading low price brand fortune. This positive share performance was driven by two main factors first reduced gaps since the beginning of the year following price increases for super low price brands at the bottom of the market have led to adult smoker upgrading to Marlboro across all three pillars and fortune. ","And second, we have strengthened our portfolio for a range of investments in brand initiatives including new launches and innovative line extension.","This is evidenced by the strong performance of Marlboro\u2019s capsule and highly mentholated variant as well as the success of our fortune capsule variant which we launched in July this year. Favorable volume mix driven by a 17.8% increase in Marlboro\u2019s shipment volume resulted in improved profitability in the third quarter.","The excise tax driven cigarette industry volume decline in Korea continues to moderate sequentially resulting in a decline of approximately 17% September year-to-date excluding estimated inventory movements. And we now expect a similar decline for the full year. Our market share in Korea increased by 1.8 points in the third quarter to 20.4% driven by the strong performance of Marlboro.","Shifting to our Reduced-Risk products portfolio, I will now provide a brief update on our commercializations and clinical assessment of iQOS. During the third quarter there were number of important commercial developments. We launched iQOS in Switzerland in August with an initial focus on five major cities and began the national expansion of iQOS in Japan in September. We also progressed with our expansion plan for Italy which includes additional city launches commencing later this quarter as well planned city launches in other markets in late 2015 and early 2016. For which we have accelerated investment spending this year. ","Let me remind you that today, iQOS has been launched with the convenience claims of no ash and less smell. As we build our scientific evidence package which I will touch and now we expect to be able to broaden our claims. ","Clinical trials are a cornerstone of our robust evidence package to substantiate reduced exposure and a reduced risk claims. We are conducting four types of clinical studies, pharmacokinetics studies, one week reduced exposure studies in the clinic, three month reduced exposure ambulatory studies, and the long-term exposure response studies. We have completed all of this except for the long-term studies.","I will now share with you a selection of the results from our three months reduced exposure study in Japan. In the study we measured biomarkers of exposure to harmful and potentially harmful compounds refers to as HVACs in adult smokers were switched iQOS adult smokers who treat for the duration of the study and adult smokers who continues to smoke combustible cigarettes. ","The biomarkers were measured in each group over five days in the clinics and then for 85 days outside the clinic. Allowing guys to assess changes in biomarkers of exposure in a closed to real work setting. We then confer the reductions in exposure biomarkers of the group that switch to iQOS with the group that quit. This slide shows the Japan's started results for four key biomarker of exposure. The data show that compared to adult smokers who continues smoking shown in red, the reductions in exposure biomarkers for adult smokers who switched to iQOS shown in blue approach those for the adult smokers who quit for the duration of the study which is shown in green. ","In the study, we measured a total of 15 biomarkers of exposures to 15 HVACs. As illustrated by the chart, the average reductions in biomarkers of exposure for adult smokers who switched to iQOS shown in blue reached over 95% of the reduction of serving dose who assist smoking during the starting period shown in green. We expect to finalize the study reports by year end and it will fix to publish the data in the peer review of Scientific Journals in 2016. Recognizing how important it will that iQOS is accepted by adult smokers in the same three month study in Japan we measured the level of product satisfaction of participants who switched to iQOS. ","As shown here, after an initial decline in product satisfaction the score rapidly increase and reached levels similar to dose for combustible cigarette.","In summary, our scientific assessment of the risk profile of iQOS is well advanced and we are on course with our plan to demonstrate that iQOS is not only a reduced exposure product but also a reduced risk product.","Turning now to our free cash flow, we generated $4.5 billion in the first nine months of the year. This is only moderately below our free cash flow for the same period in 2014 despite an adverse currency impact of $1.8 billion. Or resilient cash flow performance was supported by the prudent management of working capital and capital expenditures. In 2015, we continue to forecast free cash flow broadly in line with the last year level despite the significant currency headwinds.","In September, our board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4.08 per share reflecting a strong confidence in our business fundamentals and the future prospects. These marks the eight consecutive dividend increase since the spin-off in the March 2008 representing a total increase of approximately 122% or compound annual growth of 12%. As of last Friday's market close our dividend yield of 4.9% was significantly above that of our proxy peer group, our tobacco peer companies and 10 year U.S. treasury notes.","In conclusion, we deliver strong currency neutral result in the third quarter reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and the robust business fundamental. Our superior brand portfolio supported by superb commercial organization is driving strong pricing and the further market share gain. We continue to book to progress with the commercialization and clinical assessment of iQOS. Our resilience 2015 free cash flow has been supported by our prudent management of working capital and capital expenditures.","Finally, on a currency neutral basis our 2015 EPS guidance reflect the growth rate of 11% to 12% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02. This impressive growth comes notwithstanding the significant incremental investments that we are making in the fourth quarter to support the expansion of iQOS and to range first the favorable momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio.","Thank you and I will be now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","As we look to the fourth quarter considering the very strong year-to-date results that we've seen the implied guidance for the fourth quarter clearly reflecting the incremental investment spending effect that you just called out. Can you help dimensional the size of those investment if possible as well? Can you address any trade inventory timing issues that might way on the fourth quarter?","Jacek Olczak","I think that most of the performance in that Q4 the fourth quarter will be driven by our accelerated and being pre-investments behind iQOS and combustible cigarettes. I think as we look at this today differential it should translate that will be slightly below the fourth quarter of last year maybe at par the fourth quarter of last year. So yes there will be a quite investments step up as I said mainly behind the iQOS and the combustible business.","Vivien Azer","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And as we look at the EU and the increasingly more favorable volume dynamics that we seeing, I know you guys called out production in illicit as well as reduced uptake and -- but can you comment on the evolution of price elasticities in that market because the volume trajectory looks particularly impressive giving the pricing that we are seeing in the region?","Jacek Olczak","The volumes trajectory is impressive and there is also the reason and also there isn't why as you remember we're revising the outlook for the total industry volume in the year. I think it is the second or third time actually I think this year and it has also led us to increase our overall EPS guidance for this year. Our elasticity is now turning over some period into their more attractive territory why could call it like this, that's for us always elasticity in the range of -0.3 to -0.5, this is what we think is the source of the underlying elasticity for the tobacco category and we observe essentially in the most of the countries including the Southern Europe. Hence the very strong performance coming from Spain, Italy. Obviously Italy will have their own challenges with Marlboro closing 5 Euro price point. ","But overall I think the industry is pretty strong and our volumes obviously are pretty strong as well. I think that many of this positives for the Europe adult from the overall better volume trends to some extend depends on a geography supported by a more attractive elasticity all the reduction in illicit trade should continue to the 2016 so the way we look at this and I know that everyone is now puzzled with Q4 performance but we actually our focus is already on 2016 and how much of these are very positive momentum for the industry but very much for us will continue into the 2016.","Vivien Azer","Perfect. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew Grainger","Thanks. Yeah just first on Indonesia we\u2019ve seen continued deceleration in shipments in consumption this year which seems more linked to the economic environment than pricing but it\u2019s hard to separate out how all of these factors maybe impacting margins and OCI for the Asia region so when you take into account all these various factors pricing, weaker consumption some of the investments you\u2019ve made in selling infrastructure are you comfortable with how the profitability and margins of the Indonesian business have been progressing year-to-date?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, I am very comfortable I mean what we have seen in Indonesia was more in the I think event of the third quarter where we\u2019ve been also adjusting capacity and it resulted in some extra cost which we had to incur but overall I am not that much worry of the shorter trend of the industry volume if you look at the smoking incidents in Indonesia it\u2019s relatively flat as you remember Indonesia is the market when you have a relatively high incidence of stick sales individual stick sales and obviously this allows the consumers to adjust a little bit faster if there is softening on the macro side. ","I think so we observing a slight decline in a daily consumption but as I said in my remarks I think if you look at the overall positive demographics of Indonesia and growing the income level et cetera I am still confident 1% to 3% growth outlook for the total industry in the longer term is absolutely attainable pricing is very strong we still obviously don\u2019t know how the tax discussions in Indonesia will unfold for the next year. I think on a positive note is that since the government is recognizing that there was the issue which they inflated tax base due to the change in a payment terms for this year so conferring on a collection side from a government perspective 14 months to 12 months. ","Let\u2019s remain hopeful that the rate announced for the next year will take this into consideration at least to some extent we\u2019ll have to see. But in terms of a bottom-line growth of Indonesia I am very confident we\u2019ll have infrastructure brand portfolio is very strong, share for the year looks, market share development looks very attractive and I think Indonesia is the market in which we obviously have the high expectations of a high growth. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything which would worry me at this stage why this should change.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. And then just one clarification just in terms of the bottom-line growth for Indonesia and long-term expectations there, is that consistent with how the businesses performing this year are you seeing growth or is this better characterized as the year where you are reinvesting a bit back into the market?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean we have been investing in Indonesia last and this year is behind deployment of a commercial organization as you know it\u2019s a large country there is a very large sales force retail selling universe is one of the largest in the world. So that obviously requires some appropriate investments if we want to continue to have the right support behind the brands. We have the market in other parts of the world which also on an emerging side if you like and volumes are actually a little bit developing versus I may say versus Indonesia and we can drive the double-digit bottom-line growth. So I think you cannot ever extrapolate directly for one country to another but I think Indonesia is in a good shape to deliver a very solid OCI growth bottom-line growth and remains one of the key contributors to Asia and PNR [ph].","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks Jacek. And then just one question on the regulatory side, just wanted to get your thoughts on the draft version of the PPP agreement which I know right now is sort of under negotiation and on hold. But assuming this is going to be negotiated and will go forward. What do you see is the practical impact of the tobacco carve out if it stays in and is there still a realistic potential for it to be negotiated out.","Jacek Olczak","Well as far as the PPP has no impact on a pending paces right. So it's mainly Australia, UK. But we'll have to see how PPP will be adopted by the rectified by the signature is. And if I may say on my side just say there is unfortunately there is negotiation during the negotiations people who are participating can traded away furnace and access to adjust this for all investors and instead they embrace the discrimination against the one single industry. I'm not sure that people have worried a doubt of the five or six countries actually more than a six countries reported cases when there was a state investors dispute on the -- related to tobaccos. So I think the whole process went in a completely wrong direction. What important for us is that it hasn't deteriorate our position is that we defending very much the trademarks around the plain packaging and does not impact any of our pending cases and we sure that PPP adopt.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thanks guys.","Jacek Olczak","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning.","Nick Rolli","Good morning Judy.","Judy Hong","So just and thinking about 2016, I know it's a little bit too early but you talked about how you focused on continuing to growth in 2016. So as we look at this year obviously 11% to 12% expects currency growth above your kind a near to medium-term target that you lead out at your Investor Day in 2014. So given the momentum you have in EU, you're lapping the incremental spending behind the iQOS. Just any reason to think that that kind of above average or above near to medium-term growth in 2016 can continue at this point?","Jacek Olczak","Look Judy the outlook for the tobacco market has improved has improved this year. For us in particular in terms of the volume ex-pricing and overall profit growth. So I mean a many of the project its which will have offset this year which will have businesses this year in our opinion should continue in the 2016. I think it's a pretty much sure at this stage to talk about the specific guidance for 2016. Our target of 8% to 10% on EPS I think seems obtainable. But we need the more information to come up with the formal guidance for next year. I think in February we will be in a good positions to talk about. ","But yes that the trends from the Europe to Russia all the way still repeated Russia remains in our worse place. The headline macros are not extremely positive although of the tobacco market size and the cigarette market side I mean that seems that consumer so far are navigating the pretty strongly. You will have to also understand that this year we're very pleased we're very happy with the performance of this year but not necessarily we've had the most challenging performance like the year before. ","Correspondingly we'll have to see how the 2016 will compared to 2015. So I mean I remains very optimistic we've been I have to admit surprise ourselves by this strong performance of the EU region. I am very glad that it comes from the number of markets being total markets but also strong pricing and the markets trend. EEMA is very strong, Latin America is very strong. Asia we know that we have a couple of issues, mainly in Japan which I have to admit is a disappointing and below our expectations with regards to market share. But overall we look very optimistically into the 2016.","Judy Hong","Okay. And then just one quick follow-up on FX. So I think I have it in my notes, I think earlier in the year you hedged about I can't remember the 60% on the Yens and the effective hedge rate was one-tenth or around that level. So can you just update on how you are hedged at this point and what the effective rate is?","Jacek Olczak","We don't talk that way at the beginning of the year we only give the hedge coverage ratio for the current year. So in February we are giving currency the guidance, we said that we will hedge up to 60%, obviously there were few moments during a year when the Yen strengthen at least for the short period of time. So we took advantage of that. If you remember our policies to look at have 12 to 18 months. So we prefer to assume that we have already have hedged some of our cash flow from Japan going in 2016. ","We've already disclosed this number when we will give the guidance in February next year. When it comes to effective rate just to help a little bit to estimate the currency impact in Q3 within our effective Yen, effective rate of Yen to the Dollar for us was 111 slightly above 111 which comprise to about 98 Yen in Q3 of past year. So you could see for the hedging strategy we had about 9-10 Yen below the current spot rates of Yen.","Judy Hong","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from James Bushnell of Exane.","James Bushnell","Hi, good morning or good afternoon in Switzerland.","Jacek Olczak","Good afternoon, good morning.","James Bushnell","Thank you. I have two questions please. The first one is just around pricing in Europe. You have pricing around 5% which is a little bit softer than the first two quarters of the year. I just wonder if those anything specific you call out there or if that strictly a mathematical effects and then my second -- sorry, I'll let you answer the first question.","Jacek Olczak","No, this is mainly I guess the due to the timing of implementation. You might have never will have the perfect type of timing alignment. So some of the pricing which were taking in 2014 to some of the -- in 2015 depends on the counterfeit. It's nothing specific, nothing which is -- I think the pricing in the Europe is here so far and this full year is going to be very strong and a much stronger than we had in the past year.","James Bushnell","Okay, thank you and then just to drill in a bit more on Italy. You obviously have good pricing this year. I wondered if you could comment on what the outlook might be for the tax policy in 2016 and now that Marlboro is really above that ramp upfront which is hurt you on the share basis? Are you comfortable that moving it out further will not have similar effect? How are you thinking about the share loss of Marlboro in Italy?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean it's not anything which comes by surprise. I mean them usually when we cross their importance from psychological perspective one price point. Marlboro usually is a first brand in the market to do this. It's not really as I said surprised that the Marlboro has a bit of a headwind at that time. I think we -- I'm happy that the prices went up in Italy. There was a small reduction in the price -- I mean that's very helpful. You cross that price points and later on consumer is to be less sensitive with the next price increases. I think it's good that Marlboro is behind the price point. Let's put it that way.","James Bushnell","And is there any due from the Italian government in terms of what might happen to taxes next year?","Jacek Olczak","No, we'll have to see. I mean usually these discussions are taking place literally almost around the year end or beginning of the year. So for Italy we'll have to see how they want to approach. If they make the very good move as you remember at the beginning of this year. Let's hope that they will continue with this direction in 2016.","James Bushnell","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning Chris.","Chris Growe","Good afternoon to you. Thank you. Two question for you if I could, the first would be that if your volume performance again this quarter was better than what I expected and you had some improvements in the EU and Russia in particular, little software in Indonesia in terms of your outlook there. So as you look at the overall line performance being stronger than certainly I thought for the quarter and we're just talking for like 1 to 1.5% decline in volume for the year we just push more towards the lower end of that range or just wanted to get some color around some of the big markets that are improving how that\u2019s helping your overall volume performance.","Jacek Olczak","Look, I would still confirm it will be somewhere in the range of a 1% to 1.5% I don\u2019t think we are in a position now to speculate we\u2019ll be closer to 1%. As you know Q4 is always there a quarter when you have some distortions coming from a fact that end of the year or beginning of the year the tax increases, price changes et cetera. So I think for a cost of doubt for 1% to 1.5% is pretty realistic, EU has a good volume it\u2019s no question about it, Russia we are rolling out the 5 rubles per pack price increase so some of this prices already will roll through the market we\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going impact the overall industry and our shipments volume that from the we have a sequential good performance in Korea, Philippines there is a good performance overall see how we close but it looks good and as I said before I think some of the positive industry trends and this is not just the quarter-on-quarter but longer term I think they should continue to happen in the 2016.","Chris Growe","Okay. Just one other question probably which is around the Asia division overall and we talk last quarter on the call about the Asia division approaching in your mid-term guidance sort of range for profitability this quarter and I think year-to-date you are up around 4% I guess so relate to that should we expect a stronger fourth quarter in that Asia region and then related to that should we see any inventory adjustments occurring in Japan in this fourth quarter it\u2019s been kind of an up and down pattern for those this year.","Jacek Olczak","No we are taking the inventory adjustment are related to the lower than expected market share so obviously we don\u2019t want to \u2013 high inventories and try to have something which reflects the at least short-term forecast. So depends how we perform in Q4 I mean there might be some inventory movement we are also comparing Q4 to the distorted Q4 last year when we are going to shutting down the factory in Holland in Europe, which ship most of the product to Japan used to be shipped from this factory. ","So we are building some inventory to be on a safer side. If you go to the overall performance of the Asia region Asia is a recipient of increased investment this year behind iQOS and also behind the combustible cigarette because we are investing obviously Japan is in a full fledge rollout to about 60% of the total market we started in September we have not deployed all tools behind iQOS in the market we will be gearing up to opening more iQOS flagship stores is obviously is going to have a cost impact there was an increased investment behind the cigarette category in Philippines behind the very strong momentum and the narrowing of the price gaps continue investment in Indonesia. ","So Asia will not have a spectacular performance this year better than the last year but we will not have a spectacular performance this year.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","I have a question on iQOS in Italy and the draft tobacco products directive are you broadly happy with the directive and as it written such that you will be able to ultimately make reduce risk claims on iQOS? And then could you update us on any new product and or technology innovation behind iQOS and when you might be ready to roll something out?","Jacek Olczak","I think we are pleased with the development of the tobacco product directive so far is being transport into the Italian legislation I think critical for us is and therefore we announced publicly today the results of our 90 days or three months exposure study because that\u2019s one of the key elements of us discussing with regulatory bodies on the claims and we\u2019re going to maybe about the products so that will be positive. We're now at this stage when we fine tuning of finalizing the claims as seems them we have customers so we will not have as well achieve the proper understanding. As I think we have a pretty solid evidence at this stage to progress and support iQOS rollouts with the reduced at least exposure claims at this stage. ","In terms of the new innovations, yes there is a pipeline of a new developments behind iQOS for obvious reasons Bonnie I can't tell you at this stage, but yes I mean I believe that pretty strong innovations that which will come into the market for this year and that to the new market as the large group of the new markets next year when they will see the further enhanced the improved versions of iQOS in terms of HeatSticks. And the variety of the blend type directions which we can offer as well as iQOS is the device in terms of attached field more user friendly electronics and so on. So as you remember [indiscernible] was launched in the pretty industrial I would say high performance iQOS device. But you are all in these the new version much more modern and a much more I believe actually to smokers to adult smokers. And I think we'll be deploying more of these innovations as we speak.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay thanks. And then I just have sort of big picture question as you think about your business overall, can you identify for us markets for you're seeing the biggest improvements and down trending pressures easing or moderating just in summary?","Jacek Olczak","Well I think EU overall is the holds very well actually improved very well. To the extent that the mix essentially issue for us does not exists in the EU market. But that's very good. You have in EEMA region you will have the strong performance we've up trading in the big part of the North Africa. Turkey holds very well I mean despite the fact that total industry volumes up and obviously some of this early stage recoveries usually initially fuel the bottom part of the market, but if I look at the parliament and the Marlboro share performance despite the strong market. I mean it's pretty -- it's very solid. You have obviously big up trading in Philippines right as a result above a closure of --. And well it's very important to us is that it's not the one product variance of Marlboro which takes the benefit of the up trading is across all variance of Marlboro we see the up trading. So that's important, but as we said we'll have to see how the pricing further unfolds in Philippines, but so far year it is that clears as we initially planned despite the fact that as you remember we had a couple of difficult years in Philippines but the recoveries is on a good track.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the Bill Marshall of Barclays.","Bill Marshall","Hi. Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning Bill.","Bill Marshall","Just kind of building off with that question actually. I want to talk about trade because it feels like you mentioned a quite a bit in the press release today mostly on the positive side particularly in the EU and EEMA. A little bit more negative it sounded like in Asia with some increases in listed trade. Has this become more of a cyclical factor for you guys and kind of again going back to last question indicative of up trading and down trading? Or is it something that some governments are starting to take an even harder line and you're seeing some improvement there.","Jacek Olczak","No just to clarify I think the only market which we have a well sharp growing at least way at this stage is Australia. Okay, it would be something in Pakistan but the adjust [ph] is a little long. You have generally we can observe a better illicit or lower illicit trade levels in EU in the number of markets not just the one particular. And that's the product that's I think this is strongly supporting the total industry recovery or better trends. We have Philippines alone with the higher declarations coming from a mighty I mean that's clearly the recovery of that tax not paid volumes and Turkey has the extremely strong recovery. I think usually I think as its highest level if I recall Turkey was about 20% of the listed trade penetration and I think recently shrink to about 11%. So that's really lowest over the long period of time incidence of the listed trade in Turkey. If you pay net-net that's about 10 points of a straight recovery and you see year-to-date market in Turkey about 10%, there was underlying growth, secular growth in Turkey. But still 10% only can be explained by the recovery of the listed trade. So we see it in the number of geographies.","Now we have invested also a lot of efforts manpower effort behind engaging with the government, engaging with the key stakeholders being the custom law enforcement etcetera international organization. I think it's finally I'm going to start bringing a very good fruit and that's thing that many of this positive development of the listed trade. So my opinion continues at least in the near future.","Bill Marshall","Okay, great. Thank you and then just a point of clarification when we talk about this spending particularly behind iQOS, did you push any of that spending from the third quarter into the fourth quarter? And if so could you quantify any of that spending for us and what this could mean as we look forward to that push into 2016 at all or is this kind of your on track for the plan how do you saw it earlier in the year? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","I think we have a more of the push from a 2016 and in 2015 as we revised our plans and we rolled-out iQOS to the more geographies that we have initially planned at the beginning of the year. You might have some distortion, the timing in fact between Q3 and Q4 because once we accelerated our plans for deployment I mean as far as you need to have a plans developed on a solid when you come spending. So usually spending follows a little bit after the plans are discussed approved and released to the market ready to go. ","But I think it's the more of the 2016 going to 2015 in terms of iQOS over an acceleration than just the Q3 to Q4 and if I remember we have been indicating that on the back half of the year we will have that we expect the higher spending on iQOS and throughout the list that as we observe during the first three quarters of the year much stronger momentum behind the cigarette business which have also step up some investment behind that cargo of our portfolio.","Bill Marshall","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery","Good morning, good afternoon.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Michael Lavery","I just wanted to follow up on Vivien's question first and clarify make sure I call what you said, you said that it might you are talking about 4Q, you are talking about parity to last year\u2019s 4Q or maybe slightly below, was that on EPS basis?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, this was on EPS basis. Thanks for helping to clarify. I said this would be can't be slightly below last year maybe as parity. But this is on EPS currency to be to formally drive.","Michael Lavery","Also then if you've guessed, if my math is right you've got $3.61 for the 9 months-to-date this year. It looks like that would mean a 74 to 79 in fourth quarter for your full year guidance. But I reconcile it with slightly below last year? It felt like that's quite a bit below even with currency included.","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean I think you mark these both right. I think the guidance it depends on which point of a new guidance you are going to base the calculation to take out what we had in the Q4 and that's the -- about the results.","Michael Lavery","Okay and then just what maybe to dig into that a little bit more and get some color on as a spending you've got year-to-date and average quarterly organic growth rate of around 6.5% and organic EBIT growth around the 11% average, last year\u2019s 4Q organic EBIT growth was down 12. So it's your easiest comparison and you have a lot of momentum this year. How much could you possibly spend in that? I mean it looks like you might need $300 million to $400 million of incremental investments to get to the kind a numbers you're talking about. Do you even have the abilities to spend that much in an effective way in one quarter?","Jacek Olczak","We have a very large organization. I think twice the sizeable brand iQOS itself. I think 400 is on a high side but I think it will be an obviously substantially do the comps. When you do the comps you have to just notice the one thing that growth on those CI level last year versus lowering the EPS level I mean it's slightly different. We have the few items that's below their CI level. But it will still stay with my maps in on an EPS in the Q1 and on an ex-currency basis we put the below what have last year.","Michael Lavery","Okay now that's very helpful. Thanks. And then just touching back on Indonesia, you're saying that you think the category volumes probably are going to be about flat this year. But with the last two quarters down over 4%. It looks like that would be, meaning about a 3% gain in 4Q or about 7 point improvement. Obviously there is some macro pressure there that's helping the inflation side because inflation is moderating. But is there any particular catalyst for why the category might accelerate that rapidly for 4Q or maybe we're missing.","Jacek Olczak","Well this is a cigarette industry estimate on the quarterly basis. And I said that in one of the previous calls I wouldn't pay that much attention how the estimate is being done and what the numbers are on the quarterly basis. I think for the full year I think it seems that Indonesia based on our outlook Indonesia will turn to be a flattish or flat versus last year. You might have some movement between the quarters. It's marginally the consumption level of the industry shipments volumes so will have to both into the timing of the price changes in the market and what's happened last quarter versus during the fourth quarter of last year. And what expect at this -- expect it will happen in a fourth quarter of this year. ","I think for this year yes I mean you have the softer end of volumes in Indonesia I mean that's slightly a lower sort of a performance. But as I said in my remarks, it hasn't nothing really comes in Indonesia which will trouble us in our view then in the longer term the market is potential to grow with the 1% to 2% range. It's critical for us is to know whether the tax rate for the next year and then we done have the better estimate have Indonesia market will perform good. We think is that the pricing is very strong I think a lot of investments which we have made behind the commercial organization as well as the capacity restructuring between handmade and hand -- all than the machine by cigarette is done. There is solid performance next year.","Michael Lavery","Okay now that's helpful. And then just on Australia you've mentioned the strong pricing there and the gains in bond street and some other positives. Just on a total view that certainly was a big issue last year it seems like it's at the minimum now getting the same attention because it's improved a good bit. Can you just put that total your total business there in context and how you see the maybe next rest of the year or beyond in terms of outlook for that?","Jacek Olczak","Well I don't think we've -- with Australia yet okay. This year Australia by far less of a drop for our Asia and the total PMI performance that was last year. But we cannot say -- here that this kind of segments are moderated to muted its growth compared to how fast the segment was growing essentially all quarters of last year. We are much more presenting the segment with bond street I mean enhance the significant share advancement. We still observe quite a level of a discounting in the market. ","So I mean now the market the total market size is a bit distorted because the just after the tax change tax exchange. We'll have to see I think we've did and before coming tax changes we should hopefully see moderation of the heavy discounting that very much at the bottom of the market and we\u2019ll have to see the trends are slightly better but it\u2019s I wouldn\u2019t call that Australia is behind.","Michael Lavery","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Phil Quorum [ph] of Morningstar.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the call. Jacek you are building a compelling case behind iQOS my question is how would you characterize your confidence at this that \u2013 that will be the category that emerges with the highest acceptance rate among consumers? And then what\u2019s the implication of that on other categories, would it still make sense to spend behind platforms three and four for example? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","I maybe start with the second part of your question I think it makes sense to continue our investment in terms of a product development and its assessment scientific assessment behind the other platforms because we think that there is a market for both fully electronic cigarette as well as the products which are based on a \u2013 heat not burg, heat not burn today offers consumers what we observe in the market a level of a satisfaction which is very comparable to the combustible cigarette. ","Knowing that the evidence which we have presented also today makes us confident that this is a product which significantly reduces the risk profile of the consumers versus continuing smoking combustible cigarette I think we will be in a position to demonstrate based again on our studies and the whole portfolio of evidence that the product is reducing significantly the risk for smoking versus the traditional combustible product. ","Acceptance is a very important component also in a few of our strategy of not only demonstrating that we can reduce the harm to individual but we can reduce the harm to population, because you might have a great product which is accepted which is of a reduce which has a reduced risk profile but is not accepted by consumers and frankly speaking you not address the problem the issue.","So yes we remain very confident that the current product which we have iQOS has a big potential but we also think that consumers not all consumers will like to stay within tobacco based products and they may for variety of reasons they may elect to go into the straight non-tobacco based but nicotine based electronic cigarette as with \u2013 initial high interest in many markets including UK and some others in the Europe or the U.S. so yes we will continue investing behind all four platforms as we believe there is a room and a potential for each of these platforms going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Hello. Thank you for taking my question. On the reduced risk products can you tell me who will give you permission to make the claims either reduced exposure or reduced risk claims is that national versus in every country would it require EU central permission from Brazil for EU countries? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Well in the case of the United States that\u2019s clearly FDA in the case of the EU the way that European tobacco product directive is being transferred it is being delegated to the individual member state. So we will have to have well the first we\u2019ll have to determine what sort of a process individual member states wants to have in the territory to allow for the claims et cetera. But it\u2019s very, very specific or very different country by country and market by market there are some markets today where we can go and make claims already as we say today.","Adam Spielman","And just follow-up. Within the markets that you also currently we\u2019re currently talking about which I guess is the European markets particularly Italy, Switzerland which is obviously non-EU, Japan wherever countries where you have the best dialog and you think you got the best chance of making a health claimer or reduced risk reduced exposure claim.","Jacek Olczak","I think you know the countries we have a good engagement. The critical is that we need to support the discussions the engagement with the [indiscernible]. And therefore it was very critical for us that we progressing as per plan in the conducting this started as we announced today. The 90 days starter which was important I know beyond the one piece of EBITDA which you are bringing to the table. Obviously the more evidence you have at the table the more constructive discussions you have. As I think we\u2019re on a good path in each of this country despite the fact that they have some differences in the regular projects.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Russo from Russo Guard [ph].","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Congratulations on wonderful numbers keep up the good work. I was curious I may have missed the comments on that Transpacific partners backed up forward revising legislations. And wondered what comments you may have made or what you might make on that.","Jacek Olczak","So thank you very much for congratulations. On the PPP I've made two comments one is that PPP is no impact on a pending phases which you have. So it's been most importantly the case which we have in Australia will not be impacted by the PPP. Going forward, we'll have to see solid PPP is going to be primarily adopted by the individual signatures of the street. ","As I hear I mean in the US in particular although we're seeing some other places is not necessary that it receives enormous reception. For obvious reasons which I mentioned because the net of \u2013 have things allows one in Australia and if you look at the statistics of all the investors states disputes so far, it will bit more going to be see this comes with dispute between the investors and the days and on the two of the business relates to tobacco. ","So difficult to find the logic while industry is convert. It was all about the later of what we called treatment it will access adjusted and some negotiators have violated or forgot about that principle. It's a sad story but as I said at this stage I don't think it impact on our abilities to defend our positions with regards to protecting our trade more.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Thank you. And so did you will challenged because its present issue and arbitrary and we don't think it happen might this year is that cause of action regarding Australia.","Jacek Olczak","That's correct.","Q \u2013 Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes the question-and-answer session in today's conference.

Jacek?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are raising our 2016 reported diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to a range of $4.45 to $4.55 at prevailing exchange rates. The revision is driven solely by currency. Our full year business outlook remains strong. Our guidance therefore now includes $0.40 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.","We expect our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth in the third quarter to be broadly in line with that of the second quarter. Consequently, our full year 2016 adjusted diluted EPS growth on the same basis is expected to be heavily skewed toward the final quarter, largely reflecting a favorable comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2015, during which we made significant investments behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio. As seen on this slide, the $0.05 moderation in the currency impact on our guidance primarily reflects the appreciation of the Japanese yen and the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar since we last provided guidance in April.","Let me now take you through our second quarter results. Our organic cigarette shipment volume declined by 4.8% or by 4.3% excluding estimated inventory movement due in large part to decreases in low margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines. These markets accounted for approximately two points of the organic cigarette shipment volume decline. Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter increased by 1.4% and 1.8% respectively excluding currency. The growth in adjusted OCI reflected favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume mix, particularly in the EEMA and Asia regions, as well as higher costs related to the commercialization of iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 1.7% excluding currency.","Our favorable pricing variance of $344 million in the second quarter reflected positive contributions from all regions, notably EU and EEMA. The favorable pricing in the Asia region was driven by Indonesia and the Philippines, partly offset by Japan and Korea.","During the quarter, we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets, including those shown on this slide, which should support favorable pricing in the second half of the year. In addition, earlier this month we received approval from the Minister of Finance in Japan to increase the retail price of select Parliament variants by \u00a510 per pack effective August 1.","For the full year, we continue to anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenue. Our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.4 points in the quarter due mainly to the Asia region. Marlboro cigarette share increased slightly with growth in the EU, Asia and Latin American and Canada regions, partly offset by a decline in the EEMA region.","Turning now to our regional results. Cigarette industry volume in the EU region declined by a modest 0.3%, excluding estimated inventory movements, reflecting a continuation of the four favorable trends listed on the slide that we have observed over recent quarters. We also attribute some of the industry resilience to the estimated favorable impact of immigration in select geographies.","The continued moderation in the level of illicit trade is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It concluded that the incidence of illicit trade in the EU declined by 0.6 points to 9.8% in 2015 with decreases in most major markets. For the full year, we forecast a decline in cigarette industry volume of around 1%.","Our cigarette market share in the EU region decreased by 0.2 points in the second quarter. The decline was due mainly to Germany and Italy, partly offset by share growth in four of the region's other largest markets by industry volume where Marlboro's share increased.","In Germany, the share decline was due in large part to estimated inventory movements, though it also partly reflected the impact of L&M, leaving its round \u20ac5 price point in 2015. In Italy, the decline was due largely to the timing of competitors' price increases as well as adult smoker downtrading to the mid and super low price segment.","Regional adjusted OCI increased by 3.5% excluding currency, driven by higher pricing, notably in Germany and Italy and supported by the resilient cigarette industry volume performance. For the full year, we are targeting currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.","In the EEMA region, we recorded strong results in the quarter with adjusted OCI growth of 10.1% excluding currency, driven by Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. In Russia, higher pricing drove another quarter of double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth consistent with our full year target.","Cigarette industry volume declined by 6.8% in the quarter and by 5.3% June year-to-date. Our cigarette market shares decline in the quarter was due mainly to the slower penetration of our competitor's price increases. Given the continued resilience of cigarette industry volume, we now forecast the full year 2016 industry decline of around 7%.","Turkey also recorded solid currency-neutral OCI growth in the quarter, driven by favorable volume mix, reflecting higher cigarette shipment volumes supported by Marlboro and higher pricing. Our strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the EEMA region came despite negative volume mix in North Africa, where general macroeconomic and geopolitcal instability continued to put pressure on cigarette industry volume and premium-priced products, including Marlboro.","In Algeria specifically, Marlboro has also been impacted by the combination of steep excise tax driven price increases earlier this year, and the lower-than-anticipated adult smoker acceptance of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste.","In the Latin American and Canada region, we recorded cigarette share growth of 0.7 points, driven by Brazil and Canada. Marlboro cigarette share increased by 0.4 points, reflecting growth, notably in Brazil.","Currency-neutral adjusted OCI declined in the quarter, due largely to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, following a significant excise tax increase in May which resulted in retail price increases of approximately 50% on an industry weighted average basis. The decline was partially offset by favorable pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada.","Turning now to the Asia region. Our adjusted OCI declined by 5.4% excluding currency. This was due mainly to unfavorable volume mix and higher cost related to the commercialization of iQOS. The lower volume mix was predominantly in Japan, primarily reflecting an unfavorable comparison with the second quarter of 2015, related to distributor inventory movement.","For the full year, we are targeting original adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency, in the mid to high single-digit range, driven in part by a favorable comparison in the fourth quarter.","Our positive full year outlook for the Asia region is supported by favorable developments in several of our key markets. In the Philippines, price gaps between Marlboro and lower priced brands remained stable throughout the quarter and represented a significant narrowing compared to the second quarter of 2015. This continued to support our share growth and positive mix.","In Indonesia, our quarterly market share is beginning to stabilize on a sequential basis and has benefited from our latest launches and geographical expansions in the machine-made kretek segment. For the full year, we are targeting double-digit currency-neutral OCI growth despite the cigarette industry volume decline forecast in the range of 1% to 2%.","In Japan, we're also seeing signs of stabilization in our cigarette market share on a sequential basis after excluding the estimated impact of inventory movement. Marlboro is responding well to the reduced price gap of the leading brand in the market, while recent launches such as Lark 7.0 Splash Purple in the differentiated menthol taste category, are showing positive momentum.","I will now cover iQOS beginning with our exceptional performance in Japan. HeatSticks market share has increased steadily since the national roll out in mid-April, reaching an estimated 2.7% for the last week of June. For the second quarter, HeatSticks market share reached 2.2%, more","than double its first quarter share.","Giving the success of iQOS, we are working to effectively manage our HeatSticks capacity and iQOS device supply to ensure we can meet HeatSticks demand over the balance of 2016.","The performance of iQOS in Japan has been supported by growing adult smoker conversion. Based on our most recent data, 70% of iQOS purchasers have either fully or predominantly converted to it. Our research in Japan also indicates two other positive developments. First, the level of HeatSticks cannibalization from our own cigarette portfolio has declined to around 35% from around 40% when we begin to the initial geographic expansion of iQOS last September. Second, the growth of HeatSticks is resulting in uptrading as adult smokers across all price segments are converting to a premium-priced product.","The strong performance of iQOS in Japan highlighted potential in our other launch market which today are in earlier stages of commercialization and geographic coverage. Importantly, we are seeing encouraging HeatSticks offtake volume trends in all launch market. Chart highlights our weekly indexed offtake volume performance during the first half of 2016 for the launch geographies where iQOS has been present since the beginning of the year.","The commercialization of iQOS continues to progress well across other metrics. As highlighted by Italy and Switzerland, we are generally achieving combined full and predominant conversion levels in line with those in Japan. We're also seeing decreasing cannibalization rate in both Italy and Switzerland consistent with Japan. In addition, iQOS was present in ten markets by the end of June, following this commercialization in select cities in Denmark, Germany and Monaco. We remain on track to launch iQOS in key cities in around 20 markets by the end of this year.","In conclusion, our second quarter results were generally in line with our expectations, reflecting favorable developments across many of our key markets. Total cigarette shipment volume was lower than anticipated due to Argentina, North Africa and Pakistan.","We are making exciting progress with the commercialization of iQOS and are on track with our launch plans for this year. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow and continue to forecast full year 2016 free cash flow, broadly in line with last year's level.","The outlook for 2016 remains strong. We are raising our 2016 report to diluted EPS guidance, which on a currency-neutral basis, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.","Thank you, and I will be now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Jacek, I just wanted to ask two questions about guidance, I guess. One, just from a volume perspective, in the past, you've talked about an expectation for volume declines down 1% to 1.5%, and the industry down 2% to 2.5%. Obviously, you're down about 3% in the first half, so just have your full year expectations changed? And when we look at the impact of a few large excise tax increases like Argentina and Algeria has the excise environment in any way shifted or become more challenging?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","First, on the volume, look, I think at this stage, I think we prefer to say that we will likely, very likely miss our volume expectations, initial expectations for the year. I think we'll come definitely lower than 1.5% decline, which \u2013 1% to 1.5% decline. We might be as low as 3% for the full year. This will be coming from the few geographies which not necessary put a big pressure on our bottom line, but it's \u2013 at this stage, that might be the outlook for the full year.","This obviously may result in some industry volumes to be adjusted accordingly. I think initially we say that the industry somewhere should be in the range of 2% to 2.5%. I think industry might be lower by 2.5%, but we'll have to see, okay, just to be on the cautious side.","Now, when it comes to tax increases, yes, Argentina was a very large increase and resulted in a very high price increase. So there is I think at this moment we could see the impact on the volume, and I think it may continue for some time. Maybe not for the long time because this outsized tax increase happens in the high inflationary market.","I guess the time will be \u2013 will help the consumers to accommodate to the price level, I would argue faster than in other situation. And outside Argentina, frankly speaking, we have not had anything which would be a very disturbing on excise increase. And in Algeria, it's much more \u2013 the whole context of North Africa, the political instability, what is happening at the borders in the individual market countries there.","Plus we have a specific-to-us issue which I highlighted in my remarks connected with the rollout of Architecture 2.0 for the Marlboro Red variant when we had \u2013 I have to admit the first market in which we've been confronted with the less or lower-than-expected acceptance of a new Marlboro. And as you know, we have rolled out new Marlboro to a hundred plus markets, and this is the only market in which we had some significant headwinds from the beginning of the year.","We're obviously working on addressing that thing with marketing perception program, but it may take us some time to address it. So, hopefully, part of that improvement we should see already this year. I hope I answered your questions.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Yeah. Thanks, Jacek. And I guess thanks for clarifying on the volumes. As far as the EPS guidance, you reiterated 10% to 12%, but it seems like it's going to be around 2% through the first nine months, so that, just based on our rough numbers, suggests about 50% growth in Q4 and basically would imply maybe that the margins are similar throughout the year, rather than stepping down in Q4. So I guess mechanically I can see how it works, but if the comparison to last year's elevated spending in fourth quarter seemed to be about a 3% to 4% tailwind for the full year, so in terms of closing the gap and getting up to that 10% to 12% range, are there any other specific factors or sources of flexibility around the timing of reinvestment that you can point to, just to sort of increase our confidence around the levers you have to pull to get up to that level of earnings growth?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Look, for the full year, we said that our total cost, conventional combustible cigarettes and RRPs will not be higher than 1% excluding currency full year 2016 versus full year 2015. Now, for part of this cost and the timing of the cost increases year-on-year are more in the beginning of the year rather than the second half of the year. So, when we enter into Q3, but Q4 very much, we really will have very favorable comparisons not only on the cost line, also on the revenue. I just want to remind that, you may remember the number presumably very well, where the EPS minus almost 4% in Q4 last year, so I mean it clearly will come very strong, with very strong growth this year. And then it just happened, this is a phasing and a timing of the quarters, partially the comp, partially the events of the current year, how we're going to make it. Look, we're very confident of achieving 10% to 12%. But do understand that the pacing of the quarters is not maybe ideal, but the year has four quarters and we're working on delivering the 10% to 12% EPS growth, ex-currency.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks again, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I wanted to circle back with a quick question on the volume deceleration you mentioned in the year. You are now expecting shipment volume to be worse than you originally anticipated, so I guess I'm curious to hear from you, what is offsetting the weaker volume to give you the confidence to maintain your currency-neutral EPS guidance of 10% to 12%? And should we assume growth will be closer to the lower end of that range, given the weaker volume?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Look, it's a difficult question. Thank you, because actually, it reminded me that I forgot to put it in the context of iQOS. That the volumes which we did the guidance or the expectations for the volume which we share obviously on combustible cigarettes, and as you noticed presumably on the quarter already, we started selling quite a significant volume of iQOS which are not included in this number. Now, clearly, iQOS sales or HeatStick sales for the year will, to some extent, offset the volume declines which we have on the combustible business. That's on a positive side, will not fully offset because we have a capacity limitation on the HeatSticks which I will cover in a second.","Having said so, I mean, some of the volumes, which we \u2013 may come short this year. They're coming from the relatively lower margin places except for Algeria, where we have a problem with Marlboro. And in the Pakistan volumes or Philippines volumes, they count in statistics, if you like, but they're not really make a big impact or big change at the bottom line. So we're pretty comfortable, especially Philippines, because the market is losing and we're losing the extremely low margin volumes or zero margin volumes at the bottom of the market and we're having some positive recovery through the mix for Marlboro.","Now, coming to iQOS is that, as you might have noticed, the shipments for the total PMI for iQOS in the quarter to 1.6 billion. They're almost four times higher than what we had in the first quarter, so we can see the dynamics of the acceptance of iQOS. Obviously, it's very much driven by Japan, and we have to be very much focused on Japan this year because we don't have unlimited capacity.","You might remember, we have accelerated the launch plans of all markets, including Japan by about a year, not being fully ready on the manufacturing side. Initially, our capacity was to be in the range of 5 billion units. We have made some efforts to increase that capacity by a billion or so this year, but I wouldn't expect any further miracles on the capacity this year, and we may continue with some pressure on capacity for the beginning of this year.","We are right now revising our CapEx plans, and we, in order to accelerate not only the increase or the acceleration of the 30 billion capacity plant which we're building in Italy in order to be able to satisfy the market demand.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I actually did want to ask you also about what you're seeing in Japan with iQOS. You called out in the press release your combustible cig share in Japan was 25.8%, and then for iQOS, your HeatSticks, I should say 2.2% and you noted that your combined national share in Japan is 27.5% which is a nice share gain of over two share points versus the year ago period. So I was hoping you could talk about the rate of cannibalization from iQOS that you're seeing, it seems maybe low. And are you seeing lower cannibalization in Japan, for instance, versus other markets? I'd just love to hear sort of the differences in cannibalization rates by market.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","We did, and we do indeed see a better cannibalization, i.e. lower cannibalization rate in Japan now as we had six or so months ago. So I had the numbers and mentioned the numbers in my remarks. I mean that's a pretty nice improvement. And we see the same in other places, okay, in other markets outside Japan, although obviously, we're in a much more focused smaller territories, et cetera. Now Japan's share which we have disclosed today allowed us to leave the total corporate share, i.e., for both combined territories by more than two points. I think that's significant especially in Japan.","Now, what's more important, if you look at the exit shares of June, so if I take the last week, the last two weeks, how it's been accruing in Japan, we have crossed the five points, 5% share of market mark in Tokyo, okay. And we're still growing. So I mean the volume growth is somewhere in the range of about 20% plus on a monthly basis. So we could see the push, we could see the consumers coming to iQOS stores and to other places in which devices are available. Almost fully prepared, fully, one could say converted already to the use of iQOS as the conversion rates are doubled of what we had at the beginning of our iQOS journey in Japan. We estimate, Bonnie, that at this point in time, we must have about 600,000 exclusive or fully switch users of iQOS in Japan, essentially translated the 600,000 people in Japan who quit combustible smoking and they fully adopted iQOS. I think it's spectacular.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great to hear. Thanks for the color there. And just one final question, if I may, on your margins. Your operating margins were down 200 bps in the quarter. So I guess I'm trying to understand what some of the key drivers of the margin contraction were? Also curious to understand why margins were down this much, considering your volume","declines that you mentioned in the quarter were really mainly in the low margin geographies. So I guess I would have assumed you would have had a little bit more of a positive mix there?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","I think the inventory comps in which we had, and the shipments driven comps which we had in Japan were very much behind the PMI and the Asia margins. I mean you're talking about 1.9 billion difference in the shipments in Japan on the conventional cigarettes, on the combustible cigarette, and this would clearly give you the impact just from that in the north of $70 million. So I think that is what we've been missing.","We have \u2013 the way we're looking at this thing also is lifting the margins Q2 to Q1 because we ended up Q1 with not so great margins and I think sequentially we're going up, and I think we will have more of the margin improvement for the year when the pricing realization is getting usually stronger in a number of places. We have much better situations with the pricing in Ukraine which relative to a lot of other margins in Q1, a bit less or much less in Q2. And I think that things are going in the right direction. And as I said, I mean some of the volume headwinds which we have going forward, except for Algeria, they're not really coming from a high unit margin countries.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Jacek, I wanted to ask about pricing. In 2Q, your pricing variance of $344 million is still tracking a bit below kind of the full year run rate. So I know you called out a couple of factors, but maybe if you can just quantify the key drivers. And then it sounds like you're still expecting a 6% pricing variance for the full year which implies a big acceleration in the back half, so just wanted to get your comfort level around that. And then related to that, you also called out some increased promotional support on iQOS, it sounds like in Japan that kind of hurt pricing, so maybe you can give us some more color on that as well.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Okay. I think the first half of the year Q1, a bit of Q2, is still impacted by Korea, right, so the price realization obviously looks at the lower level due to the comps. And as we had quite significant price reductions in Ukraine at the beginning of the year which I just mentioned a moment ago is phasing out and the situation is improving. So Korea impacting the outer quarters is no longer there, negative drag is no longer there. Ukraine should get better, plus we have a pricing which was taken in the quarter. So I think we'll have more of the realizations. Indonesia always plays a significant role, because beginning of the year, they're not really in the net price increases. Now they're moving into the positive price territories. So I think the 6% is achievable and I think we feel confident about this.","There is a pricing \u2013 some price negativity due to the allowances of discounts which we're giving to the iQOS purchasers, not the HeatSticks purchasers in Japan. And although over a period of time, we have reduced in the end, per device discount, due to the higher volume of the devices which we're selling, I mean that puts a little bit of a negative on the pricing variance due to the allowances behind iQOS. But on the other hand, you always pre-sell devices first and then the HeatSticks with the adoptions rate are following very soon. And the HeatSticks actually are bringing the whole margin to the business. I think that's on a positive side.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's helpful. And then I was hoping to get a little bit more color on Russia. I think your industry volume forecast is now a little bit better, down 7% for the full year. But it seems like your market share trends have worsened, particularly in kind of the low- to mid-priced brands. So, when you compare the situation this year versus last year where you were actually gaining share, what sort of changed in terms of the market share performance? Is it kind of your decision to not be as aggressive in the low- to mid-priced brands from a pricing perspective? Has the competitive landscape gotten worse? So just color on Russia.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","No. I think from the beginning of the year, we observed a bit of lower or slower price implementation from competition. So, yes, I mean I think I have said already in Q1 that we might feel some share pressure in Russia. We just stick to our plan and then we target double-digit OCI growth and I think we can deliver on that. I mean a part of this share pressure is literally the timing of the price implementation. So I don't think there is anything fundamentally broken with the brand. It's just the temporary opening of the price gaps in the market. So I wouldn't be too much worried about this. On the positive side, I mean, you remember, initially, we thought that the market with this price in mind should stay about a 9% or so decline since the elasticity continues to be on the more positive side for us. So I think 7% is the recent outlook for the industry volumes. I think we should be okay. Also, important is that we see a guidance-to-guidance improvement on global exchange rates. So I think that the whole pressure on the Russian economy is a little bit less which is improving a bit than initially we thought.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So just if I can clarify, the pricing, the timing of the price increases and the competitive actions, are, at this point, all of your competitors now in line with your pricing?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","They're all in line with the pricing but if I would be \u2013 for example, 80% of price implementations, coverage of the product with the new price in every retail outlet in Russia, competitions might be at the 60% or 50%.It's just rolling out the prices. The price increase does not just happen at the one day in all outlets, okay. Shipping the old product, new product, more of the new product, the new priced product. This is a typical price implementation in Russia, and actually in many other places as well.","So we just see that the prices which they implemented in the market are in line with \u2013 if you like our pricing. It's just they have less of distribution, if you like, of their product with the new prices than us in a given moment in time. So, obviously, in this outlet, when the price gap is opening, at least temporarily, some of our brands might feel pressure.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's clear. And then just last question, just quickly on currency. So, on the yen, obviously it has been a big favorable move in the last few months, so wanted to just get an update on your hedged position on the yen? How much you're covered for this year, and what the effective hedge rate is for this year?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, with the forecasted cash flows, et cetera, from Japan for this year, we are about 70% hedged, and I think it was the first quarter in a long time when effective rate of the yen this quarter was by a bit but better than the effective rate of a yen the same quarter last year. So we're essentially moving the yen into positive territory.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Look, just wanted to follow up on iQOS. Sorry to belabor the point, but certainly your results are very encouraging. As we think about the outsized demand that you're seeing in Japan, how has that influenced your outlook for spend more broadly in the 20 markets that you're targeting?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we're still aiming at commercializing iQOS in the 20 cities market by the year-end. Obviously, as I mentioned earlier, I mean we have to bear in mind that we don't have a fully available capacity, and we are today in a situation that we have a national coverage \u2013 the only place where we have a national coverage is Japan.","And we know that those who switch to iQOS, so 600,000-plus consumers in Japan, we cannot put them in a situation of out-of-stock because they themselves told us that after two or three weeks of smoking iQOS, they actually don't want to, don't like to and they cannot switch back to cigarette.","So we're a little bit trapped now in this situation that we have to make sure that Japan has a continuity of supply before we start put foot stronger on the pedal in other places. So we're preparing our iQOS stores. I think by now we have more than 20 flagship stores in a number of geographies obviously including Japan.","We're preparing the Internet. We're preparing the sales force to the whole commercialization, so we can start. We're recruiting the first consumers, the first smokers in these places. But frankly speaking, at this stage, throwing more resources would just generate a higher demand. And we are not in a situation where when we can meet the demand with our supply constraints at this moment in time. So this is how we have to work.","The second market which is close to national expansion, not full expansion, is Switzerland. And in Switzerland, we started moving, if you remember the market share in the German part, I think we grew the volumes in that part by about 50% quarter-on-quarter. We continue growing the market share in the French part. I think we crossed about a 2% market share at the end of Q2. So it's not in our interest now, knowing that we don't have a continuity of supply at this moment, to push too much on iQOS.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you. And just to follow up on that. When you're referring to kind of national distribution, should I understand that to mean that you've got kind of 100% of your targeted retail penetration in a market like Japan or you're getting close to that in Switzerland? Or are there more stores you that want to enter?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Japan I guess is fully covered now. I mean there may be a few outlets, okay. We have some limitations on the device sales because the only way we can manage the constraints on the HeatStick capacity is to limit the iQOS device sales. And actually to be frank, in all outlets in Japan, key accounts, general trade, et cetera, there are the purchase limits per store. And I think we're shipping the product only twice a week with very limited quantities in order to stop or slow down the conversion because it will result in a higher demand for the HeatSticks. And the HeatStick is a bottleneck which we have for now. And the same applies, to large extent, to other places.","Now if I compare Switzerland, I think iQOS is now available in 200-plus outlets. So we're not really in the full national coverage in any of these places. Moscow, we're in a couple of stores. We have one store in Lisbon. So it's really very small. But if I look at the volume trend which you might remember from my presentation a few minutes ago, the volume trends are extremely encouraging. I mean you have a truly exponential growth.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","It's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Just coming back to currency, I know it's early to look ahead to next year. But in our numbers, it looks like you've actually got a slight tailwind which of course we haven't really talked about for a long time. Just very roughly, does that seem accurate? And I guess related to that, can you just remind us some of your thinking about if and when you would consider resuming buyback?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, Michael, look, I wish I knew what the currency's going to be next year. But let me put that way, we had headwind on the currency for the last three years. So I think it would be very fair if some of this headwind converged into tailwind to us. Now once we have a strong tailwind on the currency, I think we might be then only in the situations to reconsider the buyback.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Would it be fair to say that you want to be careful so that you don't resume buybacks just to have to suspend them again? Is that part of how you think about it?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, we'd rather \u2013 I think if we were to arrange the buyback, we would like to see the positive outlook for the next few years, so have something of the, I guess more longer lasting program than just one quarter or one year with the buyback. Remember, our focus always more strategically is on the dividend and creating the room for the dividend growth. And buyback comes \u2013 after all of other opportunities to invest, I mean buyback will come last.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","No, that's helpful. Thanks. And then back on iQOS, can you remind us when full capacity comes online? I think you've said the end of this year, but how specific can you be? And then related to that, you have acceleration in, looks like every market, especially Japan which is the biggest, if that continues, is it possible you might need to postpone the other 10 markets that you expect to launch in this year just to be able to keep servicing the ones where you're already present?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, the other markets which we have in a plan for this year is they will \u2013 I think postponing the market would delay the entire commercializations. And we know that as of Q1, Q2 latest next year, based on our sales forecast obviously, we should be in a comfortable capacity territory. So I think we rather let the market go as we had per plan. One iQOS store will not put that much of a stretch initially on our capacity which is very mindful in the developments in Japan because that's every few percentage error on the forecast which we have translates into tens of hundreds of millions of HeatSticks. And this is where the focus is for the time being.","Capacity, the initial plan of the building, the factory for 30 billion, we're actually accelerating that delivery of that capacity. And as I said, as of Q1, we should month-by-month see the progression in available capacity, but this is obviously confronted with the pretty steep growth curve which we have in Japan. So we have a little bit of a vicious cycle on this side, but we're right now also working on resolving that problem.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","But so just to clarify, I think you've got the 5 billion to 6 billion capacity out of Neuch\u00e2tel, the plant in Italy, when would that come online?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","We already started producing in Italy, okay. We're producing a little bit in still in a development center in Neuch\u00e2tel in Switzerland, and this is mainly to keep demand satisfied in Switzerland. And Bologna plant, both the training center and the new factory actually started producing the HeatSticks and they're already shipping everything to Japan and a few other places. So to start a factory from the structural perspective and infrastructure is ready. We're just in the phase of installing the machines. So there is a phase of installing the production line. And every month we will be better with the capacity. But we cannot just install 30 billion in one go. 30 billion translates into X number of machine groups, and one by one have to be installed, tested and moved into commercial production.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful color. And then just lastly on Italy, it looks like in your one slide you've shown an acceleration in momentum there from the beginning of the year. Obviously, that's a market where there have been relatively little traction. How much has that picked up? What kind of share are you seeing now? It seems I'm guessing still pretty small. But what have you seen made a difference that it's better than it was?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Because we see the higher conversion than we initially had, so Italy, like Japan, a month ago started with 30% or so conversion. And I think Italy is approaching 70% conversions. From every hundred devices which we sell, iQOS devices which we sell, 70 devices are in permanent use, so a consumer is fully switched to iQOS. And that share for total Italy is not a firm number because we're not really present in whole Italy, we're taking the places where we are, and assuming that we properly can estimate an underlying market in these places, it's a little bit of science and art actually together.","I think we're approaching about a 0.3%, maybe above the 0.3% in the market share. So versus where we've been at the beginning, remember, Milan was for the long time 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.2% to 0.3% is quite a significant improvement. If I take it from a volume perspective, I mean we see in Italy, like in other places, about 20% volume growth every month, month by month. So we're starting with a slow base, I admit this thing, but the growth is there.","So I think the moment when we'll be able to amplify Italy to the national coverage like we did in Japan, obviously, we need to discount the different channels of communications which we have available in Italy versus in Japan. But I think the prospects are there. I think we should see more and more of Japan \u2013 of Italy improvement or strong performance towards in the second part of the year. And the trend of the volume trend as of Q1, Q2 which you had on the slide in my part of the presentation is just highlighted. We start pushing the right buttons there.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","That's helpful.

Just a quick one from me.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Philip Gorham - Morningstar Holland BV","Clearly last month or so, we've had a number of geopolitical shocks, and I appreciate it's early days, but have you seen any signs in your categories in any of the effective markets that the consumer is in any way sort of changing their spending behavior. Thanks, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Well, you have some downtrading in some places in the North Africa, Egypt which, as you know, the macro economic situation is challenging. And Egypt will remain on the watch list for the remainder of the year.

Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a news release containing detailed information on our 2019 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI\u2019s Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations, and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site.","Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products.

I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?","Martin King","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our third quarter results continued to reflect strong underlying business performance. The results include the better-than-anticipated timing of pricing and costs compared to our previously communicated assumptions for the quarter.","Our reported results in the quarter were impacted by an after-tax charge in Russia of $315 million, related to a final assessment by the Moscow Tax Authorities on excise taxes and VAT for the 2015 to 2017 period. Additional detail on this charge is provided in today's press release.","Total shipment volumes in the third quarter declined by 1.4%. Excluding the net favorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements due primarily to the heated tobacco unit inventory reduction in Japan during the third quarter of 2018, our total in-market sales volume declined by 3.6%, reflecting lower cigarette volume, partly offset by strong heated tobacco unit volume growth.","Approximately two-thirds of the total in-market sales volume decline was due to three markets, in two of which, the decreases were largely timing related. In Pakistan, our cigarette volume was down by approximately 50%, broadly in line with the industry decline reflecting the timing of excise tax increase announcements compared to last year, as well as the impact of price increases.","In Turkey, our cigarette volume decline was due mainly to the impact of two price increases this year, totaling TRY5 per pack or roughly 44% on a weighted-average basis, which disproportionately impacted our share, given the timing of our price increases vis-\u00e0-vis the competition. In Indonesia, our cigarette volume declined, mainly reflected lower share, primarily due to widened price gaps between our brands and the competition\u2019s, as well as a lower total market.","Heated tobacco unit shipment volume reached 16 billion units in the quarter. Excluding the net favorable impact of inventory movements, primarily related to third-quarter 2018 inventory reduction in Japan, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 28.3%, driven by the EU and Eastern Europe Regions. HTU shipment volume in the quarter was in line with our HTU in-market sales volume of 15.9 billion units.","Third-quarter net revenues increased by 7%, excluding currency, driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by lower cigarette shipment volume. RRP net revenues reached $1.3 billion in the quarter, or over 17% of PMI's total net revenues. It is worth noting that our year-to-date September RRP net revenues of $4.1 billion have essentially reached the full-year 2018 total.","We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 5.9% in the quarter, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Russia, and Turkey. On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 8%, while adjusted operating income margin grew by 40 basis points. This margin expansion was achieved despite net incremental investment behind RRPs in the quarter of approximately $170 million and was driven primarily by favorable geographic mix related to HTUs, reflecting the increased contribution of volume from IQOS geographies with relatively high unit margins, notably markets in the EU region.","Our adjusted operating income and margin also benefited from the timing of costs as certain expenditures initially planned for the third quarter were not incurred by quarter-end. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 5.9% excluding currency. The lower currency neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share compared to adjustable operating income notably reflected the high relative growth contribution in the quarter from markets with sizable non-controlling interest, for example, the Philippines with a non-controlling interest of 50%.","Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., was essentially stable in the third quarter, reflecting lower share for cigarettes, offset by higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.3%. Our share of the cigarette category declined by 0.4 points, reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS, particularly in the EU region, Japan and Russia, coupled with lower share, notably in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea, Mexico, and Turkey.","Importantly, Marlboro share of the cigarette category increased by 0.2 points to 10.2%, driven by Germany, the Philippines, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. The share decline in Indonesia primarily reflects the impact of widened price gaps between Sampoerna A, notably a mild and competitive brand, particularly at the bottom of the market.","As you may recall, we increased our prices in Indonesia late last year in anticipation of a 2019 excise tax increase that ultimately did not materialize. Our competitors largely maintained their prices, particularly following the government's decision to leave cigarette excise taxes unchanged, leading to the widened price gaps with our brands this year.","Although, no formal regulation has yet been issued, the government recently outlined a 2020 cigarette excise tax with an average increase of 23% in exercise and 35% in the minimum band roll price. As the government has not yet announced the increase for each individual tax year, it is difficult to accurately gauge the anticipated volume and share impact in 2020. We do note, however, that while the potential tax pass on is relatively steep in the context of the two-year stack with no excise tax increase in 2019, the average percentage increase is broadly in line with historical levels.","Turning now to a more detailed discussion of RRP performance. We estimate that there were approximately $12.4 million IQOS users as of quarter end. We further estimate that 71% of the total or some 8.8 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion.","IQOS is now commercially available in 51 markets, following recent launches in Belarus, the United Arab Emirates and in the United States. We are particularly excited by the launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria. The first IQOS retail store has opened in the initial lead market of Atlanta, Georgia, marking a historic milestone in providing better alternatives to the 40 million men and women in the U.S. who smoke. IQOS is currently the only heat-not-burn product on the market authorized through the U.S. food and drug administration's PMTA pathway as, \"appropriate for the protection of public health\".","As you are aware, the merger discussions with Altria have ended. Although, this chapter is definitively closed, we have an ongoing relationship with Altria, and both companies will focus on maximizing the IQOS opportunity in the U.S. market. Last month, we took another important step in our journey towards a smoke free future with the launch of IQOS 3 DUO. This latest edition to the IQOS family was designed with enhanced features to help adult smokers switch more seamlessly from cigarettes.","IQOS 3 DUO allows two consecutive uses without recharging the holder. While it's charging time is significantly faster compared to IQOS 3, and IQOS 2.4 plus. IQOS 3 DUO is currently available in Japan and will be rolled out in most markets where IQOS is commercially available by the end of this year, further strengthening our smoke free leadership position.","Let me now take you through the performance of IQOS in the quarter. In the markets where IQOS has been commercialized, excluding the U.S., our HTU brands recorded a total combined share of 5.1% despite not yet being nationally distributed in many of them. At this share level, our HTU brands would collectively be the fourth largest tobacco brand in these markets, up from number six in the third quarter of last year.","In the EU region where we are commercializing IQOS in areas representing approximately 57% of total industry volume, share for each more than doubled in the quarter to reach 2.5%. This growth reflects continued strength across a broad range of markets as detailed in the HTU market share appendix included at the end of today's presentation.","On a sequential basis, share increased by 0.1 point compared to the second quarter. Given the impact of higher industry cigarette sales volume reflecting summer seasonality, we believe that this sequential share performance understates the favorable momentum of HEETS. To this point, the end market sales volume for HEETS increased by over 9% sequentially versus the second quarter.","IQOS continued its strong performance in Russia in the quarter with HEETS share up by 2.9 points to reach 4%. On a sequential basis versus the second quarter, HEETS share increased by 1.1 points while in market sales increased by over 40% to reach 2.4 billion units. HEETS share growth in the quarter was consistent with the pace of adult smokers and our geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in cities, representing approximately half of the market by total industry volume compared to an estimated 40% at the end of the second quarter.","In Japan, our total share for HeatSticks and HEETS increased by 1.5 points to reach 17% in the quarter. The initiatives that we introduced during the second quarter of last year continued to pay off and drove a step up in our share performance. On a sequential basis, the share for our HTU brands was up by 0.4 points or stable after adjusting for the estimated impact of trade loading in advance of the October 1st tax and price increases.","Importantly, our weekly off take share increased sequentially during the quarter, reaching over 18% by the end of September. While we acknowledge that our off take shares toward the end of the period may have been favorably impacted by consumer loading ahead of the October 1st, our share growth continues in the first week of this month.","We are encouraged by our HTU share performance in the face of increased competitive activity as the year has progressed. While the growing number of smoke-free devices and consumables has contributed to competitive churn, IQOS remains the market leader with approximately 73% of HTU category share despite accounting for only around 20% of category SKUs. We believe the launch of IQOS 3 DUO will further reinforce the IQOS family's leadership position. This will be complemented by recent line extensions in our HeatSticks and HEETS line-ups.","In Korea, the heated tobacco category remains highly competitive, particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions that are also present in the cigarette category. HEETS share in the third quarter declined by 1.2 points or by 1 point on an adjusted basis. Share for HEETS was also down sequentially versus the second quarter.","However, we began to see early signs of stabilization in HEETS off take segment share over the course of the third quarter, supported by recent launches that expanded the flavor line-up. While we are encouraged by this trend, we have a lot of work to do to reinforce the heated tobacco category's benefits and build upon IQOS's leadership position. In this regard, we look forward to the upcoming roll-out of IQOS 3 DUO.","Turning now to our full-year outlook. As announced in today's press release, we are revising our 2019 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.73. The $0.21 decrease, compared to our prior guidance on July 18th of at least $4.94, was predominantly due to the $315 million after-tax charge in Russia, noted earlier. Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact, at prevailing exchange rates, of approximately $0.14 per share.","After excluding the reporting adjustments and tax items outlined on this slide, our forecast continues to represent a projected currency-neutral increase of at least 9% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018. Our guidance continues to assume an industry total volume decline in 2019 of approximately 2.5%, excluding China and the U.S.","As a result of recent cigarette price increases in selected markets, notably the Philippines and Turkey, we now assume a full-year total shipment volume decline rate of 1% to 1.5%, versus approximately 1% previously. This revision solely reflects changes to our full-year cigarette shipment volume outlook. We continue to anticipate full-year HTU shipments volume broadly in line with our HTU in-market sales volume with any inventory movements this year in individual markets, essentially offsetting on an aggregate basis.","We are maintaining our full year assumption of currency neutral net revenue growth of at least 6%. This now reflects a higher combustible tobacco pricing variance of approximately 6%, compared to above 5% previously, which is effectively offset by the impact of our revised total shipment volume target. While we continue to anticipate net incremental investments behind RRPs of approximately $400 million, excluding currency, we are refining our currency neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion assumption for the year to approximately 150 basis points from at least 100 basis points previously.","In addition, please note that we now expect the full year contribution of IQOS devices to total RRP net revenues to be approximately 15% compared to below 20% previously. This primarily reflects the favorable geographic mix impact of greater HTU volume in relatively high margin geographies, notably markets in the EU region, the longer lifespan of the latest IQOS devices compared to prior versions, and the impact of IQOS device retail price changes in select markets.","We now anticipate full year operating cash flow of approximately $9.2 billion subject to year-end working capital requirements. The change, compared to our prior assumptions of approximately $9.5 billion, reflects the impact of the after-tax charge in Russia. Separately, we now expect 2019 capital expenditures of approximately $1 billion, compared to approximately $1.1 billion previously.","Dividends remain the primary use of our operating cash flow after capital expenditures. Last month, we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 2.6% to $1.17 per share. This equates to a total quarterly dividend of approximately $1.8 billion, or approximately $7.3 billion annually.","To close on our full year guidance and assumptions, I would like to touch on our anticipated fourth quarter performance. Importantly, we expect currency neutral net revenue and adjusted operating income growth to be in line with our year-to-date September results. However, our currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth will be lower than our year-to-date September performance due to the following factors.","An unfavorable income tax rate comparison of roughly 4 percentage points versus the fourth quarter of 2018, during which our three month tax rate benefitted from the full year impact of further clarifications related to the U.S. tax reform. And a continued high relative adjusted operating income growth contribution from markets with sizable non-controlling interest. We expect these two factors to serve as a drag of approximately 9 percentage points on our fourth quarter currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth rate compared to our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.17 in the fourth quarter of 2018.","To conclude, we recorded strong underlying business performance in the third quarter, reflecting the quality of our execution against each of the key metrics of net revenues, operating income, margin and diluted EPS on a currency neutral adjusted basis. The fundamentals supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio are intact. The favorable momentum for IQOS continues across geographies, further supporting our confidence in our HTU shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021. We are excited by the recent launch of IQOS in the U.S. and the global launch of IQOS 3 DUO.","Finally, on a currency neutral basis, we are maintaining our full-year 2019 growth assumption for net revenues of at least 6%, and our anticipated full year 2019 growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS of at least 9%.","Thank you. I'm now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will not conduct a question-and-answer portion of conference. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","My first question for you, and I think you did a good job explaining from a high level just that you do have more pricing coming through in the combustible business in relation, and therefore there is a negative volume implication, certainly in this quarter there was. Is that just -- was the timing to tax increases or were there certain markets you'd call out, if you said those I'm sorry I missed them, but . I just want to get a little more color on that to understand the implication to the guidance for year and for volume?","Martin King","Yes, the two markets to call out are Turkey and Philippines. Remember, in Turkey, we had a tax increase back in April, and the pass on was about TRY4.20. And at the time, we took TRY2 shortly thereafter, amidst a lot of scrutiny on inflation from the government. At the time, also, the other competitors did not move immediately and we lost quite a bit of share. And now we've been able to take another TRY3 in August, which the other competitors also followed immediately.","And so, you're seeing basically our opportunity to take pricing in Turkey come with the situation. We're taking it as soon as we can, but we're in fact a little bit late. Now, we've been able to pass the full tax and a little bit more. So, we're on track in turkey after having to delay a bit the pricing from what we would have normally done.","And the second one to call out is the Philippines. There was a tax increase announced to take effect in January 2020. The tax goes from 35 pesos per pack to 45 pesos per pack, and you're seeing us move ahead of that with pricing that started already in August, late August, now that we have clarity on the tax to come, and also because in Philippines, once the tax is clear, the trade will tend to try to buy more volume and take some of the benefits from the tax increase.","So those two are situations where we're taking pricing as we can get it. We were obviously doing very well with volume through the first half of the year. And you see us now in the second half moving a little more with pricing in a couple of markets. But if you look at -- stand back and look at the full year picture, where we're saying volume down 1 to 1.5, pricing at 6%. It's actually a pretty good balance. And our overall share for the year we anticipate to be positive against the industry decline of 2.5.","So when you look at the bigger picture long term, it's a very nice balanced mix between volume, share, and pricing.","Chris Growe","I just had a second question, if I could, in relation to IQOS and RRPs. And you have a -- if my math is right here, if my numbers are right. You have -- you had inventory builds, I'm trying to get to in RRPs year-to-date. Does that come out in the fourth quarter as we think about your inventory that being a factor for your shipments for the year? You did mention that in-market sales should roughly approximate your shipments. So, I just want to put those two numbers. And then just to think about your RRP revenue in the fourth quarter, have you given any color around that sort of the degree to which that should grow, with the degree to which these inventory changes, if they do occur, could weigh on that in the quarter?","Martin King","Let me be crystal clear on RRP HTU inventory. There has been no inventory build and there will be no inventory build for this year. Our in-market sales and our shipments for the full year will be approximately the same, and they were also -- even in the quarter, we had 16 billion of shipments and 15.9 billion of in-market sales.","What you're seeing, Chris, I think maybe there's some confusion, is it last year in the third quarter, we drew inventories down in Japan, in particular, around 4 billion units. So, the reference to ex-inventory is so that you can compare apples-to-apples, what it is essentially saying is add 4 billion back to last year to make the comparisons equal. But this year, our inventories are flat for HTUs and so forth. And in fact, we don't anticipate, by the end of the year, any inventory builds really in HTUs or cigarettes. We should end the year fairly lean on inventory.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Looking at Indonesia, you've called out the volume headwinds in this quarter, but on a year, you're slightly up. How do you reconcile that with the price gaps that you've cited as a headwind for the quarter? And then just looking ahead, what should we think for the outlook for the market? I know you don\u2019t have some of the tax tier detail yet, but in terms of just where you sit from the category standpoint, can you give a sense of what 2020 might look like?","Martin King","So, for Indonesia, the overall market so far this year is up slightly. As you would expect with no tax increase and very muted pricing, we are losing some share. As we mentioned in the script, the price gap between our premium brands and the low end is hurting our share, but it's also causing some mix erosion as volume trades down. We do have some new initiatives at the lower price tiers that we're doing very well, but within our portfolio, we're being dragged by mix, as well as by the overall share loss. And so our shipments for the year are coming in slightly negative -- year-to-date are coming in slightly negative as well.","Now as far as the situation in Indonesia, going forward, the government has said they're going to increase the tax. They've used the number 23%. It's not final and hasn't been released, particularly by taxed year. They've also said though that the banderole price, minimum price would go by 35%, which would have a very positive effect from the point of view of this mix issue, because it would cause the low end of the market to move up and close some of the gaps that have been the biggest problem for government revenue collection, as well as for our own mix issues.","Now the total volume, it's hard to estimate, going forward, until we see the details, on both the increased the amount but also by individual tiers. But overall when you look at the increase of tax of 23% over two year period and realize that the pass on actual retail price is lower than the full 23%, it's not a disaster from that point of view. Although, we will have the challenge next year of going into the year without a lot of annualization of pricing that we normally have because of the way the Indonesian market works with lots of small price increases.","So Indonesia, I guess the longer term big picture, resetting the gaps, perhaps having a chance to address some of this mixed issue, is net positive. However, the challenge for next year will be the overall lack of annualization on pricing and the potential impact on the volume due to the relatively larger size increase all at once as opposed to coming over a period of time. So we'll wait and see what Indonesia unfolds. But it gives us some opportunities as well.","Michael Lavery","And just on Japan, you've called out some headwinds from down trading as well for the cigarillos. Can you just give a sense of how to think about that segment? And is there more of a headline from that going forward we should anticipate?","Martin King","Yes, there are couple of things to know about the cigarillos segment. One is it's not considered in the cigarettes and HTUs to overall cigarette volume that we've been using as the basis. So as cigarillos grow, we may have some distortions coming from that that we'll have to explain in quarters going forward, and we'll break that out for you.","The cigarillo category benefits from a preferential tax, if you will. We don't know whether this will last. Likely, I think eventually, the government will close this situation, because cigarillos, for example, can be priced below cigarettes at the bottom of the market and still have higher margins. Now, it was initially a category that was opened and JT, when the Class D product separate tax category phased out, they actually transferred some of the Class C brands over into cigarillos.","So we would guesstimate that, probably by the end of this year, it could be $3 billion to $4 billion total year number for cigarillos. So it's starting to get big enough to have an impact on the total market. Obviously, we all think this category should have preferential tax going forward. But we'll have to monitor this situation and decide we ourselves would have to compete in it at some point in order to not be at a disadvantage.","But overall, I think the situation in Japan with our focus being on heated tobacco and IQOS, and the real benefits coming from our gains in those categories, are a net positive right now.","Michael Lavery","One quick last one. You mentioned in duty free some headwinds from China, in particular, having a little bit more enforcement on what people are allowed to bring in to that market. Clearly, there's some consumer interest in that country. Can you give an update on what if any status change you may have had in your negotiations with CNTC to potentially launch with some sort of joint venture, or something in China?","Martin King","I really don't have any news with regards to our cooperations with CNTC. We continue to hope that the RRPs and IQOS in particular is an area for potential cooperation, but we don't have any additional progress on that. You're right. Duty free numbers have been affected by the fact that the allowances, the amount of a product that individual tourists or travellers are allowed to bring back into China, has been reduced and more strictly enforced. And that is having impact on what was a very robust duty free business of HTU, not just to travellers from China but other countries as well.","And you see in the numbers for the Middle East, Africa, duty free that HTU is down this quarter. It's partly because of the comparison whereas last year we were ramping up and building some inventory that deal with higher sales. This year, we're in a reverse situation where we're bringing some of the volume down in order to account for the new situation with the traveller limits. So it's pretty big swing but it's -- in the grand scheme of things, it's not major. And as I said before, the total sales and shipments for our heated tobacco units around the world were equal for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I have a question on your guidance for Q4. You mentioned EPS growth will be below year-to-date trend. So just wondering how much lower? You talked about, I think, a 9 point drive from the factors you mentioned, Martin. But shouldn't that be offset by your expectations for stronger margin expansion? So just trying to get a sense if you're expecting Q4 EPS growth closer to your full year guidance of 9% or below? And I guess I'm really trying to get a sense of how conservative this might be, especially given the momentum you're seeing in your business?","Martin King","The answer is we expect IT to be well below the EPS number, or below where we have been year-to-date. We would expect the operating income and revenues to be in line with where we are year-to-date. But the drop off from operating income to earnings per share is quite steep, driven primarily by this big difference in corporate tax rate. Last year in the fourth quarter, we were catching up on positive news and interpretations of the U.S. tax act, and we have the benefits for the full year hitting in one quarter. So we had a relatively low corporate tax rate in the fourth quarter last year.","This year, it's little bit of a different story that we're slightly behind our 23% projection for the full year so far through the year. So in the fourth quarter, we would expect the tax rate to make up that difference and bring us back to 23%. So the gap between the two years is 4 percentage points, which is pretty big impact. And then on top of that, you have this non-controlling interest line, which is being as effective as it's already even in Q3 you see it, but it's even more pronounced in Q4.","The two markets we called out with significant pricing, just to put it in perspective. In Turkey, the pricing was over 40% and in Philippines, it was just below 40% at 37%. So these two markets with very significant pricing are bringing bigger increases than other markets obviously in operating income et cetera. However, they have non-controlling interest. We called out Philippines with 50% non-controlling interest. So you're sharing some of that big increase with your partners. And therefore, the step down of those two, the tax and the non-controlling interest, we call that as a 9 percentage point drag versus the number last year, which was $1.17 on the adjusted pro forma basis. So it's a very large gap between the OI and the EPS number, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","And then actually I wanted to ask you about the deal talks with Altria, if I may. I know they've ended. But I'd be curious to hear why you considered merging with Altria to begin with? And then why the timing was right? And I guess when the talks started, I'd like to hear from you how you were thinking about the U.S. market, and then how that in fact maybe changed given of course, the talks have ended? And then just in terms of talking with some of the investors over the last month, month and half. There was a fair amount of concern that maybe you were seeing something in your business that made you feel compelled to maybe seek a deal. So if you could just touch on that, I think that would be really helpful. Thank you.","Martin King","So Altria discussions were a natural outgrowth. The fact that we were launching IQOS in the U.S., we had PMTA approval. So it's natural, I think, for the two companies to sit down and discuss whether that's the best arrangement or whether there was other alternatives, for example, a merger. And whenever you're looking at a merger between two companies the first thing you start to look for are our strategic benefits, primarily synergies around revenue. And in our case, obviously, it was about RRP portfolios and having the right product mix for the future of a combined company potentially, having a better opportunity with wider range of products. We were looking at the U.S. market being very profitable, very large, 20 billion profitability in that market, with growing profitability over time.","Obviously, you look at cost synergies, although, that wasn't really a key driver here. And then regulatory synergies, because from our perspective the U.S. market has pretty big role in setting the regulatory framework for the world. So we looked at all these different categories and then we put it also into the larger context. And one of the big things was the environment was developing rather rapidly as we were in these discussions with all the news around e-vapor and the regulatory approach from FDA, et cetera.","We also got pretty clear feedback from our shareholders. We have lot of questions about whether this would make sense. And shareholders feeling that they could, if they wanted to, be exposed to the U.S. market by Altria separately, they didn't need PMI to do that. So we obviously heard quite a bit from shareholders. And then of course, you have the distraction, the management that would come with overcoming the environment, the shareholder feedback, and so forth.","So in the end, both management teams decided that the best path was for us to collectively focus on IQOS success in the U.S., which incidentally as this was developing became even more of an opportunity, because we felt that the environments gave IQOS even more of a chance since it's the only heated tobacco market with FDA, PMTA authorization. And so we've chosen this path. We are definitively done with merger discussions. We've chosen the path of working with Altria on IQOS. The merger is off the table. And we're going down a path, which is very promising and we're very happy with.","Now as far as concerns about whether this was some way to offset results. I think this quarter's numbers in our picture for the full year I think should give people some confidence on that. I mean, if you step back from the big picture, we've got a very positive situation. We have -- the total industry, they were predicting the down 2.5%, which is at the better end of the range that we've seen long-term for total tobacco industry, ex-U.S. and China.","Our volume, we're predicting to come in between 1 and 1.5, meaning we're gaining share, pricing at about 6%. So there's a nice healthy mix between the two. Revenues, we're seeing at least 6% ex-currency adjusted. We're seeing good growth on RRPs and HTUs, particularly coming from markets with high margins like the EU and managing our costs and investments. So you see the margin expanding 150 basis points we're estimating for the full year. And then you see our EPS guidance at least 9% despite the non-controlling interest issue, and so forth.","So I think that's a pretty good indication of a very well shaped P&L and a good overall positive business momentum. So I hope people take that as the true picture of a situation, and realize that there was no merit to the idea that the discussion with Altria had anything to do with our base business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Rampton of UBS.","Robert Rampton","Three questions for me, if I may. The first is on Japan. I'm interested to know what the cap rate, in particular versus 2Q. I mean, I can see that your share has improved and you've had competitive launches over the same period and there are more coming. So some color on the overall category will be great.","Martin King","Okay, do you want to take one at a time, or\u2026?","Robert Rampton","Yes, that would be great.","Martin King","So overall heat-not-burn category for Japan continues to grow. From the end of last year till now, it's up about 2 percentage points. We're at about 25% for the total category. We've gained most of that. So we're maintaining, in fact, improving a little bit our segments share. But sequentially, it's not quite so smooth. There was a bigger step up in Q1. It continues to grow. But I think if you look at it more from the beginning of the year, you can see the overall picture with of course, as you mentioned, additional product launches coming from various other competitors.","So we're gratified by the category growth and our ability to grow within the category is intact as well. Our segments share is solid and you see that from our exit shares from C-stores at over 18% for this quarter. So I think we're on a on a steady trend of Japan continuing to grow. It's not as fast as, say our Russia, which is growing spectacularly right now. But its good solid growth given the total size of the category and our share, are already very substantial in Japan.","And we're also gratified by the DUO. I think the launcher DUO can be underestimated. This product is very positive from the point of view of consumer experience. Those that have been using it, we're surprised at how much of a difference it made, being that you have the tubes experience as anytime you want and the very fast charging time to come back to the first experience. It just makes it seamless. And you don't have to worry about the charging, or waiting, or the device. It's really a very nice step forward as far as the overall consumer experience.","So we have high hopes for DUO, particularly in Japan and Korea, where we will focus the first of volumes as we ramp up production.","Robert Rampton","On East Asia and Australia Asia more broadly, so per pack revenue for the region declined a lot kind of sequentially and year-on-year. Trying to understand what's driven that? You flagged some price right downs and inventory right downs, you have -- it\u2019s been kind of there and specifically what the run rate is in that market?","Martin King","Well, we did have some device price adjustments in the quarter. In Japan, we used to have a pricing ladder. There was more or less \u00a51,198,000 for three multi and 2.4 plus. Now in Japan, 2.4 Plus is almost gone very, few people buy it. It's doing very well in other markets. But in Japan, we now have DUO coming in at 10,000 essentially and then multi three and multi fill out the pricing ladder down from there.","And one of the consequences of reducing the pricing for the existing inventories of three and multi and a little bit of 2.4 Plus is yes, we did have to revalue the inventories in Japan. So you see that one time effect hitting the quarter. So it's probably disproportionate to what's really happening with pricing, because you're taking an inventory and revaluing it as opposed to just having the effect of the sales that you actually made in the quarter. Does that make sense?","Robert Rampton","It does, yes. And can you just give us -- if you could quantify that number?","Martin King","No, I mean I think you see it in the pricing line and in that line there if you can try to pick out the effect. So we haven't given individual inventory revaluation type numbers.","Robert Rampton","And my last question. Just can we get a color market share in the UK and specifically London? I mean, just anecdotally. I've seen a lot of it around and obviously, the market where e-cigarette use is very high and we've also cut prices. So I'm curious to hear how IQOS is doing in this market?","Martin King","Yes, IQOS is doing better in London and the UK, admittedly from a relatively small base.","But it's up itself over 1% in London, depending on how you define the city, right? But it's doing much better. It's grown at a much faster rate in the last few months than it was before. And we're encouraged by the pickup that we're seeing in the UK and in London, in particular. Now it's from a small base and we have obviously many other markets where the share is much higher. But it's very good to see it moving and we anticipate better results coming forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","I have a follow up question on your discussions with Altria. Were there any changes to your agreement with Altria on IQOS that emerged from the merger discussions that more closely align each of your interests? And is there sufficient incentive for Altria to invest behind and push the product?","Martin King","Yes. I mean, I think one of the benefits of the merger discussions and going through all the discussions about how we would align et cetera, is that we came out of this period with better understanding of each other and better alignment, both regulatory and how we would go about IQOS et cetera. The current agreement is the one we had before that we're continuing to commercialize under. But I think we did come out of this whole thing with better alignment, better understanding better push for IQOS in the U.S.","And I think given the news flow around the e-vapor and everything else, I think we both agree that there is even more of an opportunity for IQOS in the U.S. than we might have understood a few months ago. And if there were any doubts about Altria's alignment and interest behind IQOS, I think it's very clear they are fully focused on it. They were before but even more so perhaps now that IQOS has even bigger opportunity in the U.S., given the news flow and the whole situation around e-vapor.","Now, I mean, we haven't disclose the terms of the agreement. But Altria has very good incentives to make sure that IQOS does very well. And we're very happy with the arrangement, the agreement, their execution in Atlanta, so far has been excellent. And we look forward to some good success coming out of that.","Pamela Kaufman","And just related to that. Are you seeing any impact from the healthcare around vaping in the U.S. on consumer attitudes towards our view outside of the U.S, given the potential for this issue creates confusion among consumers? Do you want to see any impact on IQOS's performance?","Martin King","We don't. Although, we are working hard to make sure that IQOS is distinguished from the issues in the U.S.; making sure it's understood that this is not an e-cigarette, this is a heated tobacco product; making sure it's understood our track record. We have 12 million plus users now. We have very good conversion practices to make sure that we're focused on adult smokers. We have lots of experience in over 50 markets, with making sure that the people that convert to IQOS are former adult smokers. We also emphasize that this is scientifically substantiated product. We've got the FDA authorization. So we're able to really make sure that the IQOS heat-not-burn is in a different category.","At the same time, when we're engaging with regulators and others, we're very clear to say that the issues that they're hearing about in the U.S. are not coming from authentic properly manufactured close system e-cigarettes. In other words, it would be unfortunate for a properly manufactured, properly regulated e-cigarette to be caught up in this issue around the unfortunate illnesses and very unfortunate deaths that have been reported in the U.S. We understand that is a different issue from a properly done e-cigarette, like we will have or do have already, but we'll have better versions of with our MESH.","And so we have worked hard to both make sure that it's understood what e-cigarettes are and how they can be properly regulated to make sure these issues don't evolve. But also to make sure that they understand the heat-not-burn and IQOS are truly a different category and shouldn't be even in the discussion around the issues they're hearing about from the U.S. I mean when it comes to the youth access issue, this is where we focus on our good conversion practices and are very stringent focus on adult smokers.","Pamela Kaufman","And should we expect you to file any PMTA applications next year, maybe related to IQOS MESH?","Martin King","With regard to IQOS MESH, as you know we have the improved device. We are working very hard to ramp up our production. We are on track to be able to launch in a market this year. And we are very much focused on expanding production and capacity so that we can satisfy a number of international markets next year. So our full focus with MESH is in international markets. Obviously, we're focused in the U.S. on IQOS heat-not-burn and the agreement with Altria.","Now, with regard to MESH, we are putting together a package of scientific substantiation, which we could use in the future with a number of different regulators and that work needs to happen regardless. So that's our plan for MESH is to get it into as many markets internationally as we can. At the end of this year starting, but really next year is the big ramp up.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","I want to ask you sort of more general question, because this is not I didn't understand about these results. The first thing was that the margin was substantially better than certainly I was expecting. Are the two key results you said you'd be investing much more heavily in the first quarter but that you said that didn't seem to come through, and I was just wondering why? You also said that part of the reason for the good margin growth was that you've actually done very well in high margin markets for RRP, specifically the EU. And yet at the same time, the market share growth in the EU, as you said yourself, was a little bit disappointing. So I'm wanting if you can sort of bring all those things together. Why was the margin so strong? When frankly, you said it probably wouldn't be in 3Q. And if you can give a little bit more color about what you sort of think the underlying market share for such a thing in the EU is for IQOS? Thank you. That would be the first question.","Martin King","First of all, with regard to why the margin was better, it's two things. One is additional pricing, which we called it out for Philippines, Turkey, as two examples. The other piece is costs were lower into third quarter shifting to the fourth quarter. You're right, the $170 million for RRP related investment compares to the $200 million that we have said and planned. But there are also some additional costs throughout various areas of the company that shifted.","The total impact is probably about $30 million for the RRPs and about $40 million or $50 million for all the other costs netted together. So when you move that from one quarter to the other, it has a pretty significant impact. And I would emphasize, this isn't spending lower spending, primarily it's just movement from one quarter to the next, hence the fourth quarter impact.","Now as far as talking about when we called out the EU impact of higher margin volume coming from HTUs that was more of a total year picture when we were explaining the device wait in the margin, I mean, in the RRP revenues being around 15% to help folks with their modeling and so forth. Now for EU, growth during the quarter, you're right. Sequentially, the share growth was about 0.1, which was not as much as you might expect, especially since the end market sales we're up 9%.","So you have a seasonality impact where cigarette volume sales are higher in the summer. And that obscured the fact that HTUs were actually up very nicely at 9%. And if you look at the year-over-year, the share was up more than doubled from 1.2 to 2.5. So the EU growth rate is continuing at a very nice cliff. It's obscured a bit just when you look sequentially in the quarter. And we always said share, in particular, tends to be a little bit lumpy.","When we look at user acquisition, we look at in market sales, those are more direct leading indicators of where it's going. And the momentum in the EU is very solid, very good. And that will eventually of course lead to continued improvement in margin as the volumes in the EU are already very significant by the way. If you look at the number of units shipped but they're growing at a very nice pace. And of course, they're coming with substantially higher margins than the average elsewhere.","Adam Spielman","I mean, certainly, the 40 or 50 movements in 4Q does I mean this is very minor and perhaps I shouldn't waste your time even asking it. A quick follow up questions is it's in my look. I mean why seasonality affects cigarettes more than the HTUs in the EU, it appears to me? But there's -- the more important point is if you can try and give some color about Russia, because in Russia things are clearly going well. But again, it seems very volatile. You had I thought excellent growth sequentially in Q1 and it went backwards in Q2 than even more surprising, but very sharp growth sequentially in Q3. How should we think about the passing of this? And how, I guess -- also congratulate EU. I mean, should we think or if you're modeling this. Should we just assume, I don't know 20 or 30 bps of market share expansion a quarter, I don't average it will have work out and equally in Russia. How should we think about it given the volatility in market shares you're reporting?","Martin King","So first just quickly the seasonality topic, because it does also affect Russia. What we're seeing is that heated tobacco units' seasonality is different from combustible cigarettes. And one of the reasons is because people are more likely to use it indoors. So the cigarette consumption in Europe, for example, increases as people have more time outdoors during the summer months. But for HTUs, it doesn't seem to move as much, because people can use it more into their houses et cetera without bothering others. And so they feel much less constrained about their cigarette -- their consumption of HTUs depending on how the weather is.","And this also partly is your answer on Russia. If you remember in the first quarter, we called out that the share for HTUs in Russia was flattered by the fact that the consumption of cigarettes was much lower during the super cold weather. And that's because you don't want to go outside to use one. And so it's on the other way in a slightly different quarter in Russia, and help to explain some of that difference in share. And we topped down the share in Russia in first quarter, and we were right. It came back in and showed exactly where we were in the second quarter.","And here you have the opposite effect going on in the EU, because of the warm summer months' seasonality impact. And we saw that also, by the way, in Korea and elsewhere that these seasonality impacts are part of explaining the reason why the share tends to come a bit lumpy. Again, we have underlying view on how fast we're acquiring consumers, and that's really our focus and our biggest forward looking number. We've been giving that number on an aggregate basis, and you see it and the step up this quarter to over 12 million. And casing we've given it broken to regions, but that's probably our best way of having a look forward on what's coming this year.","Adam Spielman","And you can't give us a year of sort of underline -- so in Japan, you sort of talked about underlying market share was essentially flat. You can't talk about something like that in the EU, or in Russia but it's just somehow an adjusted figure, but try to exclude some of the volatility practice?","Martin King","I mean, we went down that path in Japan, because of the heightened concerns and because of the issues we'd had about shares and being impacted by competitor inventories and so forth. I mean, I hesitate to get into that sort of reporting everywhere in the world. We've done it sort of on a temporary basis to try to give people more transparency on the Japan situation, given where we were last year. But I don't think we need to go into that with EU.","We're growing very nicely. We're delivering the results. We see this strong year-over-year. There's no slowdown in momentum in the EU. So I think we will stick with what we got. And eventually even in Japan and other places, we may stop doing that extra transparency once it's no longer needed.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","So I wanted to touch on IQOS in the U.S. please. In looking at the introductory bundle that's being sold, it seems like it's a very attractive proposition for the consumer at $80 for carton of consumables plus advice. Would you be able to comment at all on who is funding that promo? Because it seems like the implied price of the device is $25, which is far lower than what I've seen even on a promoted basis in international markets.","Martin King","Yes, I think I'm going to leave those sorts of questions to Altria who is commercializing IQOS in the U.S. The answer is funding it. I mean, they are responsible for the commercial expenditures around the launch. And so the answer would be, it would be their program and their funding, and their decision on how to approach the consumer in the U.S.","Obviously, we've shared with them and continue to share with them all of our experiences from around the world, and what we've seen in the many markets we've launched in. But it's their program and their decision on it. And I think I'll leave it to them to answer those specific questions like that.","Vivien Azer","And then my second question also on IQOS in the U.S., I can certainly appreciate the optimism that you're expressing on the call today, in particular in light of growing concerns around potential health effects with liquid e-vapor, but as I reflect back on some of the pre marketing consumer work that you guys did in the U.S. relative to some of the other countries where you were running similar consumer trials. If I recall correctly, U.S. trial and conversion looks closer to Italy, or Switzerland than it did, even in Germany but certainly not a Japan, or South Korea. But if you could just remind us why you have so much confidence? Because yes, like Italy certainly, at this point in a 4.6% share, is clearly a success story, but it was five years in the making. Thanks.","Martin King","I think we've said in the past that if you look at consumer readiness for reduced risk products and the openness to switching out of smoking that we see a lot of receptivity. We said in the U.S. the ability to communicate with consumers is actually very good. There are rules around how we need to report and do it with the FDA, given the pre market authorization. But compared to other countries around the world, the ability to communicate with consumers is very good.","Now, as far as any studies you might be referring to, Vivien, I would imagine they're very old by now, if you're talking about studies done back when we were looking at Italy and Japan. They would be about five years old, or more by now. And you have a tremendous fee change in the U.S. with regard to people's receptivity to reduce risk products, understanding of the issues around smoking, et cetera. So ","So we have high confidence that the U.S. will perform well.","And we've always said it's probably somewhere in between where the EU has taken time and energy, because of the consumer receptiveness and the ability to communicate. And it probably won't be as quick as say Japan or Korea started out, where they were -- it was a phenomenon and it kind of took off on us. So we'll see, right, it's early days. But we have heightened expectations given the news flow that's happening to U.S., if you're a smoker and considering alternatives.","And this is the only product with PMTA authorization in the heated tobacco space, and it's got your taste and performance very, very well. I mean, I think it's got to be very high consideration, maybe even higher than it would have been a couple of months ago. So I think that's where we are on the U.S. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","So on the CapEx decline of $100 million for this year. Is it because it shifted to us by '20, or there is a change to growth expectations?","Martin King","Neither. We've sharpened our pencils. We are better and better at getting more capacity out of the existing assets, particularly when it comes to production of heated tobacco units. Our uptimes keep improving. Our waste rates keep declining. Our ability of our factories to produce efficiently continues to improve beyond our initial expectations. And so we've been able to scale back some of the investments.","And usually at the beginning of the year, we put our capacity plans down as best we can. But there is a probably a little bit of opportunities to sharpen the pencil and cleanup the estimates, and come to a closer number and we're near the end of the year now. So we've been able to revise and refine our numbers and come to the billion. But it's not shifting to next year nor is it an indication of not needing the capacity. If anything, our capacity is in line with our $90 billion to $100 billion estimate that we have for -- by 2021. We're well on track to hit that and that's the capacity number we're focused on for heated tobacco units, as well as of course preparing for MESH and the e-cigarette platform for ramp up that I mentioned earlier.","Gaurav Jain","Now coming to the new product categories, so there is a lot of discussion around modern oral. Do you have any plans in that category?","Martin King","Around which category?","Gaurav Jain","Around the modern oral category? ","Martin King","I mean we continue to monitor. We look at it very closely. But yes, right now, we don't have a modern oral product on the market. But we certainly have studied it and looked at it. And most of our markets right now today, we don't have huge oral category. But we are interested in that product, because it is reduced risk product category and we think it may play a role in the future.","Gaurav Jain","And my last question is just on the stock price, so you know your stock is where it was in 2011. Can you do something to change the trajectory? Like launch a share buyback, such as Progressive. Now that your balance sheet is more under control, you're not planning M&A. There doesn't seem to be any obvious escalation for you out there.","Martin King","Well, with regard to stock buybacks. We've said that our focus in the interim time next 18 months or so is to get into the leverage ratios that go with our mid-single A credit rating, and we are committed to that. And you see us slowly deleveraging over the last period, and we'll continue to do that. Once we get into the range for the mid-single A, then the board would be able to reconsider starting stock buybacks. I'd share with you that perhaps the underlying feeling that our stock is a good buy, but we aren't ready yet to be able to -- to start a buyback program until we get our leverage ratios to the range as it goes with our mid-single A rating.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question [Operator instructions]. Our final question will come from the one line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","Just one question for me then, so on the earnings guidance you called out the higher growth in market to sizable non-controlling interest. I was just hoping you could provide a bit more specifics here in terms of which markets they are, what sort of growth you're actually seeing in operating income and also what is driving the strong growth? Thank you.","Martin King","The one we called out and it's probably the best explanation for this, is Philippines with 50% non-controlling interest in the Philippines. And we haven't given the specific market profitability. But you can see from the pricing and from the fact that our Marlboro share, for example, is way up as we get up trading. Marlboro has now hit 40% share this quarter. So you can see in the Philippines, I think, or you can sense in the Philippines that the profitability is up substantially. Obviously, we share that with our partners with 50%.","So when your overall growth in the operating income line is being boosted by an affiliate like the Philippines and then half of it goes to the non-controlling interest, when you go to the EPS, that growth there is not obviously as pronounced. Turkey is another example where there is a non-controlling interest. And there are others, I'm not going to go through the whole list. But you can see, I believe in the P&L, you see the non-controlling interest line and you see this been growing.","And it's pretty substantial on third quarter and we expect it to take another significant step up in the fourth quarter as the full impact of the pricing in countries like and affiliates like Philippines and Turkey kick in since their pricing only started partway through the second quarter, I mean, the third quarter. In the case of the Philippines, it was the end of August. In the case of Turkey, it was in August as well. So the fourth quarter will see another step up in non-controlling interest.","Operator","And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","A - Martin King","Yes, I mean, I think I just like to close with the thought that our overall year is showing very good momentum. We pointed a little bit to the fourth quarter, and that we expect the currency neutral growth of net revenues and adjusted operating income to be in line with our year-to-date. However, the impact of the non-controlling interest and the tax rate differential leads us to about a 9% drag at the EPS line."," Nevertheless, I think if you stand back and look at the big picture, we have a very positive year with good momentum going forward with nice balance between volume, share, pricing, margin expansion and the growth of heated tobacco units, especially coming from some higher margin locations like EU. We're seeing broad geographic success of heated tobacco units, and our smoke free future strategy is paying off throughout the results of the company as well.","So I think that would close it. And thank you all very much for listening.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude Philip Morris International's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas M. Rolli - VP-Investor Relations & Financial Communications","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 fourth quarter and full-year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations App.","During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2015 and comparing them to the same period in 2014, unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, adjustments and other calculations as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Reduced-risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking cigarettes.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer period. Andr\u00e9.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. 2015 was an excellent year for PMI. Moderating declines in cigarette industry volume, notably in the EU region, coupled with market share gains, enabled us to record a full-year organic cigarette shipment volume decline of only 1%, our best performance since 2012. Of particular note were the performances of Marlboro and L&M, which grew cigarette volume by 0.9% and 3.9% respectively.","Strong pricing across all regions combined with substantially lower and favorable volume\/mix compared to recent years resulted in net revenue and adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 5.8% and 6.6% respectively.","Despite significant incremental investments behind both iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio announced last July and disclosed in today's press release, our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.3 percentage points to 42.6%, excluding currency and acquisitions. The increase was driven by the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by a very strong 12%, at the high end of the raised guidance range that we reaffirmed last November.","The strengthening of the U.S. dollar against virtually all of our key operating currencies was an unprecedented headwind for our business in 2015 and resulted in a full-year adverse currency impact of $1.20 on our adjusted diluted EPS.","In the fourth quarter, our organic cigarette volume declined by 2.4% due to lower cigarette industry volumes and lower market share, notably in the Asia region. Our cigarette volume was impacted by a one-time distributor inventory adjustment in Russia related to supply chain optimization. Excluding this adjustment, our quarterly volume decline was in line with that of the full year.","Net revenues increased by 4%, excluding currency, with favorable pricing across all regions, more than offsetting unfavorable volume\/mix, mainly the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. As previously communicated, our incremental investments in 2015 were concentrated in the fourth quarter. This resulted in currency-neutral adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS declines in the quarter.","Our full-year 2015 results confirm that our business fundamentals are strong, and the incremental investments that we made throughout the year and in the fourth quarter in particular should further reinforce our momentum in 2016.","Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2016 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.25 to $4.35. This was $4.42 in 2015 and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.60. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency of approximately 10% to 12% compared to an adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015. This reflects a currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth rate above our mid- to long-term algorithm. Importantly, this guidance does not include any share repurchases. We'll revisit the potential for repurchases as the year unfolds depending on the currency environment.","The $0.60 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates included in our 2016 guidance, is driven primarily by the Argentine peso, Indonesia rupiah, Japanese yen and Russian ruble. These four currencies account for around 60% of the total impact. We have currently hedged approximately 72% of our 2016 forecast sales to Japan which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of 118 yen to the U.S. dollar versus 110 yen in 2015.","Pricing was the key driver of our full-year 2015 financial performance. We recorded a total pricing variance of $2.1 billion, supported by strong contributions from all four regions. As a reminder, this variance includes an exceptional gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the January 2015 excise tax increase, which will not recur in 2016. This year, we anticipate a pricing variance of around 6% of our 2015 net revenues.","Our performance in 2015 was underpinned by an improving cigarette industry volume trend and continued market share momentum. We estimate that international cigarette industry volume, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 2.4% in 2015, a further moderation compared to the declines in 2015 and 2014. For this year, we forecast a decline of 2% to 2.5% on the same basis.","Our continued market share momentum in 2015 is clearly demonstrated on this slide, with international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 0.2 points to 28.7%, and share growth in the EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions. Our share in the Asia region was stable.","Marlboro was a key driver of market share momentum in 2015, increasing its international share, excluding China and the U.S., by 0.2 points to 9.6%. The brand had growing or stable share in all four regions and continued to benefit from the roll-out of Architecture 2.0, which is now approaching 100 markets worldwide. Importantly, our 2015 share in the top-30 PMI OCI markets grew by 0.7 points to 38%, with share up or essentially flat in 20 of these markets. This underscores the positive momentum of our business across the majority of our most profitable markets.","While pricing and market share gains are the foundation of our top line growth, we remain focused on effectively managing our cost base. Our midterm targeted annual cost base increase is 1% to 3%, excluding RRPs and currency.","In 2015, we decided to deploy additional investments, some of which will not recur in 2016, to support the strong momentum of our cigarette brand portfolio and accelerate the geographic expansion of iQOS. This resulted in a total cost base increase, excluding currency, of 3.6% excluding RRPs or 5.3% including RRPs. In 2016, we expect our total cost base, including RRPs, to increase by approximately 1%, excluding currency, reflecting productivity and cost-saving programs and also held by the moderating prices for key inputs such as tobacco leaf, clove and non-tobacco materials.","Let me now discuss our performance in key geographies, beginning the EU region. Following declines of 7.3% and 3.1% in 2013 and 2014 respectively, there was a further moderation of the total cigarette industry volume decline to 0.9% in 2015. We attribute the moderation to improving economies, notably Southern Europe, a decline in the prevalence of illicit trade, less outreaching to the fine-cut category and a lower prevalence of e-vapor product.","Our positive cigarette share momentum in the region continued in 2015, with fourth quarter and full-year share up by 0.3 points and 0.1 point respectively. In the fourth quarter, our share increased in five of the six largest markets by cigarette industry volume, demonstrating the breadth of our share strength. As we had anticipated, our share in Italy was adversely impacted by the decline of Marlboro, following its crossing of five euro per-pack price point in the first quarter of 2015.","Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield further reinforced their positions as the region's top-three cigarette industry brands by volume for the second consecutive year. Full-year market share for Marlboro increased by 0.2 points to 18.9%, driven by strong performances in France, Germany and Spain. Share for L&M increased by 0.1 point by 6.9%, while Chesterfield grew by 0.2 share points to 5.8%.","The moderating cigarette industry volume decline, coupled with our market share gains and strong pricing, resulted in adjusted OCI growth excluding currency and acquisitions of 4.6% in the EU region in 2015. This marked the region's first adjusted OCI increase on the same basis since 2009. In 2016, we forecast mid-single digit currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the region.","I will now turn to Russia, the largest market in our EEMA region, where estimated cigarette industry volume declined by 8.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year. The declines were mainly due to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which we estimate averaged more than 20% year-over-year, as well as lower consumer purchasing power.","Our full-year 2015 market share increased by 0.9 points to 28.4%, driven mainly by low-price Bond Street and super-low price Next, which benefited from adult smoker down-trading and a wider distribution, particularly in the eastern part of the country. Importantly, Parliament was up by 0.2 share points, despite the overall premium segment decline of 0.7 points.","In January this year, the government implemented its planned 2016 excise tax increase, resulting in an average tax pass-on of around 10 rubles per pack or 14% on an industry weighted average basis. In anticipation, we announced retail selling price increases across the majority of our portfolio of five rubles per pack last November and a further five rubles per pack this January, with the most recent increase likely to appear at retail in the second quarter.","Estimated cigarette industry volume in Turkey grew by 7.8% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the full year. This exceptional growth was driven mainly by a significant reduction in the prevalence of illicit trade, which declined by over five percentage points to around 14% in 2015. Our market share in Turkey has strengthened, with three quarters of sequential growth. Fourth quarter share increased by 0.3 points to 44.2% and was driven by the superb performance of Marlboro, up by 1.2 points to 9.9%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 20.6% in the quarter.","In January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum excise tax, while leaving the ad valorem rate unchanged, representing a further improvement in the excise tax structure. This resulted in a pass-on of around 40 kurus per pack at the retail level. We implemented a retail selling price increase of one lira per pack across the majority of our portfolio, thus enhancing unit margin.","I will now touch on our Asia region, beginning with Indonesia, where estimated cigarette industry volume was stable in 2015, in line with our forecast and primarily due to the soft economy. While market share in the fourth quarter declined by one point to 34.3%, reflecting the impact of retail price increases on our machine-made kretek brands taken in advance of the January 2016 excise tax increase, our full-year market share grew slightly to 35%. On an industry weighted average basis, the 2016 excise tax increase is around 15%.","Despite the muted performance of the total market last year, we remain very optimistic about the profit growth opportunities in this key market, thanks to its growing adult population and rising income levels.","In the Philippines, price gaps narrowed further in the fourth quarter, following price increases at the bottom of the market. The gap between Marlboro and the super-low price brands of our primary local competitor now stands at around one peso per cigarette, and narrowing of 50 centavos per cigarette or 33% since December 2013.","The improved price gaps have been a key driver of our strong share performance. Based on Nielsen retail audit data, our full-year 2015 share increased by 1.4 points to 73.4%. Marlboro was the primary driver of this share gain, increasing by an impressive 2.7 points to 21.4%. Fortune also gained share, growing by 0.7 points to 31.1%. Marlboro shipment volume increased by 18.8% in 2015 and drove favorable mix. Encouragingly, we continue to improve profitability in this important market.","In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 2.1% in 2015. This was less than what we had anticipated, due mainly to trade inventory build-up from competitors' recent new launches. Our cigarette market share performance was clearly below our expectations. Share declined by 0.6 points to 25.3% in 2015, due primarily to competitors' offerings in the new differentiated menthol taste segment. Nevertheless, we remain confident in the long-term outlook for our cigarette brand portfolio in Japan.","Turning to our reduced-risk products portfolio, let me briefly highlight the progress that we made in 2015 on the commercialization of iQOS. During the year, we expanded the geographic presence of iQOS in our 2014 city launch markets, with the first wave of expansion in Japan reaching over 60% of the adult smoker population and the initial expansion in Italy beyond Milan to Modena, Rome and Turin. We also launched iQOS in major cities across Switzerland and commenced city launches in Bucharest, Lisbon and Moscow. By the end of 2016, we expect iQOS to be present in key cities in around 20 markets globally.","In Japan, which is by far our more advanced iQOS launch market in terms of geographic and adult smoker coverage, we estimate there were over 130,000 fully or predominantly converted iQOS users by the end of 2015. In the last week of December, we achieved an estimated off-take share for Marlboro HeatSticks of 1.1% in the expansion area and 1.7% in Tokyo. Importantly, our weekly off-take shares have grown steadily since the expansion began in September. Please note that off-take share represents retail sales volume for HeatSticks as a percentage of the total estimated retail sales volume for cigarettes and HeatSticks within a given geographic area.","I look forward to sharing further the scientific and commercial that we have made with iQOS during our presentation at the CAGNY Conference later this month.","I will now cover our free cash flow, which increased by over $300 million in 2015 to reach $6.9 billion. This was a remarkable achievement, considering the adverse currency impact of $1.9 billion on our net earnings and was fueled by important working capital initiatives. As a reminder, the proceeds from the Sampoerna Rights Issue are not included in our free cash flow.","In 2016, we forecast free cash flow broadly in line with last year's level, again, despite the anticipated adverse currency headwind at prevailing exchange rates.","We remain focused on rewarding our shareholders generously, with the dividend currently serving as the primary use of our free cash flow. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the eighth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 122% at a compound annual growth rate of 12%. Our dividend yield at the end of last week was 4.5%. This is very attractive in comparison to the yields of our peer group company.","In conclusion, 2015 was an excellent year for PMI, reflecting improved cigarette industry volume trends and very robust business fundamentals. Our superior cigarette brand portfolio, supported by a unique commercial organization, is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Marlboro is performing extremely well, with the continued roll-out of the 2.0 Architecture driving volume and share growth.","We're very excited by our progress with the commercialization of iQOS, which is underscored by our favorable HeatStick off-take share momentum in Japan. Our strong free cash flow continues to support our generous dividends. Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. On a currency-neutral basis, our 2016 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% versus 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42.","Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operation Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","I just had two questions about pricing. I guess first, Andr\u00e9, I wanted to ask you about the pricing environment in Japan, since Japan Tobacco has requested a price increase on Mevius. I was wondering whether you've made any similar requests on your portfolio or if you can talk us through how you're thinking about the opportunity there.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Clearly, the move from Japan Tobacco is encouraging, but you appreciate I cannot make any further comments on pricing in Japan, for obvious reasons.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. But that, I guess, would confirm that you haven't made any formal requests yet.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I didn't say that.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Regardless of what your intentions might be. Okay. And then, I guess just a broader question then. Your comments about the expectation for a 6% pricing variance this year implies about $1.6 billion in pricing, a bit below the $1.8 billion that we would typically think of as being sort of a midterm target. And I know that Korea accounts for a portion of that gap. But if we exclude that, is there more an issue of rounding, or do you see the potential for a more moderate level of pricing across the industry this year in light of macroeconomic weakness?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well as you rightly said, Korea is the biggest swing because it swings about almost 1 point of pricing variance year-to-year compared to our previous year's revenues. Apart that, there is nothing particular here that we should be reading, so we're very confident about the pricing environment. I think it's very positive and the excise tax environment is also positive, so not much change compared to the previous year.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I guess one other quick follow-up. Just within Indonesia, you mentioned the impact of crossing some critical pricing thresholds during the fourth quarter. Is that a temporary price gap issue or something that could linger for a few quarters?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think this is temporary because sooner or later, others are crossing the critical points. Now, that had more impact for us in this quarter. There is another phenomenon that had a lot of increased activity, I would say, towards the end of the year in Indonesia, which is a number of competitive offerings that sell essentially 20 sticks per pack at the price of 16. Now, these propositions typically are not viable longer term because if you remember, the excise tax in Indonesia is specific and on a per-stick basis. But temporarily, you have some distortions because of these launches that should ease during the year. So that's essentially what happened in Indonesia in the quarter.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks and congratulations on the results this year.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for your question.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Andr\u00e9, I wanted to get a little bit more color on the Russian market. Obviously, the shipment number in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by inventory movement. But I think your share also was a little bit softer sequentially. So just wondering what's going on competitively. What are you seeing in terms of down-trading situation in terms of the consumers? And then if you look out for 2016, your view in terms of how the industry volume would look like in Russia.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. First of all, let's start with this inventory that has a little bit distorted the numbers of the fourth quarter overall, so for PMI. Essentially, it's an one-off adjustment because we decided to have our own warehouses in certain parts of the country rather than our distributor in order to facilitate distribution. And on top of it, it helps working capital. So that's the reason we implemented, but there is no swings in there. That's one-off.","In terms of what's happening in the market, in terms of total market, you appreciate it's a bit difficult to forecast. Last year, we had forecasted the total market will decline by 9%. We ended up much better. We forecast again, given the magnitude of the price increases, another 9% this year. If we come out better, we'll all be very happy. That's how I see the market.","Now, in terms of downtrading, clearly there is downtrading. It's not dramatic. But we see if we look at the year, 2% share shifting from the mid segment and premium segment to essentially the low-price segment, not the super-low, which is fairly stable. And we gain share in both premium, low and super-low segment. So I think we're well positioned overall in this environment.","Now again, Russia, you know the economy's a bit weak. The ruble has devalued. But overall, I think in terms of portfolio position, we are in a very good place and we've already taking pricing. So I feel pretty good about Russia overall, if the ruble was a bit less volatile than it is. Have I answered your questions?","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. That's helpful. And then I guess my second question is just in terms of the investments that you made in 2015 and I guess more specifically lapping of that in 2016. Because your comment that your cost base is still going up 1% year-over-year implies that the incremental investment's actually staying in the cost base in 2016 and so forth. So are these investments that you've made in 2015 still continuing as it relates to some of these iQOS commercialization? Or can you just give us a little bit sense of kind of that lapping of that and costs still going up on a year-over-year basis?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. What happened is, first of all, the direction we gave for 2016 is 1% approximately up, including reduced-risk products, where we have obviously incremental spending compared to 2015. Okay, that's the first item. And don't forget, our target is 1% to 3% per year, excluding RRP.","So just to facilitate your understanding, I would say that 40% of the incremental spending in the last quarter is nonrecurring in 2016, roughly, okay? And we clearly had also quite substantial incremental spending on iQOS in the fourth quarter. Now, the nonrecurring items relate to obviously the implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive in 2016, but some of the costs have to happen in 2015. It's also some restructuring that we don't report under reported, but in the normal earnings, plus some one-off items. So in total, that's what \u2013 how I would see it. And I hope I helped you a little bit to understand.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, I guess what you're saying is that 60% of the incremental spending is still recurring so you have that still in 2016. And then obviously, the 1% total cost base going up also still includes some of the commercialization spending related to iQOS that would be more incremental in nature.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Understood. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Bushnell of Exane.","James Bushnell - Exane Ltd.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first was on pricing in Europe. Obviously, you've had a good year there, and the outlook looks good in terms of OCI growth. But the pricing numbers seem to be a little softer than earlier in the year, and I just wondered if you could give us some color around that, please. And then the second question was on the retention rates you're getting in iQOS. The market share numbers you mentioned sound quite impressive, but I just wondered if the 30% retention rates you mentioned in the past was still consistent and how it was looking in Switzerland, for example, as well. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. In Europe; pricing in Europe is unchanged. What we make some difference in the quarter is, if you remember, in Germany in 2014, we took pricing in the middle of the year toward the second half. And in 2015, we anticipated earlier. So until the third quarter, we had two overlapping annualization of pricing from the previous year, from 2014, and the pricing in 2015, which we don't have \u2013 we didn't have in the last quarter. But as you know, we announced pricing in Germany, so we are back in the normal course. Okay. That will explain this. Now, I will give much more granularity about iQOS in CAGNY. I don't want to steal the thunders of everybody, but the retention rates are much higher than the 30%. And that's very encouraging in Japan, actually.","James Bushnell - Exane Ltd.","Great. Okay. Well, look forward to CAGNY. Thanks a lot for your answer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Andr\u00e9 and Jacek.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Bonnie.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","Hi.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","My first question is on the EU. How sustainable are the improved trends you've been seeing throughout the region? And also, you continue to highlight a lower prevalence of e-vapor products in the EU. So I'm curious how much of a factor that's been to the improved combustible cig volume; possibly these consumers have been switching back.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, I hope the trends in Europe are sustainable. I mean where we forecast, it's early in the year. But from everything we know, including pricing, we think we may be a bit lower than last year, a bit higher decline but well above actually our 2% to 3% secular decline that we anticipate. So to me it looks fairly good in Europe, okay? And part of that is attributed, obviously, to a lower share of e-cigarettes but also a little bit less illicit trade. And I think maybe because the economies also are improving, higher average daily consumption, which you don't see in the trends. But that explains part of the volume, clearly.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then I have a question on your share repurchase program. So if your FX headwind stays where it's at, say, for the next couple of quarters, is this an okay level for you to resume your share repurchases? Or do you need this headwind to reverse to be comfortable before you'd resume your buyback? I'm just trying to get a sense of what's going to give you comfort? Is it more visibility or a lower headwind?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, a lower headwind, obviously, because at current levels, it makes no sense to resume share repurchases. So once we see reversal, then we can revisit the issue. And I hope we will see at some stage.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes. Agreed. If I may ask just one final quick question on your Marlboro 2.0 roll-out. Can you give us a sense of what percentage of your Marlboro 2.0 is rolled out? Is it complete, I guess? And is there typically a lag before you see the full impact of this on your overall Marlboro share?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think we're seeing the impact already.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And all the indications we have from the markets where we're already one or more years in the market is, all the fundamentals are improving; the perception is improving; the image is improving. So it has worked very well and actually beyond what I personally expected. So I don't know exactly weighted where we are. We're in 100 markets. I think it's 95% of the volume of Marlboro already or something like that. And everywhere, we've seen positive results. And if you remember, this is not just packaging. It's the whole communication of consumers, product improvement that were extremely well received by our consumers and also competitive smokers.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. So trends are increasing. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. I wanted to ask, first of all, in relation to volume, which did weaken a little bit sequentially in the fourth quarter \u2013 there are some unique factors that are leading to that \u2013 and if you look at the strong performance in the first nine months. As you look \u2013 as you move into 2016, you've indicated global volumes down about the same rate as they were last year. Are there any markets in particular where we should kind of keep a watch out here? I mean we've taken out the big ones so like Russia, Indonesia. Are those the ones you see being kind of the weakest here to lead out the year but improving throughout 2016?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I mean if we look overall, clearly, Russia, as I said, we have to make some assumptions. Last year, we're a bit positively surprised. I hope that's going to be the case, but we have to assume some decline in Russia. So we assumed, as I said, around 9% at this stage.","On the positive side, clearly, Korea, because last year we had quite impressive decline, about \u2013 apples-to-apples, I would say 20%, which this year hopefully, we're not going to see. And clearly, we see improving trends during the year. So that's on the positive side. We had a good upside in Turkey last year because of the illicit trade reduction plus increased consumption. I don't think we are going to see the same increment in Turkey this year, obviously. But as the year unfolds, we will know better.","In markets where we're less impacted, clearly, is India that had a big decline last year because of excise and VAT increases. But as you know, we have minimal exposure there and Brazil. And Brazil is likely to continue this year, obviously, because we had a combination of VAT tax increases in certain states because they have autonomy to decide about the VAT rates and also an excise tax increase that comes in two tranches in Brazil; one in May and one in December. So that's where I see it.","Now, Indonesia, again, is a bit early days. As you know on one side, we had a slightly soft economy. Price, the pass on of the excise tax in the previous year of about 5% of price increase equivalent. This year, it's 7.5%, not dramatic but slightly higher. And on the other side, we have \u2013 on the positive side we have minimum wage increases in the range of 11%. So how this is going to pay at the end of the year is very difficult to predict. Conservatively, we have assumed some decline, but we'll see if that materializes or not. And that's for the key markets. I don't know if I said that.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That was helpful. Thank you. I just had one quick follow-up, which is in relation to generally the global macro uncertainty, some of the risks we've seen in some of these key markets. And you have some pricing going up at a healthy rate, just due to excise tax pass-along. Are you seeing any changes in elasticity? Is it too early to tell for that? But I'm just curious if we're seeing kind of that weaker consumer reacting negatively to price increases in some of the key markets where you're taking those now.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, look, I must say that I'm positively surprised by elasticities rather than the opposite, actually. They come more on our side than I thought. So now, again, some of the emerging markets we have to watch as the economy weakens, but we don't see many \u2013 any signs \u2013 I'm sorry \u2013 of this occurring at this stage. So we'll keep you abreast of how this is going during the year. But I think we baked this in our forecast for total market for the year of to 2% to 2.5%.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's very encouraging. Have you said what percentage of your pricing you have in place already for the year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would say about 50%, slightly higher than that, at this stage.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for the time.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So my first question has to do with Latin America in terms of the cadence of the local currency profit growth. The profit growth had been quite robust for the first nine months of the year and it did decelerate. I was wondering if you could just \u2013 and on an easy comp So I was wondering if you could just expand on that a little bit, please.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry. I'm not sure...","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I'm showing that you had very strong double-digit profit growth in Latin America in the first nine months of the year that ended up resulting in full-year very robust local currency profit growth. But in the fourth quarter, your local currency profit growth was plus 1%, so it kind of \u2013 it's a big difference from what we have been seeing.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Profit, there is costs. It's more a question of costs rather than...","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","And Argentina.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And we had the Argentina devaluation as well. That was reflected in the last quarter. But in terms of pricing, there is no difference. We had regular price increases in Argentina. We're taking pricing in Mexico. But there is sometimes difference in timing of price increases, so that can explain some swings. I would not be reading these quarters with religiousness, I would say. Okay?","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","So the cost increase in Argentina is a one-time factor, or do we think \u2013 is that something that kind of persists for the next three quarters?","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","More of that \u2013 sorry \u2013 Jacek. It's more of the one factor. You should also look for the Latin comparing the Q4 of the last year, of 2014, because I think there was a different pattern of the shipment ahead of the tax price change in Mexico.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah.","Jacek Olczak - Chief Financial Officer","So this might swing around.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Understood. Thank you very much. My second question has to do with the EU and with plain packaging. You called out some investments in the UK, but you also called out negative mix shift. So I'm wondering if you could just expand on some of the changes that you're making in terms of your go to market as well as an update on the market landscape itself, if it's downtrading just in your portfolio, or are we already starting to see downtrading in the UK?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well first of all in the UK in particular, we've essentially taken back our distribution from Imperial. So in the quarter we had particularly particular specific expenses due to this take-back and double cost obviously, because we're still paying material and we're building up our own distribution. I don't see any acceleration in downtrading in the UK in terms of trends. And if we try to correlate this to plain packaging, clearly there's not yet plain packaging in the UK, I would say.","But in general, because I get very often this question, is UK going to become Australia. The first thing is the impact of plain packaging on Australia downtrading is extremely difficult to estimate, if any, because it's much more a question of pricing. Because if you remember, the margins at the bottom end of the market in Australia are still extremely high compared to the UK. So I personally do not see an acceleration of the trends in the UK, even if eventually plain packaging is implemented because there are already brands at very low margins at the bottom end of the market. And I don't think we'll see an acceleration of the trends.","Now in the EU in general, I don't see much downtrading here. Actually, the premium segment is stable and we grew share with Marlboro. So overall, I'm very positive about the trends in the European Union. And do not forget that we have a portfolio with Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield that covers quite comfortably all price segments. So I think we're fairly confident about the prospects of the business in the European Union.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Just want to come back to Japan. Can you confirm that I'm reading this right? Your market share table in the release, that's just cigarettes; that doesn't include any sales from iQOS. That's correct?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","This is correct.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And so would it be closer to flat market share if iQOS were included? And where do you see iQOS taking share from? Is it more from your own brands or from competitors?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we would see obviously some correction. And we should not forget that in particularly in the last quarter, there were competitive introductions in the market. And clearly because of the support of iQOS as we expand it nationally, we had no activities on our portfolio of cigarettes during that quarter, okay. So that explains both the comparisons in terms of competitive pipelining and us focusing on iQOS the higher decline in the share.","Now from what we know today, approximately 40% of the people that switch and adopt iQOS come from our own brands, which is higher obviously than our market share in Japan. But I hope this is correct because we are primarily targeting our own consumers as well, and it's Marlboro. So that's a little bit the proportion we see today, 40% coming from our portfolio and 60% from competitive brands.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And does having iQOS in the market influence any of your thinking on pricing on your cigarette brands and maybe give you more flexibility there?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. This is completely separate, okay. I don't see any.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And then just on Indonesia, the machine-made full flavor certainly has been, that segment's been gaining steam. You called out machine-made in general as part of your momentum there. But certainly in full flavor, you're underrepresented. Can you be a little more specific on any of your progress there in gaining a bigger footing in that segment?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well we are getting some part of the segment clearly, due to the success of Dji Sam Soe Magnum and Blue, which are in that segment. We introduced last year U Bold, which is a full-flavor extension of U Mild that is doing well in the areas that was launched and we plan to expand now nationally. And one of the things that shows the segment growing faster is that some of the introductions I've described previously, 20 packs for the price of 16, are labeled as full flavor but they are more low tar and nicotine product, okay. So there is some artificial boosting of that segment. But overall, we are making progress in that segment, and we have plans to further expand our presence in the segment, clearly.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just lastly on margins. Obviously, two years in a row now you've had significant spending increases in the fourth quarter. Obviously, you've called out that some of the items are transitory, but can you give a sense of where margins go from here? Do you expect a return to levels two years ago anytime soon? Is there a little bit of a new normal? What's the right way to put the margin environment in context?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well as I said in my remarks, we expect OCI to grow above our 6% to 8% range next year. So obviously, margins will expand. And we expect and we're targeting margin expansion in every \u2013 so yes, you will see a margin increase.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And specifically you said in every region as well?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","My first question, I just want to talk a little bit about your cash flow and allocation. As you highlighted in your prepared remarks, you've done a great job keeping your cash flow steady, despite the foreign currency headwinds. If you take the midpoint of your EPS guidance for 2016 though, your dividend payout is around 95%. So I was just curious if there's a level where you start to get a little uncomfortable; and kind of what lengths would you go to on the dividend to just ensure that you could at least maintain if not increase it slightly like we saw last year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as I said, we will not decrease the dividend, okay? So, yes, it is a high payout ratio, undoubtedly. And given currencies, it will remain high for the next couple of years, no matter what. I hope over time as we grow profit and we grow cash flow, we'll come back to more normal levels. And if the currencies stabilize, clearly, we'll recover much faster the return to normality, I would say. But as we always said, dividends is sacrosanct and we will go to a large extent to maintain the dividend.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That's very helpful. Just out of curiosity, is the 65% payout ratio \u2013 over the long term, obviously \u2013 is that kind of still in play? Or is that something that's kind of been pushed out a little bit, just given the currency situation?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, this discussion about 65%, as I said, is a bit theoretical short term because we will remain, no matter what happens, unless the currencies turn back to half of where they are today compared to...","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Dollars as to half. Once that the situation becomes a bit more clear on where we'll go directionally, then we'll revisit this payout ratio and we may want to modify it, okay. That kind of theoretical discussion today.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Yeah. Very good. Thank you. And then just finally, I just wanted to dig a little bit into the Philippines. It sounds like you're happy with the progress there. Even with volume down as much as it is for the category, it sounds like you're more than happy to trade the bottom end volume for the share gains on Marlboro and it's at the top end. So just curious if you could give a little bit of color on how you feel about the Philippines. Have we turned a corner there and we're going to continue to see improvement? Or is there still more work to do in that market? Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We definitely see improvement, undoubtedly. Pricing at the bottom has increased; compliance is increasing quite significantly. The back-stops have helped. And as the \u2013 finally, as of next year, we are in the final stage of merging the two tiers. Over time, we have the possibility to unleash the profitability of the market also by growing Marlboro price. So overall the prospects are extremely good, in my view, touch wood. And it's pretty clear that with these kind of margins of price increases at the bottom, you will have some total market decline temporarily because it's 50% price increase over one-and-a-half-year period. So you would expect some market decline. But overall, I think it looks pretty good, as I said. So I'm very happy with what's happening in the Philippines.","William Marshall - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Afternoon, guys. Just a quick one from me. I was just wondering in terms of projections for Indonesian industry volumes next year because I know you were saying 1% to 3% over the medium term. I was just wondering if you could be a bit more specific now and for fiscal year 2016. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. As I said, it's a slightly different forecast Indonesia at the beginning of the year. My view is, yes, there is a little bit of pricing, higher pricing this year because of a higher tax. Last year, we had a 5% tax pass on. This year, we're 7.5%. The economy is a bit softer, but on the other side, minimum wages went up 11%. So how this is going to unfold is difficult for me to forecast. We have assumed conservative some slight market decline. Whether this materializes or not, we'll know over the few months as the pass on of the prices evolves. And that's how I see the total market for the month.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Okay. Cool. Thanks very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Long term, you're right. That's the way we look at the market, 1% to 3% growth.","Owen M. Bennett - Nomura International Plc","Cool. Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Good morning, gentlemen. Just a question on costs. I think you mentioned earlier on that there was some favorable leaf costs, tow acetate and packaging. In dollar terms, could you give some indication of where those major costs are actually headed?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think overall, we see stability in leaf prices. And on clove prices, we have some favorability year-to-year, but we should not forget that we run longer inventories. So on average, you see the impact in the years to come. So the outlook there in terms of leaf and clove is pretty good. And the clove crops were fairly large, so we could secure sufficient inventories at lower prices. Our overall cost, as I said, only including RRPs, should be in the range of 1%, probably slightly below. So we see a moderation clearly in the cost going forward. Now 1% of the total cost base based on 2015 \u2013 sorry \u2013 is $150 million. That's what it is, okay?","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","And secondly, on the iQOS, clearly, when you launched in Japan and Italy, you'd managed to secure somewhat favorable tax treatment of HeatSticks, vis-\u00e0-vis combustible cigarettes. And I was wondering, given your recent launches, have you managed to achieve a similar sort of negotiated settlement with Switzerland and Russia and various other countries you've launched into?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Switzerland, for sure. Russia is still in discussion. But in the vast majority of the markets we have launched, it's lower rates than cigarettes.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","And is that actually \u2013 are you now actually pricing those HeatSticks below cigarettes, or are you still actually pricing at the same level in those markets?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","At this stage, we price parity with Marlboro, except for Switzerland, where we are slightly lower. And in Russia, where we use Parliament and Marlboro, and we're about the normal Parliament price. So we work with different pricing models and different go-to-market models of this type and clearly, with larger tool of best practices so we accelerate future deployment and also improve cost efficiency as we become a bit more intelligent about how these products with the markets.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Thanks. And lastly, just can you give us a update on where the legal challenges are to plain packaging? And indeed, is there any update on the Ukrainian-led WTO dispute?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Basically, this year is an important year because as you have mentioned of the pending cases, we have WTO; that the decision should come towards the second half of the year. And we have the UK High Court, which should rule before May, maybe earlier. So we'll know these important outcomes in the course of this year. So that's where we stand in terms of the pending cases at this stage.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. But is there anything to add to the sort of WTO dispute? Has that been taken forward?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sorry?","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Is there anything to add with regards to the WTO dispute? Has there been any particular...","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's a normal process that is followed.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Right.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","There is a lot of interest from what we understand, but we're not in the proceedings, obviously, because it's between Member States, so...","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So we'll see how this unfolds.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay.

Bloomquist - Haitong Securities (UK) Ltd.","Hi. I was wondering if you could just comment on the outlook in Australia. I mean the Prime Minister's been talking about continuing the 12.5% excise tax increases that have dented Australian volumes. Does that sound like a real risk, or will there be some fiscal sensibility in the light of rising illicit trade in your view? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, there are discussions of this nature and clearly, our explanations to the government is that they should put some stop in this out-of-cycle excise tax increases. This year, we have the last one. Now, despite all this tax increases which, as you know are pretty substantial because sometimes they are more than one Australian dollar per pack on 20s equivalent, the total market was down only 2.6% in 2015. And I think that has remarkable elasticity.","Now, downtrading has continued, although recently at a lower pace. And as far as we are concerned, our share has stabilized finally. We have increased our segment share for the discount segment, so we're in a position to influence the segment. And essentially, I believe \u2013 I mean we also announced a price increase today in Australia. So the way I see Australia is, it has been a slight drag on our OCI this year, much, much less than last year. Conservatively, we forecast another small drag next year but we'll see now how this pricing unfolds. So that's the situation in Australia. Obviously, our objective is not to have the excise tax increase out of the normal ones that are the CPI indexation.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Haitong Securities (UK) Ltd.","Great.

Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. And I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release or review the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?","Martin King","Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. I will open with some brief remarks on how we currently see our business halfway through at the year. For our combustible tobacco portfolio, the fundamentals are robust, reflecting a strong pricing environment and improving volume trends. This is a very positive sign given the majority of our profits and cash flow continues to be generated by combustible tobacco products.","With regard to IQOS, we are tracking below our very high initial expectations for this year, primarily due to the current project trajectory in Japan. However, the year-on-year performance across geographies remains very strong and we continue to view RRPs as our largest growth opportunity going forward. As Andre explained during the Annual Shareholders Meeting in May, RRPs will experience periods of acceleration and periods of slower growth as they expand.","The related timing is very hard to predict precisely, especially at this initial stage. This is the case with virtually every new product category and IQOS will invariably go through these phases. What is certain in our view is that adult smokers worldwide are looking for better alternatives for smoking. We believe that the IQOS is the best alternative on the market today as evidenced by the fact that 5.6 million adult consumers around the world have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS.","Let me now take you through our second quarter results, beginning with total shipment volume, i. e., cigarettes and heated tobacco units combined, which increased by 0.9% or by 0.6%, excluding inventory movement. This growth was driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume across IQOS launch markets, led by Japan and Korea, partly offset by 1.5% decline in cigarette volume, which includes the growing impact of adult smokers out-switching to our heated tobacco products. Importantly, heated tobacco unit volume growth in the quarter was relatively balanced with about half coming from outside the East Asia and Australia region. This illustrates the broad-based progress of IQOS across geographies.","For the first half of the year, total shipment volume declined by 0.6% and was essentially flat excluding inventory movement. Our cigarette volume decline in the quarter was due notably to Russia, mainly reflecting the impact of price increases and higher illicit trade in Saudi Arabia, primarily due to the impact of tax driven price increases, following the June 2017 excise tax introduction.","The decline was partly offset by growth in a number of markets, most notably Pakistan and Turkey, primarily reflecting higher industry volumes. We also recorded cigarette volume growth in important geographies, such as Indonesia, North Africa and the Philippines. On a sequential basis, our cigarette volume performance in the quarter marked a significant improvement compared with the 5.3% decline of the first quarter.","Turning to our second quarter financial results net revenues increased by 8.3% excluding currency, driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio and higher volume of IQOS devices and heated tobacco units. Our pricing variance for combustible products in the quarter was more than 8% of second quarter 2017 combustible product net revenues, driven by Argentina, Canada, Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. Year-to-date June, our combustible pricing variance was 7.5%.","Adjusted operating income increased by 9.8% excluding currency, reflecting the growth in net revenues coupled with lower manufacturing costs in the East Asia and Australia region, partly offset by an incremental RP investment in all IQOS launch markets. Adjusted operating income -- margin increased by 0.5 point, excluding currency. Currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS increased by 20.2% in the quarter and benefited from a lower estimated full year effective tax rate, as well as lower interest expense. Our effective tax rate in the quarter was approximately 22%, reflects the impact of a revised full year effective tax rate estimate of approximately 24%.","The reduction compared to our prior full year estimate of approximately 26% is mainly attributed to further analysis, interpretation and clarification of the scope and impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the United States. Our lower interest expense in the quarter primarily reflects the impact of our ongoing efforts to optimize our capital structure following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This included the decision to use existing cash to repay the principal of our recently matured May 2018 10-year U.S. bonds, which had a coupon of 5.65%.","Our total international market share excluding China and the U.S. increased 0.8 points in the quarter to 28.4%. The growth was driven by our heated tobacco brands, which reached 1.6%, up by 0.9 points. To put this performance into perspective, our heated tobacco brand now enjoy an international market share equivalent to that as Philip Morris, our fourth largest international cigarette brand after just over two years since the initial IQOS commercial expansion in Japan. Despite the increasing impact of adult smoker out-switching to our heated tobacco products, share for our cigarette brands was stable at 26.9%.","I will now cover our performance in select geographies, beginning with an update for two markets; Russia and Saudi Arabia that reflect previously as potential watch out. In Russia, we recorded a strong pricing variance in the quarter, mainly driven by the annualization pricing announced in the second half of 2017, and further supported by price increases earlier this year. This built on our favorable pricing brands in the first quarter and is a welcome change from 2017 during which we recorded essentially no net pricing in the market. Pricing in Russia was the main driver of the Eastern Europe region's 14.7% possible pricing variance for the year to date June period.","We continue to closely monitor the pricing environment in the market, particularly in the context of the excise tax increase that came into effect at the start of this month. Encouragingly, since June, the industry has been progressively announcing price increases in line with the tax increase pass on of 5 Rubles per pack. It is important to note, however, that there continue to be differences in timing between when price increases are announced and when they actually reached the consumer at retail.","Separately, I would like to highlight the favorable IQOS momentum in Russia, with HEETS to off-take share in Moscow of 4.4% in the quarter, up by 1.7 points sequentially versus the first quarter. This growth was supported by the successful rollout of our new digital initiatives. In Saudi Arabia, cigarette industry volume and PM in-market sales volume remained under pressure in the quarter, declining by about 24% and 40% respectively. However, the declines in both cases improved on a sequential basis as the excise tax driven price increases from June 2017 were finally lapped during the quarter.","We expect continued improvement in the sequential trends for both industry volume and our in-market sales over the balance of the year. Importantly, we will enter 2019 with this major drag on our profitability behind us. These positive developments are being reinforced by strong cigarette portfolio performances in a number of key markets, such as Germany, Indonesia, The Philippines and Turkey, as highlighted on this slide.","Turning now to IQOS in Japan. We recorded HeatSticks\u2019 market share of 15.5% in the quarter, an increase of 5.5 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. While share for HeatSticks declined by 0.3 points compared to the first quarter of 2018, let me remind you that our first quarter share was favorably impacted by a low total market in January, reflecting a cigarette inventory reduction by our main competitor. In fact, in-market sales of HeatSticks in the second quarter increased by over 5% versus the first quarter to 6.6 billion units.","We remain focused on reaccelerating HeatSticks\u2019 share growth, particularly as competitors expand the availability of the heated tobacco products. In this regard, we are rolling out a range of initiatives this year, which do not require incremental marketing expenditures to drive further switching to IQOS, including the introduction of the next generation of IQOS devices, which will offer significant improvements that address key consumer needs, including consecutive use; the planned launch of a stronger tasting HeatSticks\u2019 variant in order to facilitate full flavor adult smokers switching, as well as a main stream price product for more price sensitive consumer; the simplification of the registration process for new users, which was a significant barrier to entry, particularly for older smokers; the intensification of our loyalty program and deployment of more targeted and relevant communications for our existing and perspective IQOS users; and the already address device reliability issues in the current generation of IQOS, they have caused frustration among certain consumers.","We conservatively assume today that these initiatives will have a limited favorable impact this year with the full favorable effect coming as of the beginning of 2019. We continue to observe strong consumer interest in heated tobacco category. As of June 2018, we estimated 34.7% of adult tobacco users in Japan that use the heated tobacco product in the preceding seven days, an increase of over 2 points since March. This equates to around 150,000 additional users per month over the period. It is important to highlight that this general growth dynamic has not changed as a result of the presence of competitive products.","However, there are different patterns of full adoption depending on product with IQOS having the highest exclusive use and per device heated tobacco unit consumption. Other products appear to dilute the correlation between the number of users and the category share. Thus, the heated tobacco categories\u2019 consumption share of total tobacco volume, which reached around 21% in June, is lagging behind general heated tobacco user share, as the latter reflects an expression of interest in heated tobacco products and the potential for further conversion going forward, this offers well for both the category and IQOS.","We have previously highlighted the roll that competitive churn associated with the introduction of the new heated tobacco products to the market is having in Japan. In general, competitive products have the greatest impact following the initial launch, but critically overtime as consumers recognized the benefits of IQOS. Given the geographic expansion of the competitive products in recent periods and the related impact that this has on the national share for HeatSticks, it is helpful to look at specific geographies within Japan to help gauge better the impact of competitive introductions and the related churn on IQOS\u2019s performance overtime.","This slide shows heated tobacco unit off-take share trends in Fukuoka, Sendai and Tokyo, three geographies where multiple heated tobacco products have been available the longest. As all three geographies illustrate, the longer the competitive products are in the market, the better IQOS performs. Importantly, IQOS remains the heated tobacco proposition with the highest full conversion rate, which drives recurring HeatSticks purchase and therefore revenue.","In Korea, HEETS market share reached 8% in the second quarter, an increase of 7.8 points versus the prior year period and 0.7 points sequentially. Over the past few months there regrettably has been confusion among the adult consumers with regard to heated tobacco category. This sense primarily from government discussions on graphic health warnings for heated tobacco products, as well as the Korean FDA mischaracterization of the tar generated by such products, which we have vigorously refuted through compelling scientific evidence publicly and by directly informing our IQOS users.","Unfortunately, the KFDA has risked confusing millions of people into thinking that heated tobacco products are as harmful as cigarette, contradicting its own scientific findings. In spite of this, our existing user base is staying with IQOS, demonstrating consumer confidence in the product and its benefits based on personal experience. We have comprehensive plans in place to ensure that the confusion dissipates, so that the many adult smokers who are understandably hesitant at this time will resume switching from cigarette to the heated tobacco category.","In the EU region, IQOS continued its steady growth. HEETS reached the regional share of 1% in the quarter, up by 0.8 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. This growth was supported by strong performances across IQOS launch markets, most notably Greece and Italy, where HEETS shares have increased by 3.1 points to 4.1% and by 1.3 points to 1.9% respectively. As the marketing focus behind IQOS continues to be limited to select geographies within EU launch markets, the regional share, not to mention the national share for any specific market, clearly understates the success of IQOS.","It is also important to monitor the number of IQOS users, which serves as a leading indicator of heated tobacco unit consumption. Over the past 12 months, the estimated figure in the EU region has increased by more than fourfold to approximately 1.2 million. Importantly, we have maintained the overall level of quality of the IQOS user base as demonstrated by full and predominant conversion rates, while growing the number of users substantially. We have also been able to increase the user registration rate, which now stands at over 80%. User registration is very important as it enables us to follow and better service new IQOS users during their initial conversion journey, while also increasing the loyalty and retention of existing IQOS users.","Turning to our full year 2018 outlook. We continue to anticipate a total industry volume decline of 2% to 3%, excluding China and the U.S. Against this backdrop, we also continue to expect decline in our total shipment volume of approximately 2%. However, we now anticipate a change in the composition of our shipment volume, reflecting higher cigarette volume and lower heated tobacco unit volume compared to our prior forecast. We expect a significant increase in our global heated tobacco in-market sales volume to around 44 billion to 45 billion units, including revised more conservative assumptions regarding the impact of our product and marketing initiatives in Japan to support IQOS.","We now target heated tobacco unit shipments of around 41 billion to 42 billion units. This excludes an anticipated full year net inventory -- this includes an anticipated full year net inventory reduction of approximately 3 billion units, reflecting an estimated 4 billion unit reduction in Japan and 1 billion unit increase in other markets. We expect the reduction in Japan to be concentrated in the third quarter.","The revised shipment target represents a total net inventory adjustment swing of 5 billion units compared to our previous communication during our Annual Shareholders Meeting in May. And we had assumed a full year net inventory increase of 2 billion units. Our heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume target for this year reflects growth in the second half of approximately 60% compared to the same period in 2017 and almost 20% compared to the first six months of 2018.","We now expect net revenue growth this year of 3% to 4% excluding currency. The revision compared to our previously disclosed estimates of approximately 8% is primarily due to lower than anticipated shipments of IQOS devices and heated tobacco units, predominantly in Japan and the impact of accounting for affiliate in Argentina as highly inflationary effective July 2018, partly offset by the better than expected performance of our combustible tobacco portfolio.","Let me provide some additional granularity behind the revision, beginning with the devices, which accounts for approximately 2.5 points and mainly reflect the following; the worldwide introduction of the next generation of IQOS devices towards the end of 2018, which I touched on earlier; this requires an adjustment to current generation device inventories, while the ramp-up of new devices is expected to occur in 2019; the fact that we are reaching out to more conservative adult smokers in Japan who need more time in different communications to switch to heated tobacco, as well as the assumption of continued competitive churn as consumers experiment with other heated tobacco products; thus, impacting the rate of adult smoker acquisition; improved device reliability and longer life cycle, leading to fewer IQOS replacement purchases; higher sales of second IQOS holders versus relatively higher price full-kit purchases; and the alignment of the retail selling price for all IQOS kits in Japan to the previously discounted price of approximately \u00a58,000 independent of device registration. Given the current unit margin structure of IQOS devices, the impact of lower device sales is felt predominantly on the net revenue line with a slightly positive corresponding impact on operating income.","Heated tobacco unit shipment volume accounts for further 2 points of the revision; mainly reflecting the anticipated full year inventory reduction mentioned previously and the slower growth of in-market sales in Japan. Our revised net revenue forecast is based on the conservative view of a very limited favorable impact from our initiatives in Japan in 2018. The upward revision for our combustible tobacco primarily reflects better than expected cigarette performance across a range of geographies, notably Germany, The Philippines and Turkey. We continue to anticipate a full year combustible price variance of approximately 7% of our 2017 combustible product net revenues.","Given our year-to-date June 2018 currency-neutral net revenue growth of 8.3%, our full-year target of 3% to 4% implies a slight decline for the second half of the year on the same basis. This is primarily due to the challenging comparison that we face in the second half of the year related to the sizable shipment of HeatSticks that we made in 2017 as part of our planned inventory build in Japan. As a reminder, in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, we recorded currency neutral net revenue growth around 9% and 19% respectively.","While the inventory build of approximately 13 billion heated tobacco units was appropriate at the time given that then forecasted demand, our or heavy reliance on a single production center and the shift from air to heat rate, it is now resulting in lower heated tobacco unit shipments and related net revenues, especially as we adjust existing inventory levels, mainly in the third quarter. Consequently, we forecast net revenue growth of around 1% excluding currency in the third quarter and a decline of around 4% on the same basis in the fourth quarter.","As announced this morning, we\u2019re revising our 2018 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to a range of $5.02 to $5.12. The change primarily reflect lower anticipated heated tobacco unit shipments in Japan and the unfavorable impact of currency, partly offset by a lower estimated full year effective tax rate of approximately 24%. We continue to target net incremental investment behind RRPs of approximately $600 million for the full year. Our guidance now includes $0.07 of unfavorable currency of prevailing exchange rates excluding currency our guidance represents up to growth rate of approximately 8% to 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017.","The unfavorable $0.13 change in the currency impact on our guidance as compared to our previous guidance on May 9th is due notably to the Argentine peso and Japanese yen. For the year, we are now targeting operating cash flow of approximately $9 billion, subject to currency movements and year-end working capital requirements. We also now anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion compared to $1.7 billion that we communicated in May. The change primarily reflects lower planned spending on heated tobacco unit manufacturing equipment, driven by increased production efficiency and greater flexibility associated with dual production of our existing factories, as well as an adjustment for the revised production forecast.","In June, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualize rate of $4.56 per share. This mark the 11th consecutive year in which PMI has increased its dividend, representing a total increase of 147.8% or a compounded annual growth rate of 9.5% since PMI became a publicly traded company in 2008. The timing and magnitude of the increase reflects the Board\u2019s confidence in the growth outlook for our business, underpinned by the potential of our smoke free products, and underscores the Company\u2019s steadfast commitment to generously reward shareholders overtime.","In conclusion, the fundamental supporting our combustible tobacco portfolio are robust, namely strong pricing and a modern cigarette industry volume decline. While we are tracking below are very high initial expectations for IQOS this year, primarily reflecting the current growth trajectory in Japan, the year-on-year performance across geographies remains very strong, and we are confident that RRPs constitute our largest growth opportunity. We are implementing the right marketing and product measure to reinvigorate growth in Japan. These initiatives, which require the rightsizing this year of our existing IQOS devices and HeatSticks\u2019 inventories will position PMI well for a strong overall performance in 2019.","Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question and answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","So I appreciate all the color and your efforts to be transparent around guide down. I\u2019m just curious if you could just offer some thoughts on why you didn\u2019t update your guidance at the AGM formally?","Martin King","We\u2019ve been assessing the whole situation. We have been putting the programs in place in Japan. And we gave you quite a bit of detail at the AGM on the dynamics of the consumers, and some of the uncertainties involved. And we gave some better color on the forecast for shipments. We decided not to give a new net revenue number, because at that point in time, we were still recalculating and figuring the effects of all these pieces. But the key is we're really confident going forward in these projections. We have time now to understand the consumer situation Japan, and to put together a really good plan there. And we have a great deal of confidence going forward that we will hit these numbers, including the shipment and IMS for the heated tobacco units.","Vivien Azer","Sticking with Japan then please with the more affordable variant. Can you talk about how that will benchmark from a revenue accretion standpoint relative to some of the metrics that you guys had offered at your shareholder meeting in 2016?","Martin King","I think the key point with regard to the heated tobacco unit, whether it\u2019s mainstream price or premium price in Japan, is these products have better margins than cigarettes do. And their price, and including the mainstream variant, will be priced such that it's adding quite a bit of profitability, even above what we would get from a similar tobacco product. Because Japan, for example, our portfolio on the conventional side, has always included Marlboro Lights, Lark and other brands so we've always had brands priced at difference points within Japan. And with heated tobacco units, you're going to follow a similar logic that you need more than one price point in order to reach a broader group of consumers. And we\u2019re still going to be, on average, above the average price in Japan. And we're going to be adding profitability very strongly with our RFP portfolio in Japan and everywhere else.","Vivien Azer","One last one from me, on South Korea. Can you give us some color on how you're thinking about target market share for the full year, given the deceleration and the confusion in the marketplace?","Martin King","Well, I mean, it's unfortunate that there is confusion in Korea, because we've been growing tremendously well there. And we are still adding consumers in Korea. But unfortunately, with the confusion, we've had a pause in the rate of speed of converting people; we're sorting through it and getting them the right information, the consumers the right information, which factually we have a very good story to tell; and all the scientific backing, including coming from other government agencies.","In fact, the KFDA itself, if you read their evidence, they understand that the composition of the aerosol is much better with our products. Unfortunately, that didn't come through in their final report. So there's some confusion, but we're clarifying it. And we think that Korea will continue to grow. It\u2019s not as fast as what we had been on very good trajectory, but we'll get back to those fast speeds of growth in the future. And I think we're still going to see very good growth in the second half of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","My first question is your revenue outlook. It\u2019s much lower than previously. And you highlighted IQOS in Japan as one of the biggest drags on your top line. But I'm trying to understand your outlook for pricing or revenue for IQOS in all of your other markets. I guess, I assumed it would have bigger contribution as these markets ramp, especially given the tax benefits. And then also, do you expect you\u2019ll need to introduce lower price points in some of the other markets sooner than you had previously planned, possibly as soon as next year to increase conversion. I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of your thinking on all of this.","Martin King","Our intent is to keep the premium positioning for heat. It\u2019s important as you\u2019re establishing the new category that remain premium, you have to remember in Japan we have reached the market share, which is very, very substantial to this point where you get running out of premium smokers, if you will. And you need to expand once you hit very high market share. In other markets, we\u2019re not there yet, we will get there eventually. So certainly, if we get well into the 15%, 16% market share, we\u2019re going to have to deal with this issue in other places. But we\u2019re still not there, we are growing very rapidly in the EU. In a number of markets, we\u2019re doing extremely well. Italy, Greece, we called out already, but there are number of other markets that are growing.","And when you look at the consumer uptake, it\u2019s really taken off in the EU and we\u2019re very pleased with the results there and looking forward to higher market shares. But it will be away before we get to the point where we would need to be thinking about introducing a second line up of SKUs. But overall, I mean the HeatSticks as you point out, are very profitable in EU. They enjoy some favorable tax positioning, and it makes it quite accretive in a number of markets.","Bonnie Herzog","And then the incremental spend behind IQOS of $600 million this year. Could you update us on the phasing of this spend -- and for the rest of the year and then more color possibly on some of the initiatives that are working? You touched on the digital initiative in Russia, which seem to be having very positive effect. And then I know it\u2019s early. But how should we think about potential stepped up investments behind IQOS next year? Should we assume you\u2019ll continue to ramp spending, so you can increase further conversion in the future?","Martin King","So we\u2019re still on track for the 1,600 incremental. As far as the phasing, we\u2019re about 50% already in the first quarter. So it\u2019s pretty on track, and we\u2019ll expect about the same for next second half. Obviously, we spent half we\u2019ll have half to go. So that remains intact. We are seeing some very good impacts from some of our investments, digital, absolutely. I mean, Russia, you see the market share really talking in Moscow. Its due to a number of initiatives, digital is playing a role. We\u2019re getting better at finding leads and being more efficient in how we decide to approach those smokers. And it\u2019s paying off inefficiency that we hope.","We will see rolling across other markets towards the latter part of this year and into next year. And it really gives us much more leverage with our coaches, for example, where they can work on leads that are already verified and already delivered from the digital process. It's also helped us follow during conversion and a number of other benefits. So the spending that we\u2019re making in digital is paying off. Our retail footprint is improving. We\u2019re getting more consistent higher quality, getting more effectiveness of our retail spend. So there are number of variance where the spending is really starting to pay off, and will pay off even more in next year.","As far as next year, when we look at that 600 million, about half of it, say 300 million, will be in the base but will not grow any further. They work through specific initiatives that are being built that can handle much higher scale. So we will not need to grow or have more spending behind it in order to provide the benefits to a huge number of consumers and across all the markets. The other half will scale somewhat on how fast we rollout markets and how fast we have uptake in the consumer conversion piece. But it should not grow as quickly as the consumer pieces.","So we\u2019re looking at the profitability coming from the whole RRP investment to begin paying off much better next year and going forward, because if you realize it, the consumables are being sold at a net factory price around the world that\u2019s about twice of our average CC. So we\u2019re getting very good benefits as we grow the volume. And that allows us to amortize the costs of conversion and of these other essential initiatives over some very good profitability. And we\u2019re seeing more and more and more markets now have passed the point where they\u2019re accretive and they\u2019re profitable; obviously, Japan and Korea were there; there are number of markets in the EU there; there obviously, Italy, duty-free. So we\u2019re getting now much more benefits from all these investments and very helpful going forward.","Bonnie Herzog","And then maybe just one-time a quick one from me, I am just curious to hear how IQOS has been performing in markets where e-cigs are much more prevalent. And really what the interaction has been. And then what are your plans for introducing e-cig technology, either organically or possibly via an acquisition? Thanks.","Martin King","We don\u2019t have as much exposure to e-cigs as other companies. Our biggest e-cig exposure or markets, is in the EU, UK would be obviously the one with the highest level. We have a lower market share in UK, so a lower base from which to deploy our commercialization and so forth. So it\u2019s hard to really say where e-cigs versus IQOS. We know that IQOS is a better product from the point of view of converting consumers, especially adult smoker that has lower total usage that has higher conversion rates than e-cig. The taste is closer, the delivery of nicotine and the satisfaction of the smokers is much closer than cigarette. So we are confident that IQOS is a better option for adult smokers, and that we will be successful -- are successful when we go into markets with e-cig. One example would be like, Italy, where there are e-cigs in the market. Obviously, IQOS is doing extremely well there.","And then I think from a point of view of looking at e-cig. We think the IP in the regulation around the tobacco product of heat-not-burn is a different categories, it\u2019s difficult to replicate the IP that we have and the scientific substantiation. Whereas e-cig category tends to be much more of a commodity, the technology is pretty much weakened coil across the industry. There aren\u2019t a lot of unique IP around it. And then the regulation as a tobacco product, while we think heat-not-burn should be regulated differently than cigarettes, we recognize there\u2019ll still be regulation around tobacco products and so forth. So it makes it more difficult for competitors to come into this space if they don\u2019t have the experience of the tobacco regulation.","So overall, we do believe that e-cigs have a role to play. We have very good technology with our MESH that we\u2019ve developed. And we will be putting out a newer version of that soon. And we think that our mesh approach has better consistency. It has the better IP protection. And we\u2019ll deliver better over the long-term in the experience of consumer. So we will compete in e-cigs. We\u2019ll be very successful there. But at the same time, we feel that the winning product right now is actually in heat-not-burn and that\u2019s where we can achieve better profitability, better uniqueness and also better conversion of smokers. So we\u2019re pleased to compete with e-cigarettes in any market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","First just in terms of your EPS guidance for the full year, so ex-currency, it's now 8% to 10%, which is slightly better than the last guidance. But your tax rates now come down by about 400 basis points since beginning of the year. So that should be adding means something like 6 points to EPS growth. So I guess I am just wondering what's causing the shortfall that FX neutral guidance is actually not going up more at this point.","Martin King","It's the things we made out before. Obviously, the tax is coming better. The business is being impacted by the heated tobacco unit shipments, but also now the currency, I mean the inventory, which is about a 5 billion swing from what we talked about at the annual meeting. The devices don't have much impact because of EPS and that we're getting some offset from the CC business. So the main impact is difference between where we were projecting Japan versus where we are today.","We're still very confident in Japan and we're taking the actions necessary. And this step around inventories, for both devices and for heated tobacco units, is to clear the deck and prepare Japan for better growth going forward. So that the initiatives we put in there, the new heated tobacco unit offerings, as well as the very compelling new devices, have an opportunity to blossom and to do really well and drive our growth going forward. So we're setting the base for a better 2019, and to deliver the numbers.","Judy Hong","And just to clarify the Japan inventory impact. So when you think about third quarter. So if we assume a similar in market sales growth for IQOS in third-quarter. So if you get something like 6.5 billion units, you have an inventory reduction of 3 billion. So basically you could have an IQOS volume in the third quarter for Japan something like a three or 3.5 billion. That's the right way to model?","Martin King","I think that's about right. We're going to take the inventory adjustment of 3 billion to 4 billion in Japan, because remember the net is 3 billion. It includes a plus one by the end of the year coming from other areas. So in Japan, we're looking at about 4 billion inventory, it will come mostly in the third quarter. I think almost entirely in the third quarter. And we're you know making sure we have the right inventory of the Marlboro heated tobacco units to make room for the new line up of SKUs.","And we have a really flexible manufacturing base now we're able to supply. So rather than end up with too much inventory of any one particular product, which is hard to predict how it's going to perform going forward, especially given the pricing that's coming in the market and the tax increase October 1. So to clear the decks and have a lower inventory so we can be more flexible is what we're doing.","Judy Hong","And then just lastly, in terms of your price guidance of the combustible, I'm assuming it does not include any potential benefit from Japan. So I just wanted to confirm that. And then just confirm if you've gotten any clarity around the application that you've submitted?","Martin King","I mean, our guidance is all in. We don't carve out any particular instances. We have put in the application on conventional product in Japan. The tax increase is \u00a520 per pack. We applied for \u00a550 total increase. On the combustible side, there are some technicalities around the calculation of the device -- on the RRP, the heated tobacco unit side. There are some technicalities on how the new tax based on the weight of tobacco or consumable product is calculated. So that's held off a bit the timing of the applications but obviously, the tax is going up October 1. So we\u2019ll need to submit new price list as soon as we can for those products as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","I just have two questions for you. So I'm curious if you look at your new initiatives you have set for Japan in the second half and new devices, HeatSticks pricing and that kind of thing. Do you believe that that will increase the overall level of heated tobacco users in Japan? Is this what's going to hopefully draw in some of late adopters? And if I can add to that, you\u2019ve mentioned that there is 35% of consumers that are using new tobacco about at 21% share. And I think you have a bit of an explanation and I couldn\u2019t recall what the explanation is for the GAAP between those two figures there, if you can help with that too?","Martin King","So first of all, the number of consumers coming into the heat-not-burn category is growing. We estimate it\u2019s around 150,000 per month. And the 34.7% number is anybody any smoker who has used a heat-not-burn product in the last seven days. So it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re fully converted. It doesn\u2019t even necessarily mean they yet bought a device, but they\u2019ve tried the product. It could be also from a friend or somebody else. But it's an indication of interest and that I think is the starting point.","Then you get to the question of, will consumers convert. And this is what our initiatives are around. And we find that IQOS is the best at converting consumers and we find that it's the best product in the category, so as long as the category has interest and people are coming into it. And look we\u2019re selling over 500,000 kits and\/or holders every month in Japan. So we are bringing people into the category. It's being hidden a bit by this churn and the fact that consumers are trying many different products. And so the number of sticks per device and consumption has come down a bit. So you don't see quite the volume and share growth that you would associate with that number of consumers.","So we\u2019re convinced it\u2019s going to settle out that IQOS will win, it's the best product in the market and we will see higher rates of growth. Now that\u2019s underpin by the three buckets of things we\u2019re taking in Japan; we\u2019re improving the basics, so the device quality issue and reliability; the loyalty programs for existing users to make sure they stick with IQOS since they appreciate the brand; the holders have programs to get people the ability to do some and use in short-term; we\u2019ve simplified pricing registration and you\u2019ve got the messaging to reach a broader consumer base; and reach, for example, we flag the 50 plus group, which is pretty large in Japan; we\u2019re adapting our messaging to those to that group and focusing on smoke-free Japan; going to where they are and more suburban; there is a new campaign on the way; so that's all around messaging and consumer.","And then the products are a key part of it; the new flavor SKU; the new lineup of consumables at the mainstream price; and then very importantly, the new generation devices, which is a nice improved device; and we are convinced, it\u2019s going to do really well, even at a premium price to the existing devices, which is why we\u2019re bringing the inventory of the previous devices down, so that the new devices have room to sell. So all these things, put together, I think will increase the rate of people coming into the category.","Overtime, the churn will dissipate. It may a take a while. We still have the spread of competitive products. But you see what\u2019s happening in the cities where we\u2019ve already been in the longest, we start to tick backup. So it\u2019s got a come, it\u2019s just a matter of being more conservative in our estimates about when that will happen and making the room for these initiatives to take route and be successful through the inventory resizing. So that\u2019s the story around Japan. We\u2019re really confident in the future. We are absolutely sure that the basics are in place, the product is right and it\u2019s going to resume growth. We\u2019re just being more conservative about when we forecast that will happen and giving run through the initiatives to take place.","Chris Growe","And if I can just, one other quick one is just that -- and from a high level, I guess. When you saw in Japan and Korea the product reach up to 2.5 share. We started to see an exponential increase in market share for that, point forward. It got a real -- a lot of consumer adoption from that point, got to be well known in the market and that kind of thing. You\u2019re not seeing that quite so much in Europe. Is that what we should expect the EU is just different than Japan? Or is it around the way you\u2019re standing behind the product or anything you could add to that? Just to understand how the shares develop in the EU and when they could really take off from here?","Martin King","There are couple of markets that have accelerated notably in the last few periods. I mean, you call out Europe. Take Italy. Italy is starting to take some pretty big jumps in the share quarter-over-quarter. I mean we were at 1.5 share points in the first quarter, now we\u2019re at 1.9. So maybe it\u2019s not taking off quite as fast as Korea or Japan. But that\u2019s a noticeable acceleration in share. Russia, Moscow being the leading city for Russia. I mean, to you jump from 2.7% to 4.4% in one quarter, that is a serious acceleration.","Also, Greece is another example, and there some of other markets. I mean, I\u2019m not going to go through the whole list. But we are starting to see faster growth across a variety of markets. And I think part of it is the efficiency of our initiatives and we\u2019re learning how to do it better. Our spending is paying off better. But it\u2019s also I think which you pointed out, which is word of mouth. At some point, it gets to a critical mass where people start seeing each other using it and they start reaffirming their choice and you start to see a difference in the growth rate. And we are seeing that.","And obviously in differently geographies, it might be to different extremes, but it is significant growth and we\u2019re very pleased with the progress across EU, Russia, a number of different geographies, as well as the great success that we\u2019ve had in Japan and Korea. So it\u2019s getting very broad base now. We\u2019re very pleased with it and very confident in the future. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","My first question is really focusing around the 600 million, how you\u2019re spending and how that varies in the life of a slowdown in Japan and Korea. And I suppose what I\u2019m really trying to ask is this. It sounds like, you are ramping your marketing investments in Japan in response to the slightly disappointing trajectory in Japan. But you\u2019re keeping the 600 million stable. Does that mean to say that you\u2019re not investing as much in Europe as you would have done? And that\u2019s my first question.","Martin King","Well, in Japan, we\u2019re actually spending this year what we plan to already at the beginning of the year. We have not increased the total spending in Japan above what we had already planned. And I\u2019m sure within the 600 million that we\u2019re spending across a variety of markets, including Japan, Korea, EU, a number of different geographies. But the plans, as far as how the markets are spending it, are pretty much on track and Japan is actually right on track with its spending. So it's a step up from last year and that's maybe what you're seeing when you look through our earnings release. But that was already planned and it's already in the 600 million number, we haven't increased either the 600 nor have we increased its allocations to Japan.","Adam Spielman","And then as I look at the rest of the world, so excluding Japan and Korea, we've talked about a lot. It seems to me that certainly compared with my expectations it's doing better in certain geographies. You've called out Greece, Italy, Russia than I would expect, but correspondingly less well in others. And I'm really talking Northwest Europe here. Is that, compared with your forecast let's say this time last year, is that how you would see it as well? Better in some place, worse in others, net-net in line with what you expected.","Martin King","Well, I think we expected it to do well across the geographies. It's done a little bit better in some, obviously, and in others we're hoping to accelerate the growth. And we're still confident it'll come. I am one where it would pay off tremendously if it grew, but is challenging, is Germany. We knew, because of the characteristics of the consumer and so forth, there was a little bit more of a show-me type market and would take more effort and more incremental growth to where we get to a point.","We are growing in Germany. We're gaining consumers. We're making progress. It's going okay. But obviously, we would like to see it do better in Germany, partly because it would be extremely profitable, as well as the fact that it's a key market for us and we would like to grow it. But we're very confident it's going to happen. We are applying these new tools and the learnings and getting better every day and it is starting to move faster. But we're all always looking for more.","Adam Spielman","And very quickly, it's not my final question, the UK. I live in London, it seems to me you're making big efforts here. But I just wonder how it\u2019s doing in London?","Martin King","I think we're making progress we have good efforts on the ground there. And it's a market that is very interesting, because it has a fairly large e-cigarette component and we have consumers there. And we also would like to see it do well in the UK from the point of view of English-speaking, and would spread the word better around the world with word-of-mouth. It's going fine, we're making progress. But that's a market that we're putting a lot of focus on and trying to accelerate the growth in.","Adam Spielman","Finally, just you've dropped some hints about pricing. One thing you said, I think you said is you're applying the new device to be at a premium to the existing IQOS device. I'm intrigued by that, particularly in line of the fact that the heavy discounting from the glo device and to some degree from plume. And also I think I heard you say that you're definitely planning to submit a new price list for IQOS in Japan in due course to deal with the tax rise on IQOS. Is that correct?","Martin King","So for the existing line up of devices in Japan, we said the price now as a simple one price as opposed to the situation before where you had discounting and you had most consumers having to go through the registration process to get the discount price. It also gave the impression the device being marked down. So we made it simple. We simplified the registration. We also didn't require the registration in order to get the same price, the \u00a58000 price, which is where most consumers were getting to anyway but only after some pain and suffering.","And that was also in anticipation of bringing the new line-up of devices. The plan all along was when the new devices arrive would be to have two price tier system for the existing line-up and then the new and improved line-up at a higher price. None like you would see for other electronics product line-up. So we just accelerated that, took away the pain and suffering of having to go through a long process to register and get the price, which you should have gotten anyway and put it there. So yes, when the new line-up comes, it will be an improved device. It will offer better functionality, performance, design, all the great things and consecutive use too, by the way. And so in general, it will be priced above the older device, which you would expect that that\u2019s not surprising.","As far as the consumables pricing, I was just referencing in October 1st, there is a tax increase in Japan for both RRP and conventional cigarette. So obviously, you need to have your price list in before any tax increase. We've already put our price listing for the combustible. And so we were delayed a bit by this technicality on the rest of our portfolio, and so that\u2019s what I was referring to.","Adam Spielman","But the new retail price will be higher to take into account the tax increase on the consumables of IQOS?","Martin King","There is a tax increase and we\u2019re going to file a price list that deals with that. I can't comment further on pricing.","Adam Spielman","And one thing I didn\u2019t ask. You feel the \u00a58,000 is right in the lights of the \u00a53,000 for some glo devices?","Martin King","We\u2019re still selling a nice amount of devices, and we do have a superior product we believe. So we want to have the premium positioning. So yes, I think this is about the right price.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","I just wanted to touch on Russia. It's your largest cigarette market where you\u2019ve launched IQOS. And you\u2019ve highlighted some of the momentum there. Can you just help me to reconcile a few of the data points you\u2019ve given. You talk about the 4.4 share in Moscow, and that\u2019s close to 10% of the population of that country. I think you\u2019ve also got almost 1 billion sticks in that region, which is primarily Russia and Ukraine. I guess, I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with your appendix 1 where you show zero rounding, I suppose, to zero market share for Russia. If you took say half of the segment number divided by the market size, you\u2019re still looking at around 0.7 or 0.8 share. Obviously, the 4.4 at around 10% in the country would be close to four tenths of a share. Why is there no share registering on the national basis and how should we think about tying all that together?","Martin King","I think this has to do just with the data source for the shares at Nielsen for Russia, I think. It may just be that -- I\u2019m not sure, to be honest with you. It may just be that the way we pick up share in Russia is still not picking up in Moscow rather, it's still not picking up in there. But I honestly don\u2019t have the answer for that\u2026","Michael Lavery","Can you give us a sense of what the split is between Russia and Ukraine, or any other markets in that segment? Just how big the -- when you look at that shipment number, how much of that is coming from Russia?","Martin King","We really haven\u2019t split it out by market. Obviously, Russia is probably the biggest component but it\u2019s not split by that.","Michael Lavery","And now that you\u2019ve got no issues with capacity, would you -- are you looking at a national expansion in Russia, or further expansion beyond? I know you called out Moscow typically. You\u2019re also in St. Petersburg as well. What\u2019s your thinking about reaching beyond those?","Martin King","We\u2019re having terrific results in Russia. So logically, we would expand -- we will expand, yes. We will continue to expand in Russia. I\u2019m not going to say when and so forth. But absolutely, with the results that we\u2019re having and the programs working so well, it\u2019s only logical that we will continue to expand in Russia.","Michael Lavery","Or any sense of timing maybe as a better way to put it?","Martin King","No, not at this time\u2026","Michael Lavery","And then just one more on Japan, there is the smoking ban coming into place. It looks like that applies the heated tobacco as well. How does that influence your outlook for the market there, and just any thoughts on what you expect from that coming through?","Martin King","I don\u2019t think we really have an impact from that on the market development, going forward. I mean, usually smoking bans aren\u2019t a big impact on volume in the market. I think it\u2019s disappointing if they don\u2019t allow heated tobacco units, because I think it is materially different to combustible and it should allowed, it does not impact into our air quality, we have the studies to prove it. In fact we did a study in Japan on actual consumers and looking at the biomarkers and individuals, and proved that the IQOS device does not impact air quality or give a problem to non-smokers in the area.","Nick Rolli","Michael just a follow up -- Michael it\u2019s Nick. That ban does apply to both combustible and heat-not-burn. They\u2019ve carved out some differences between the two. So I think that\u2019s the good news is to recognizing the heat-not-burn category as a bit different.","Michael Lavery","Just to clarify then you said it does apply to both, but there\u2019re some carve outs\u2026","Nick Rolli","There are some differences and I can get you the specifics on that after the call. In restaurants, and bars and things you maybe\u2026","Martin King","I think there\u2019re different categories\u2026","Nick Rolli","Something like the establishments and things of that nature where you can\u2019t use CC but you can use heat-not-burn.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.","Jonathan Leinster","Just going back to previous question. What plans have you got if any for the full commercialization of platforms two, three and four? Where are we in that?","Martin King","So platform two, which is the heat-not-burn product, deliver similarly to platform one but it uses carbon tip to generate the energy. That product has been launched in a limited city test in the Dominican Republic. We\u2019re gathering consumer data and consumer information on that and preparing to ramp up the production. And we\u2019ll give plans for that going forward. Platform four, which is the e-cigarette MESH product I referred to before, is -- the new version of it is being finalized and it will be launched soon.","And it is an improve technology that we believe and a differentiated from others in e-cigarette category. So we have high hopes for that product and continue development of that product going forward to deliver better satisfaction to smokers. So that will be put out in its market before the end of the year. And then platform-three is little bit more in development and we don't have it in test market yet. But we will get into a test market as soon as we can.","Jonathan Leinster","Does that mean we should expect -- when will we expect first national launch of any of these products?","Martin King","We haven't said, so don't have any new update on that.","Jonathan Leinster","Secondly, certainly there was trade press, suggesting that the announced IQOS factory in Germany was no longer going to go ahead. Is that true? And there are some of the other ones that you announced too; Romania, Greece, the Dublin, the size in Italy, Switzerland investment, Russia investment? Are some of those also being scaled back or perhaps not going ahead?","Martin King","We're reevaluating our whole CapEx for RRP. The reality is we're in good shape with RRP capacity. We have better efficiency with the spend because you have better up time. We've had lower waste numbers and we've also figured out how to better use some existing facility layout. And with the new growth forecast we're in pretty good shape. So we have now changed the timing on some of our spending for CapEx, that's why we have lower CapEx number for the year. And we're going to continue to evaluate the footprint for RRP going forward.","We don't have any announcements on individual factories, but we're doing the assessment now. And we'll give more information to the individual areas as they might be impacted or not. From a company perspective, it's a story of us being more effective and efficient with spend and phasing of the timing of our investment on CapEx to match the situation.","Jonathan Leinster","And within Japan now, you may or may not be able to answer this. But I mean is there going to be direct connection when you're talking about potentially launching higher tar and nicotine product but also lower price products. Is there actually going to be a direct connection between the pricing and the level of tar and nicotine? In other words, is there going to be a -- is the market going to be stratified into a higher priced product, which are more flavorsome but more tar and nicotine and the lower price product, which perhaps gives less of a kick. Or is that not going to be the case?","Martin King","That is not going to be the case. We're not launching higher tar and nicotine product. We said more flavorful. First of all, tar doesn't really make sense when you talk about heated tobacco units. The aerosol is dramatically different. It's not really -- tar doesn't really make sense in the case of those. And the nicotine level doesn't necessarily go with the flavor level. It's about the selection of tobaccos in the way we make the tobacco, print tobacco in the raw that creates a different flavor.","So we're talking about more flavorful ones that -- products that give more taste in the consumer experience in order to bridge better to full flavor smokers. But it's nothing to do with tar and nicotine. And as far as price goes, we're going to have a line-up of different flavors. We would not price according to the flavor or the nicotine amounts or anything like that, nothing like that, no.","Jonathan Leinster","And lastly I think, historically, you\u2019ve talked about having a new EPS algorithm at some point in 2018 given the uncertainties. Is that still the plan at some point, or is that perhaps going to be later?","Martin King","We have our Investor Day that\u2019s coming up at the end of September, and we will talk about the future in much more depth there and talk about the different aspects of our growth and the very positive plans we have for the future. I think that\u2019s probably the best venue in which to talk about longer-term prospects on growth for the Company.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","I think you may just filled my question in talking about long-term is more of a long-term question. So I\u2019m assuming you\u2019ve modeled a number of scenarios internally. And so with that respect you\u2019ve spoken quite bullishly in the past when IQOS was continuing to grow very strongly. The double-digit organic sales growth each year was possible going forward. My question is if IQOS growth stays at the current rate, we increasingly see lower-price variants introduced like you plan to do in Japan, and perhaps later becomes much more prevalent on a global basis than you had expected. And what sales growth will be expected in that scenario?","Martin King","I mean, first of all, we don\u2019t believe that scenario is reflected with what's going to happen. The heat not burn category is profitable. The products that we sell in that category are more profitable than our convention cigarette products and we think it will stay that way, some of its coming from tax differentials. We think we have very good arguments for maintaining tax differential. We\u2019ve been very successful around the world having these products at a lower tax than conventional cigarettes. And if you couple that with the fact that the production costs are roughly the same as cigarette and the trade margins are the same as cigarette, you have a much more profitable category.","We think it\u2019s defensible with our IP and the regulatory situation around tobacco. We think that the conversion costs are reasonable given the higher income stream coming from the higher margins on these products, and they are coming down the conversion costs as you amortize the central costs and the set up costs over more and more volume. The conversion costs will come down and the scale will help us with that. We\u2019re building brand equity with IQOS. So we have every reason to believe that the profitability of IQOS and heat-not-burn category, in general going forward, will be very good and better than cigarette and we are very confident in that scenario.","I think the success we\u2019ve had around the world and the fact that these products and these markets, even at relatively low market shares, are accretive in adding profitability to the Company is a testament to that.","Owen Bennett","But then just in terms of when you speak about double-digit organic sales growth. I mean, even given the trends we\u2019re seeing right now. Do you think that is still a long-term possibility, or perhaps that needs to come in some more?","Martin King","I mean, I think at Investor Day, we\u2019ll talk about the further out periods. I think 2019 will be a better year for us. We\u2019re lapping some challenges around Saudi for this year that 3 EPS point. The combustible business is better and strong, it\u2019s improving. We\u2019ve got volume. We\u2019ve got share improved on combustible. We\u2019ve got pricing that\u2019s going well. Our investments going forward, I already talked about, are more manageable in the out years, because you don't step up the infrastructure cost that you built for bigger volumes.","We\u2019re taking the inventory rightsizing and the initiatives in Japan that will help set the deck for 2019 and help the initiatives in Japan really take effect, and get us better growth there. And then you\u2019ve got tremendous growth across a bunch of geographies on IQOS this year that are very well for the future next year. So I can tell you 2019 we\u2019re quite confident in and very bullish about and we can talk more at Invest Day about the longer-term and the different elements of our growth.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","I just wanted to ask about the combustibles business and what\u2019s driving the improved expectations there. Is it less cannibalization from IQOS? And are you reallocating some incremental investment back into the cigarette business?","Martin King","No, I think that the spending is -- just the flip side of what we\u2019ve talked about with the $600 million on RRP. We haven\u2019t really changed greatly the investment plans behind the combustible category. And our pricing went very well this year across a broad series of geographies, so that\u2019s helping the overall. And our share is doing better. I mean there were another -- a number of markets that have been dragging on us, which are now turned around.","I mean, you go to the Asia, South and Southeast Asia region; Indonesia is positive share this year and doing better on first half on volume; Philippines, we\u2019re getting great share growth in the Philippines and the profitability is improving. From a volume perspective; Thailand and Pakistan are adding, whereas before it wasn\u2019t as much; Turkey, the market is growing due to illicit coming back into the legal market, and we\u2019re benefiting greatly from that; in Germany, our pricing and initiatives went very well this year. We had growth in share in the second quarter. And so it\u2019s starting to deliver some good benefits.","So it\u2019s a broad range of geographies where the brands are doing well, the pricing is a bit better and the overall market volumes, in a few cases, are a bit better like I mentioned in Turkey but also in some of the geographies that had been causing us issues before. We have situations and we have volume coming back from illicit due to a number of factors like in Pakistan the new tax tier, et cetera. So you add it all up and we have a very good picture, going forward, not just for the second quarter but going forward on the conventional products business.","Pamela Kaufman","And then I was just wondering if you can elaborate on the commercialization strategy for the next generation IQOS device. Are you going to be rolling it out across all markets or initially just in Japan\u2026","Martin King","I think you\u2019re going to have to wait and see on that one. I can tell you that we\u2019re very excited about this new generation of devices. They really are better from the way the consumers use them, the interface, the way they look and the performance of them. And we have a good plan for introducing them and you\u2019ll have to wait and see.","Pamela Kaufman","And can you comment on the battery life. How many uses the device have?","Martin King","We flagged as one of the drivers of having to reduce inventories and device sales, going forward, is that that we\u2019re finding that our devices are actually holding up better as far as the life of the battery, if you will. You buy a battery and it\u2019s rated for a certain number of cycles. But the reality is in the real life and with the consumer use, people are tending to get more cycles out. So the replacement rate for battery life issues is actually turning out to be bit lower than what we had planned. And therefore, consumers can hang onto them and use them for a longer period of time. So the batteries in these devices are fantastic technological quality and they are lasting better.","Operator","Thank you. That was our final question. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin King","I just want to close with just reiterate three key points for our outlook. First of all, the base business we talked about it, it\u2019s doing better. We've got improved volume to share. The Marlboro is doing well across the world and the pricing is coming in very nicely this year. The RRP growth is substantial. Year-over-year, we're growing our IMS, nearly doubling it and it's really broad based. It\u2019s covering a number geographies, not just Asia now with Japan and Korea which are great success stories, but also EU, Russia, other markets are starting to kick in with significant additions to our volume growth.","And the last point is that we've taken some decisive actions to improve our growth, going forward. In Japan, in particular, the initiatives we put in place in rightsizing these inventories. We're doing that in order to give us better results, going forward, not only that the initiatives have better impact but also prepare the decks for 2019. So we're very confident about the future. We look forward to giving more detail at Investor Day, and we look forward to improve results going forward. So thanks very much, everybody.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 second quarter results. You may access the release on our Web site at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2015 and comparing them to the same periods in 2014, unless otherwise stated.A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site.Reduced risk products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second quarter. Organic cigarette volume was strong declining by a modest 1.4% due to lower cigarette industry volume across all regions, partly offset by market share gains in Asia, EEMA and Latin America and Canada region. On a June year-to-date basis, our organic cigarette volume was essentially flat or down by approximately 1% excluding inventory movements. For 2015, we forecast an organic cigarette volume decline in the range of 1% to 1.5%.","Net revenues and adjusted OCI in the quarter were up by 4.5% and 6.1% respectively excluding currency and acquisitions. This growth was driven by strong pricing across all regions partially offset by lower volume largely in the Asia and EU regions. Adjusted diluted EPS excluding currency grew by 9.2% to $1.54. June year-to-date adjusted diluted EPS grew by 15.8% excluding currency. This growth benefited from a gain in Korea related to inventories built ahead of the excise tax increase effective January 2015. As announced in our earnings release this morning we are reaffirming our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in a range of $4.32 to $4.42.","Our guidance includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15 per share at prevailing exchange rates. Excluding currency, our 2015 guidance continues to represent a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. Giving our better than anticipated volume and market share performance we now expect to be towards the upper-end of this range. As previously communicated our guidance includes incremental investment during the second half of the year to support the deployment of iQOS in Japan, Italy and additional 2015 launch markets. Our guidance now also includes accelerated spending in the fourth quarter behind planned iQOS launches in 2016, as well as incremental marketing investment in the second half to further reinforce the favorable momentum of our combustible business.","As discussed in today\u2019s press release, our guidance excludes the potential impact of the motion that is currently before the Qu\u00e9bec court of appeal related to a judgment involving the two-class actions against our Canadian affiliate Rothmans, Benson & Hedges. Should the court of appeal deny the motion PMI expects to incur an after-tax charge of approximately $0.09 per share in the second quarter which would have a corresponding impact on our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance. Apparently RBH\u2019s appeal on the merit of the case is pending before the appeal in court.","Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our current guidance remains unchanged versus our April guidance there has been a shift since then in its composition. As you can see on this chart the positive impact of the euro has been offset notably by the unfavorable impact of the Russian ruble. Strong pricing was the key driver of our financial performance, in the second quarter we recorded a variance of $540 million reflecting higher pricing across all four regions. We increased the retail prices during the quarter in key markets such as Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Russia. Our June year-to-date pricing variance of $1.1 billion leaves us well positioned to achieve a full year pricing broadly in line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion.","As a reminder, our first up pricing volumes includes the gain in Korea that I discussed earlier. Our results in the quarter were underpinned by continuous market share gains. Share in our top-30 OCI markets grew by 0.1 points to 37.5% with our share up or essentially flat in 17 of this market. Our share performance was supported by the strength of our leading brand portfolio which continues to benefit from the rollout of our new commercial approach. The integration of marketing and sales expertise increased consumer focus and field salesforce empowerment are proving to be a competitive advantage.","Importantly, Marlboro was a key contributor to our share growth. The brand\u2019s international share excluding China in the U.S. increased by 0.3 points to 9.5%, this performance was broad-based with share up in all four regions. Marlboro share benefited from the federal rollout of the new 2.0 architecture which was introduced in some 20 additional markets during the quarter predominantly in the EEMA region. By year-end, we expect to have rollout Marlboro 2.0 in approximately 100 markets.","I will now provide an update on selected geographies beginning with the EU region. Cigarette industry volume in the second quarter declined by 3% or 2.3% excluding trade inventory movements. Consequently, we now expect a decline of 3% to 3.5% for the full year versus our previous forecast of approximately 4%. Our new forecast reflect the improving microeconomic conditions and moderation in the level of illicit trade led out switching to fine cut products and the lower prevalence of e-vapor products. The moderation the level of illicit trade in the quarter is consistent with the findings of an annual study published by KPMG in May. It\u2019s concluded that the consumption of counterfeit and contraband products declined in 2014 across most EU markets with France and the UK being notable exceptions.","While our cigarette market share for the EU region was stable at 40.4% in the second quarter our top-three brands, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield all gained share. Marlboro cigarette share was up in four of the top six largest markets by industry volume with particularly strong growth in Germany and Spain. However Marlboro share declined in Italy following the brand\u2019s move above the \u20ac5 per pack retail price point during the first quarter. Adjusted OCI grew by 4.9% in the quarter excluding currency and acquisitions driven by strong pricing which more than offset our cigarette volume decline due to a lower total market.","Turning now to Russia. The decline in cigarette industry volume accelerated to 4.2% in the quarter resulting in a June year-to-date decrease of 6.5%. We now expect a full year decline towards the lower end of our 8% to 10% forecast range. However, the economic environment remains fragile and we are witnessing some signs of down-tradings to the low price segment. Our excellent performance in this important market continues in the quarter. We recorded a May quarter-to-date share gain of 0.8 points to reach 27.6% driven notably by above premium parliament, as well as low price Bond Street and super-low mix, the above which also benefited from wider distribution in the Eastern part of the council. Our cigarette volume grew by 5.3% in the quarter. The combination of the volume increase and higher unit margins driven by significant retail price increases resulted in strong double-digit OCI growth in the quarter excluding currency.","I will now cover selected markets in our Asia region beginning with Indonesia. Cigarette industry volume declined by 4.6% in the quarter, following strong first quarter growth of 6%. On a June year-to-date prices industry volume increased by 0.4%. The shift in adult smoker\u2019s preferences from hand-rolls to machine-made kretek cigarette continued in the second quarter with the expansion of the overall machine-made kretek segment driven by the accelerated share growth of full-flavor products. The segment share of lighter-tasting products declined slightly. Our market share increased by 0.5 points to 35.2 despite our relatively high exposure to the declining hand-rolled kretek segment. The share growth was led by Dji Sam Soe Magnum which helped drive a 2.5 point increase in our share of the machine-made full-flavor kretek segment and Sampoerna A our leading machine-made lighter-tasting kretek brand.","During the quarter we further realigned our production from hand-rolls to machine-made kretek cigarette. While this had an adverse impact on the Asia region's cost in the quarter, it should provide an operational foundation better suited for long-term growth. Over the mid to long-term we expect cigarette industry volume to increase within a range of 1% to 3% annually driven by the growing adult population and rising income levels.","We forecast growth towards the lower end of this range in 2015 due to the recent softening of the economic environment. As announced last month Sampoerna will explore options to comply with the Indonesian Stock Exchange's mandatory requirement of 7.5% minimum public shareholding by January 30, 2016. This includes potential capital market transactions.","In Japan cigarette industry volume increased by 11% in the quarter due to the timing of retail trade inventory movements related to the April 2014 tax driven price increases. However, industry volume declined by 1.7% excluding this distortion and by 2.6% on a June year-to-date basis consistent with our forecast of for a full year decline of 2.5% to 3%. Our market share declined by 1 point in the quarter to 25.4% so it was down by a more modest 0.4 points after adjusting for inventory movements. We continue to invest behind our brand and for 2015 expect our share to be broadly in line with last year's level. We\u2019re supporting the Marlboro 2.0 architecture which we began rolling out at the end of March and also investing behind our strong pipeline of innovation as highlighted by the recent launch of the two large variance in the rapidly growing new taste menthol segment.","In the Philippines the competitive environment continues to improve during the quarter benefiting from the introduction of tax terms. Smoking prevalence remained stable in the quarter, however average daily consumption declined due to higher retail prices. Although it did not deteriorate on a sequential basis compared to the first quarter. This indicates that adult smokers have largely adjusted to higher prices at the bottom of the market. While our market share declined due to higher estimated duty paid volume by our principle local competitor, Marlboro's share increased by 2.1 points to 20.2%. The brand benefited from improved price cost which helped drive the volume increase of 18.1%. As a result of the improved competitive environment and the excellent performance of Marlboro we\u2019re increasingly optimistic about the OCI outlook for the Philippines and are expecting strong growth this year excluding currency.","Turning now to our RRP portfolio, we will commence the national expansion of iQOS in Japan this September. Building on the success of our pilot launch in Nagoya, iQOS will be rollout in few regions at the price of \u00a59,980 or approximately $80. The rollout will feature an upgraded version of our iQOS in new colors and textures to broaden its appeal among adult smokers. Our expansion plan for Italy also remains on-track with additional city launches commencing later this year. I am also extremely pleased to announce the launch of iQOS in Switzerland this August. The launch will focus on five major cities with retail distribution in approximately 250 outlets by the end of October. The iQOS kit will feature the upgraded version of iQOS while the Marlboro HeatSticks will be available in regular, smooth and menthol variants.","On our e-commerce platform the kit will have a retail price of CHF 80 or approximately $85 and HeatSticks will return with a premium positioning at CHF 8 per pack of 20. We generated free cash flow of $2.9 billion in the first half of the year. This was in line with our free cash flow for the first half of 2014 despite an adverse currency impact of $1.6 billion. Our resilient cash flow performance was supported by prudent cash flow management particularly with regard to working capital and capital expenditures. For 2015 we forecast free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year\u2019s level despite the significant currency headwind.","In conclusion our excellent start to the year was reinforced in the second quarter with a modest organic cigarette volume decline and a strong currency neutral financial result driven by robust business fundamentals. In the combustible business our superior brand portfolio supported by a superb commercial organization is driving strong pricing and continued market share gains. Meanwhile our iQOS pilot launches are performing well we\u2019re on-track with further rollouts in Japan and Italy and will soon be launching the product in Switzerland.","We remain committed to returning 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders. As of last Friday\u2019s market close our dividend yield of 4.9% was significantly above that of our tobacco peer growth and a 10 year U.S. treasury notes. On a currency neutral basis, our 2015 EPS guidance reflects the growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02. Given our better than anticipated performance we now expect to be towards the upper-end of this range.","Thank you. And now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So first I guess if we think about your guidance for the full year you\u2019re thinking the FX neutral earnings growth is coming in at the upper-end of the range. Obviously the first half has been pretty strong. So it sounds like maybe there is some incremental spending that you kind of called out around the iQOS as well as the combustibles. So, is there a way to kind of quantify some of that incremental spending beyond what you had anticipated at the beginning of the year? And then what is sort of prompting some of that incremental spending both on the iQOS side and then on the combustible side?","Jacek Olczak","Look Judy clearly as I said in my remarks there is incremental spending by accelerating some 2016 launches of iQOS towards the beginning of the year and we have to ramp-up the infrastructure already and preparations already this year. As we increasing the investment behind the combustible business but as you have noticed I mean there we have a very strong momentum share growth momentum in a number of markets behind Marlboro and other international brands so we think it\u2019s just the right time to further support the performance of this brand. And frankly speaking we slowly start looking more already into the 2016 we\u2019ve had things that will have a very strong 2016 but we are trying to maintain that momentum going forward. I will -- you have to excuse me but I will rather not quantify how much is the next job but clearly will be above our guidance absent this additional investment.","Judy Hong","And then just in the second quarter the margins in Asia came in a little bit softer and I think underlying FX neutral earnings or operating income growth was down a little bit which I guess it\u2019s a little bit surprising given the strong volume performance that you had in Japan. So I know you sited the Indonesia distribution expenses. Can you just talk about kind of the puts and takes in terms of the second quarter Asia margins? And is the Indonesia cost increases sort of one-time for the quarter or is this sort of a continuation into the next few quarters?","Jacek Olczak","I think in Indonesia and specifically we had an extra expense in Q2 connecting with reallocating of the capacity between our hand-rolled facilities and the machine-made facilities. So this is more of the sort of the one timer but it\u2019s clearly hits the entire Asia regions when it comes to the profit margins and overall profitability. I think for the full year, Asia clearly will have better much better performance that we had last year but last year Asia had a pretty I could say a lower lousy performance okay. But Asia is hitting towards their needs to -- is approaching their needs to long-term growth target. I mean they may miss it by a bit but I think Asia overall is looking good going forward for the full year.","Judy Hong","And then my last question, just on the Sampoerna decision that I guess you\u2019re looking at in terms of some of the capital market transaction potentially. Can you just help us how you\u2019re thinking about some of that decision? And to the extent that there is additional cash flow that comes in with that transaction would you think about that giving it some cushion to raise the dividends and start resuming the share buyback?","Jacek Olczak","Well, first we need to make a decision which other new -- we actually - we\u2019re finally pursue in Indonesia but -- so I was parked for a moment the question how will a distributor eventual proceed from the transaction if the transactions happened I will just close that question, park that questions for the later. As you know I mean there is on the one hand the requirements to have public flow of over 7.5% we\u2019re clearly below that 7.5% on the other hand you have a increased out rolls which are not necessary the most effective versus somehow in between these two parameters we\u2019ll have to make our decision. But I will just -- we have to wait there some time until we conclude what is the best option for the Company and the shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","My first question has to do with your outlook on pricing, it clearly it\u2019s been incredibly robust in the first half of the year and you noted the benefit of Korea. But as I look to the back half given how much pricing you\u2019ve already realized. Are there any other callouts in terms of you guys ending up realizing pricing roughly in line with your historical average because right now it would look like you would be tracking ahead of that?","Jacek Olczak","We might come slightly above the historical average therefore the language which we use is they will brought in line so don\u2019t haunt by $20 million or $30 million. But I think we are looking into the strong pricing for this year but overall pricing environment with the tax and the volumes total industry volume I think are playing on our side. So yes we\u2019re looking for the strong pricing for this year.","Vivien Azer","The second question has to do with Russia while it\u2019s encouraging to hear that you think volumes will come in at kind of the better end of the range is offset being the down-trading it feels to me like the down-trading has been at play for a while given the outsized volume gains that you\u2019ve seen for your lower priced brands. So could you elaborate on that comment a little bit? Are you seeing down-trading accelerating, is that coincident with the second price increase having hit any other color I think would be helpful?","Jacek Olczak","I think that\u2019s not until the Q1 I remember the same questions would been asked at that time I said that we don\u2019t really observe much of an down-trading growth or down-trading at all in Russia I mean as we are currently into Q2 yes there was a price increase which was hitting the market in between I mean yes you could see that the market somehow consolidate in middle I mean the super low price segments are losing the low price it\u2019s gaining the premium is slightly losing. So yes you have a down-trading. And we\u2019ve always had the Russia on the watch out list due to the underlying macros and the overall sentiment et cetera. Good news is that the Russian volumes I mean it seems that we are confronted with a bit better elasticities that we price elasticities which we initially assumed. Hence our revision that more likely or most likely Russia will end the year with about 8% or closer to 8% industry volume decline versus the initial range of 8% to 10%. The volumes for the year-to-date are pretty strong taking into consideration overall market situations and the pricing taken.","So yes I mean a down-trading is where we start seeing. Now it\u2019s not really a big surprise because Russia operates with a comfort and a matured market with a pretty wide price drops. And the gap between a premium and the low price cigarettes are much higher than would you for example seen in the Western or in the European Union. So yes there is some room for the consumers to at least temporarily mitigate some of the micro headwinds by hopefully temporary going to the lower price segment. But remember Russia is one of the markets when you see the down-trading if micro is a bit of reoccur situations improve we could see the up trading. Good news for us is that I think portfolio wise and I think this was supported by the performance of our -- two or three brands but bumps -- bumps through next to the bottom of the market and premium model parliament or a cost premium parliament which all three brands are gaining share. So portfolio wise we\u2019re okay we still have to continue watching how Russia unfolds in terms of dynamics between the price segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","I just had two questions first within EEMA results were obviously still quite good on an overall basis given all the volatility in the region, but I\u2019ve noticed the price mix in OCI growth for both but it\u2019s below trend. Typically we\u2019ve seen them growing at a double-digit rate. So what factors could you call out that have contributed to the more moderate rate of growth in the quarter?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think the pricing was coming stronger and as planned I think you will slightly presumably would have an impact of some sort of a mix, I mean partially driven by Russia, okay, so this is what it is but overall I think EEMA is and Russia in particular we are expecting very strong performance this year for the full year both Russia and the EEMA. I mean a few other locations the upper geographies in EEMA which have a strong performance, North Africa I mean a few others so I think we feel positive on the outlook for this year for instance.","Matthew Grainger","And second question just on iQOS in Switzerland. Can you talk a little bit more about the determination of the price point for the HeatSticks themselves and just at a broader level what have your leanings\u2019 been from Italy and Japan on relative price points. How does the retail price weighed francs compared to comparable pack of Marlboro cigarettes? Do we have any clarity on the tax treatment?","Jacek Olczak","Marlboro HeatStick for the pack of 20 is slightly below the Marlboro I think that it's 8 fracs 50 we decided to go in this market with Marlboro with 8 we have had a tax ratification and as in Japan in Italy iQOS HeatSticks are not classified as a cigarette product and hence will enjoy the lower taxation than the combustible cigarettes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little more on our Marlboro Architecture since you have seen such a positive impacts from Marlboro 2.0 in several markets and then could you give us an idea which particular markets do you feel there could be even more upside potential?","Jacek Olczak","Look it\u2019s rolling as we speak as Marlboro 2.0 in the additional market as I said by year-end we should see the mark of about 100 markets so that essentially must covers most of our important geographies and as well we see and I think if you look at the performance of Marlboro in Germany I think it's clearly is an impact of a Marlboro 2.0 I think I would say that performance in Germany actually goes above our expectations and if I look at the demographics how we manage to change the demographic behind the Marlboro so it\u2019s not just the market share current but also how the demographic if goes well from the future of Marlboro I mean Germany would be one of the market that we can see the further upside. But in general in essentially all geographies Marlboro the new support I mean all sorts of connected with the commercial approach et cetera, I mean the year the result.","Bonnie Herzog","And that\u2019s a good point and you mentioned Germany because clearly it's done very well, so how realistic do you think it would be to assume the performance that you have seen there could be replicated in some of the other key markets?","Jacek Olczak","Well it is being replicated, I mean it might be to the -- not to that extent as in Germany but overall if I look at the changing demographics behind the Marlboro the LA 24 share the values of Marlboro of how Marlboro resonates more on the dynamic innovative sort of a brand. I mean this qualitative assessment of the Marlboro is by far better in essentially all geographies when we launch brand. I can't find in memory a market which wouldn't a big one. Our market share performance in a current period from place-to-place may also being targeted by the given the price situations I would call out for example Mexico, right? Where yes there is a bit of a down-trading in the market there are some pricing pressures at the bottom of the market so you might have a temporary sort of the brand share erosion but what we really focus on is to making sure that the underlying demographics behind the brands are getting better because this really once the pricing is unlocked also I mean that really will support or should support the further growth of the brand. So even in the market where Marlboro has a little bit of a share pressure within a premium segment Marlboro actually is the -- is performing very strong and is gaining share.","Bonnie Herzog","And then Jacek you guys announced the extension of your strategic framework with Altria Group. So what do you think the biggest benefit will be for instance could it be the acceleration of the pace that you are bringing new products to market, and\/or increasing the number of new products? And then maybe could you give us an idea of how much your investment is behind reduced risks products broadly could increase as a result of this extended framework?","Jacek Olczak","Because as of existing as you remember agreement with Altria on the current generation of a cigarette product, and this agreement essentially will focus both companies will take them both companies focus behind the new generation of a cigarette focus I think Altria is bringing to the face of the table quite a knowledge on the existing products and other critical components I mean there we have our own research our own discoveries our own fruits of the investments in through R&D. And I think it make a good sense for both companies from the resource management propose the resources together and they work for jointly on the new generation. I think logically this should result in a acceleration of a development of a new generation cigarettes product and obviously in above us both companies could be in their respective markets faster in addressing the consumer needs. I wouldn\u2019t you will appreciate I wouldn\u2019t say how much in terms of a financial investment is required for obvious reasons.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery","Regardless of what the Indonesia transaction does or doesn\u2019t look like, could you give a little sense of how you think about resuming buybacks and if there is any metrics you are looking for or if you would want to see a turn in currency for maybe even a little bit of time, if you are eager to try to get back to it or if you want to be more cautious and have some cushion on the balance sheet. What\u2019s the way that you frame that internally?","Jacek Olczak","Look, if we are looking into sort of a sustainable share buyback program with where we have to go back to what took us out of the share buyback program with currency, and that\u2019s clearly the, there\u2019s a big headwind which we get from the currency and we have made it very clear that in underlying business performance whether you look at the top-line, bottom-line et cetera and the cash flow generation, it\u2019s coming very seized, very strong, I mean the currency is essentially sending our credit metrics at the edge of our current credit rating. And therefore, we had to suspend it. So it\u2019s the currency which is the main culprit behind the absence of the share buyback program this year. So we have to see the improvement on the currency front from this side.","Michael Lavery","And then just on iQOS, you\u2019ve completed some clinical studies recently. On the national rollouts in Japan, and Italy and then also in the launch in Switzerland, is there any health claim associated with those that you are making on the product?","Jacek Olczak","Not a health claim but I think we are moving slowly into making the reduced exposure claims and this is also the result of the six short-term clinical studies which have been completed as per plan and the study results, they showed a substantial reduction in a relevant bio-micros of exposure in adult consumers who switched to iQOS. And this is compared obviously to adult consumers who continued to smoke conventional cigarette. We have the result of the studies and I believe part of our communications in these locations and other locations which we have not disclosed yet will have a component of the reduced exposure claim.","Michael Lavery","So just to clarify may be my word choice was a little offering health claim but you are making a reduced-risk or reduced exposure to claim associated with it?","Jacek Olczak","But they are two different things, reduced-risk and the reduced exposure. There\u2019s reduced exposure. Based on the knowledge which we have today, based on the results of the clinical studies et cetera, I think we are getting into positions that we can make a reduced exposure claim, reduce risk claim is, I think it\u2019s more of the story of the 2016 and depends on the regulatory framework in the countries in which we will be launching iQOS.","Michael Lavery","And then just on Australia. Could you give an update on what the pricing environment is looking like there, and if pricing from the latest round is sticking, or if there\u2019s any more promotional intensity and I guess specifically to in the last quarter\u2019s call you said it was looking like less of a drag if even maybe a drag at all this year. Is that still your view or could you give any update on, how you are thinking about that market?","Jacek Olczak","I mean we had the pricing in the Q, beginning of the Q2, I mean it somehow sticks, not maybe the talk about the perfections you would like to see but maybe life is not perfect, so we have to live with what we have. As clearly Australia is much less if at all the drag this year and that it used for us last year and I think that\u2019s also the outlook for the full year. We\u2019ll have now the August-September tax price, hopefully price change as well. And we\u2019ll see who this unfolds. You have somehow the down trading in the market. It\u2019s a little bit slightly better but I mean it\u2019s not really something which I think at this stage would put us into a jeopardy in terms of our total PMI performance for the full year. But it\u2019s vastly better than the last year. But we would like to grow the profitability in this market rather than just the comp basis be better than the last year.","Michael Lavery","And just one quick last one, in the Philippines, have you seen any impact from the launch of Chesterfield and L&M, is that becoming a meaningful part of that portfolio or is it still early?","Jacek Olczak","Well, it is still early. I think the early results are good but that\u2019s a bit of the longer runway clearly building a portfolio to reflect the current market reality dynamics et cetera. And if I can just extrapolate and I think I have a good reason to extrapolate of a Chesterfield from other international markets in which we activate, that brand should do properly its designed job in the Philippines market, Philippines markets as well. But it\u2019s too early at this stage to start looking. Sales Marlboro what is very important growth, very strong either share and the volumes and that\u2019s great because this is what, it\u2019s a good reflection of the trend of the Marlboro and obviously reaction to the lower price is up. Fortune is not doing that bad, it is quite a lot of initiatives about our second brand which we have the fortune and I think this brand also has a great future going forward. And I think Chesterfield and L&M are the brands which will maybe initially complement the portfolio and maybe one day they are going to play a more significant role in the overall portfolio.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","I just had two questions for you if I could it will follow-on to one of Michael\u2019s questions there. In relation to there is a comment about returning 100% of cash flow to investors. So I am just curious you\u2019ve had some pretty strong operating cash flow performance this year, some working capital improvements. As you -- is it a two times of EBITDA target you\u2019re kind of you are targeting here and therefore incremental cash flow if there is better working capital control is that just going towards debt reduction in the short run like we saw this quarter?","Jacek Olczak","No I mean with the credit rating which we should get it is about 2.5 right, because this is what is allowed for our credit rating if the cash if we deliver the cash flow for this year broadly with line with the last year, last year was about 6.5 slightly above the $6.5 billion that\u2019s the nice cushion to have versus the dividend commitment which currently stands at about $6.1 billion-$6.2 billion so this is how we\u2019re looking at the thing we want to have a nice cushion about a current historical dividend at the current level.","Chris Growe","One other question if I could please on the facility to make you reduced-risk products to Italy. Is that completed in the third quarter, is that going to be like fully operational? And then should we expect around Q3 to hear about more markets in which you\u2019re going to begin launching that product?","Jacek Olczak","I think the structures et cetera are completed or about to be completed and we\u2019re now moving to the installings and equipment to the machinery so I think it all goes as per plan as we said the capacity from that unit in addition to the training center which is producing the initial 5 billion capacity should be available as of 2016 so very shortly we should have an access to the incremental capacity coming from this effort.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Marshall with Barclays.","Bill Marshall","Just first I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the decision to dissolve the JV with Swedish Match. And looking at that I would imagine that overtime your emphasis around that portfolio is nascent and smokers would come down is that an ability to rotate some of those resources back towards your existing business?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean the decision the mutual decision about dissolving the joint venture with Swedish Match was based on the fact that yes there is some potential for some product in some geographies as we made the progress. But I guess by standards or our standards the progress under both components the progress was slow so we just decided that maybe it\u2019s better that both companies will just pursue the on growth opportunities and this is how we reached the decision of dissolving. Swedish Match sorry the joint venture with Swedish Match didn\u2019t have a material impact on our financial so I wouldn\u2019t count on any material reallocation of resources from Swedish Match joint venture to PMI.","Bill Marshall","And then just also kind of more of a housekeeping item, you laid out pretty detailed foreign currency impact in each of the individual currencies in the past, you\u2019ve talked a little bit about hedging particularly on the yen from a transaction perspective. I was curious if you give us an update on any currencies that you were hedged on like the yen and at what levels and for what duration?","Jacek Olczak","Well we have about slightly -- well we have above 60% for this year but I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our financial policies that we constantly look at the 12, 18 months ahead. So it\u2019s fair to assume that we already start hedging our cash flows from a yen cash flows for 2016 when we\u2019ll be giving the as was always the practiced tradition the guidance for the 2016 in February we\u2019re going to update on the number, what is our current hedge ratio for the 2016 but as I said we already looking into 2016. And yes that is essential.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.","James Bushnell","I had a couple of questions, my first one was just a follow-up on the snooze question, just interested in whether we should reach anything into peer mind\u2019s philosophy to towards these do you see it as part of the reduced risk complex and therefore well worth exploring in a number of places or is it more do you see it as a niche for a few select markets? How are you thinking about that product at the moment?","Jacek Olczak","I think from a reduced-to-reduced perspective I mean as most theories has a potential from a consumer acceptance perspective based on our experience in a few geographies when the joint venture has launched the products and then commercialized the product that is things that this is with the longer shot that we were thinking, okay this is how I would look at this.","James Bushnell","And my second question was about Poland I think volumes are down on the market level about 5% which might not sound that great, but I think it\u2019s the least bad read you have had there for a while. And I just wondered if there is anything changing there for the better and if you could just generally describe the dynamics that would be useful?","Jacek Olczak","No, Poland is one of the countries which we should still observe like in many other European Union geographies but there are improved situations with regards to illicit trade that\u2019s in Poland between East and the West, so it always is more difficult to maybe keep these things under control there, but I know that the government is focused on addressing the illicit trade that is also addresses the budgetary needs. Our volumes you rightly noticed is getting better but compared to the many other markets in the European Union I still would like to see the Polish volumes total market volumes getting better. Our share is great, I mean our brands are performing great so on a business side we are in I think a great shape in Poland total our market still I think has a there room to improve but we\u2019ll have to see when it's going to happen.","James Bushnell","And just one last question on iQOS, how is the retention rate of consumers who try iQOS progressing in Japan and Italy? And also just as a very small technical point, did I hear you right that as Marlboro cigarette priced to 8.50 in Switzerland and the HeatSticks are just below that or did I get that the wrong way around?","Jacek Olczak","Yes it is correct there is slightly price below Marlboro in Switzerland. In terms of -- with regards to the retention rate they are broadly the same as we had them in Q1, but frankly speaking we've spent more of the Q2 time in a test market to changing if you like some components of our marketing needs et cetera in preparations of the national rollout. But as I said already in the Q1 there is about a one-third of those who have really purchased iQOS device about the one-third is predominantly using the iQOS and there was a significant drop in the consumer who is sampling a inner transition.","James Bushnell","One key follow-up what is the difference in the new iQOS device versus the old ones?","Jacek Olczak","It is better look, better functionality, better feel and touch, we addressed some of the feedbacks we received from a consumer with regards to the electronics and operations of an electronics so we are being able to fit it into the new device. It's really a new better iQOS.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.","Erik Bloomquist","Your comment with respect to the contributions to European volume is interesting and is there a way you could break apart for us the contributions of the reduction in illicit and in e-vapor. So in aggregate are those worth about 1% to European Union volumes or is there pricing offsetting some of that benefit so the reduction in those is actually a bit greater?","Jacek Olczak","Look there is a pricing in Europe with ahead of the higher than the pricing we used to have in a first half of the last year, but -- so yes there is some impact on our volume on the other hand I think the underlying micros in many European markets our consumer sentiment is somehow helping us with the better elasticities that you will -- would you remember from a 2012-2013 period. I think -- and there is a not a exact mark how much is the coming from a illicit trade because you will have to go from market-to-market I think a contribution from illicit trade to the German volume presumably higher, contribution of illicit trade in some other places might be different. E-vapor product they didn't contributed that much in Germany because this was not really any sizable sort of a category but I think they are more helping France or Spain or other geographies.","One thing which we also have to remember we observed a very serious slowdown in the dynamics of the fine cut or our tobacco product which is also the outcome of a parked price and I guess also the better consumer sort of a sentiment. And you remember this is the category which used to grow say in 2012-2013 in the Europe in the churn of a 6% to 7% per annum and this volumes now are growing I think around 1% mark. So you could see the drastic change in the dynamics which obviously was pushing or pulling the consumers from the manufactured cigarettes to the fine cut product much stronger in the past than we see now. So I mean I can't give you the number how much each of this on the total -- of this drivers on a total EU basis contributed I think we\u2019ll have to go market-by-market and put some weight whereas there is more of the weight where is less of the weight which helps the total market performance. But look let's enjoy the good total market performance we know what are the drivers, we've been looking that finally one day all these things which were the significant headwind for us will unwind and will start converting into tailwinds and hope this is a more sustainable trend for this.","Erik Bloomquist","And then also related to the European vapor markets, does the imposition of the tobacco products directive does that also then create a bit of a headwind for that particular market and it is really something that probably vantages the Marlboro iQOS and HeatStick system given that you are already able to bring the product to already have a set regulatory environment where is the TPD in position will arguably make things more difficult for vapor. Is that something that you could expand on please?","Jacek Olczak","Well I mean as everything depends obviously how quickly this going to be transposed into the member state legislation and that\u2019s the process which started there are some members state which already advanced there are some members state which give before the parliamentary et cetera discussion. I mean the deadline as we know is May 2016 we will be in a position to say how individual members think what sort of a framework they create above the novel tobacco product and the e-cigarette. As you remember in a TPD there was a distinction between above fair group of both categories then we will see how that\u2019s going to play out.","Erik Bloomquist","And then lastly on the TPD with is set to Philip Morris\u2019 litigation against it. Can you give us an update on where things stand and when we may next get the next set of news fill on that what the progress is in terms of challenging TPD2?","Jacek Olczak","Well it\u2019s not much really of a development which happened, right? I mean the JC case in Ireland, was retained in Ireland which I think is a good news because it drove the other result in a clash of two similarly like cases at the ECJ level. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that the ECJ the thing is that most important part of a challenge against the directive that ECJ which will reach the European Court of Justice, sorry, will reach a conclusion before the due date for the transpose implementation of the directive which I said deadline is May 2016. That\u2019s essential.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.","Owen Bennett","And just a couple of questions please. Firstly, just on LatAm and over then the pricing leverage. And I am just wondering what was driving the very strong margins there and how sustainable these are into the rest of the year? And then secondly just on some industry volumes. And could you give an update on guidance for South Korea for the year now? And also possibly if you could comment on how industry volumes are trending in Australia especially with the recent price increases? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","So on LAC I think we have had a strong pricing coming from Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Canada. So essentially for all our key geographies there we enjoyed the strong pricing. I think it should continue. So I mean LAC last year and this year they are really performing very strongly, I think they had a good momentum. As I mentioned earlier answering other questions I mean there is a bit of a share pressure in Mexico. But on the other hand, Mexican total industry volumes are doing better. So overall into the financials we are looking pretty okay.","On South Korea, I mean it looks that our initial guidance for the market, total market for the year 20%-25% declined it is not lower to the closer to the 20%, I mean it\u2019s still significant but let\u2019s remember, you would remember how big the price increase was. Cutting overall is going better or slightly better than expected in our share is up. So I think yes I mean we have the price increase behind us. I mean let\u2019s see how this is going to unfold. But so far it unfolds pretty strongly.","And on Australia, now much really as I mentioned earlier which was, which would happen there, I mean if the prices went up there is some continue some sort of discounting. The down-trading is there may be to some extent at the lower level. Australian total market volume is obviously distorted year-on-year due to the price changes. And I think on the year-to-date basis, Australia is 0.7 actually up total market size. But it doesn\u2019t mean that the market grows. I think it\u2019s a little bit of a distortion there.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Most of my questions have been asked. So it\u2019s really a question following up a couple that have already been asked in terms of the question on EEMA pricing, you said that and it was certainly below, the pricing was below my expectations, I didn\u2019t reply to that, you said whether that\u2019ll be some mix factor. But obviously you get pricing per se excluding mix and I was just wondering if for any geographies and you had good pricing in Russia we know. So over any geographies where pricing perhaps has gone backwards or has been disappointing within EU?","Jacek Olczak","Not really. And just one thing to clarify, always when we talk about the pricing is the pricing variance and when we report the volume mix, we put the mix with the volume the\u2026","Adam Spielman","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, but yes I mean there was some negative mix for EEMA and I think largely driven by Russia. On the other hand, very encouraging and I haven\u2019t seen this result for the long time. We have zero mix impact in EU, okay. So I mean that\u2019s on the total PMI basis, I mean the mix is not that much of a major issue. Obviously we had a mix in Australia due to the down-trading, but is on a few isolated geographies.","Adam Spielman","Okay, so that\u2019s very clear. And just coming on to EU obviously the volume decline has returned to its historical or nearly to its historic average. I was just wondering if you think elasticity is about where it was before or whether we have some ways to go before we return to what it used to be.","Jacek Olczak","I think many markets have returned to what we would call the standout part of the cover called product elasticity is minus 0.3, minus 0.5, and I see more and more markets which are squarely fitting into this range, even maybe some of that mean in the lower end of this range so in minus 0.3 territory so that\u2019s good.","Adam Spielman","And just one final question following up a question the Bonnie asked clearly your market share is improving and a lot of that has to do with 2.0 but there is also the new commercial approach. And I was wondering really two questions related to that. Is it possible to say at all which is more important than the new brand architecture of a new commercial approach it is obviously a bit of both but are they equally important? And the second question related to that is, are there any important geographies where you haven\u2019t rolled out the new commercial approach yet?","Jacek Olczak","I will start with the second one, important geographies in which we are in the middle of the rollout of the commercial approach is Indonesia from the last OCI market. Coming to how much you could lump with attribute to the commercial approach and how much the 2.0 output like that, Marlboro 2.0 is the concept, it\u2019s a great concept, it\u2019s a great design, it\u2019s a great product line ups, it\u2019s a great support materials and at the end of the day you need to have advanced skills organizations to properly implement this in a market so that\u2019s your commercial approach. So this comes both together I mean it\u2019s a great idea lousy implementations, no result you have idea, great salesforce I mean who cares no impact so I think it need to have always the optimum, the right mix of more than I get we are at this stage now.","Adam Spielman","And just apart from Indonesia are there any other markets you\u2019d point to that perhaps don\u2019t currently have big OCI contributions but perhaps you could hope to gain share and that you haven\u2019t rolled it out and this would be my final question.","Jacek Olczak","From the -- no there are markets which are -- no from a significant market I guess it would be Indonesia which pops up to my mind now. I mean in many other markets we are well advance maybe there are some territories in some places but we also don\u2019t necessarily aim at the covering 100% of the any given market territory I mean it has to has a economic sense and then in writing the details cost benefit analysis and no I think Indonesia would still stay on the list I would think about Indonesia.","Operator","And that was our final question. I now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","That concludes our call today. Thank you for joining us.

Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Following the comprehensive business review that we provided during our recent Investor Day event, I will focus today on a brief summary of our 2016 full-year outlook and third-quarter results, and highlight some important developments in select geographies.","A detailed discussion of our third-quarter and year-to-date September results can be found in our earnings release. Let me begin with our full-year outlook. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2016 reported diluted EPS guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be in a range of $4.53 to $4.58.","Our guidance includes $0.35 of unfavorable currency and continues to represent a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 10.5% to 11.5% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.42 in 2015.","As a reminder, in the fourth quarter, we anticipate strong currency-neutral net revenue growth, driven primarily by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs. We also anticipate a favorable cost comparison, driven by the significant investments that we made in the fourth quarter of 2015 behind iQOS and our cigarette brand portfolio, including those related to the implementation of the EU Tobacco Products Directive.","Moving to our third-quarter results, net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively, excluding currency, reflecting favorable pricing, partly offset by negative volume\/mix, particularly in the EEMA Region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 4.0%, excluding currency.","Our favorable pricing variance of $440 million in the third quarter was driven by positive contributions from all Regions, notably EEMA.","During the quarter we announced or implemented price increases in a number of markets including those shown on this slide which should further support favorable pricing in the fourth quarter.","We recorded currency-neutral financial growth in the third quarter despite an organic cigarette shipment volume decline of 5.4%. The decrease was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in Argentina, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia, as well as lower cigarette market share, notably in North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, partly offset by market share growth in the EU Region.","Year-to-date September, our cigarette shipment volume declined by 3.9%, consistent with the year-to-date August decrease that I referenced at Investor Day. We continue to anticipate a similar decline for the full-year 2016. Our shipment volume for heated tobacco sticks reached 2.1 billion units in the third quarter, an increase of approximately 900 million units compared to the second quarter of this year. While principally driven by Japan, all iQOS launch markets contributed to this growth.","While our cigarette market share, excluding China and the U.S., declined by 0.6 points in the third quarter, due notably to North Africa, the Philippines and Russia, Marlboro's cigarette share increased by 0.3 points, driven by the EU and Asia Regions.","Let me now move to select geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4% in the third quarter, contributing to a year-to date September decrease of 0.2%. For the full-year, we continue to expect a decline of around 1%.","Our Regional cigarette share in the quarter increased by 0.4 points, driven by the continued strong performance of Marlboro, which grew share in four of the Region's top six markets by cigarette industry volume, notably Germany and Spain.","In Indonesia, we recorded sequential market share growth in the third quarter, driven by our strong performance in the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment, notably following the geographical expansion of U Bold in June. To further enhance our position, in September we launched Marlboro Filter Black kretek in 25 cities. Although it is early, we strongly believe that this offer will set the standard for the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment.","In addition, this month the Indonesian Ministry of Finance issued its 2017 excise tax regulation, which will result in a weighted-average excise tax increase of approximately 10% industry-wide. As you may recall, the weighted-average increase in 2016 was approximately 15%.","In Japan, our cigarette market share continued to stabilize, and was essentially flat compared to the third quarter of last year. This performance is notable given the impact of HeatSticks cannibalization on our cigarette share, and was supported by recent Lark and Marlboro launches.","iQOS continues to perform exceptionally well, with HeatSticks market share reaching 4.3% in the last week of September. In the third quarter, HeatSticks market share was 3.5%, an increase of 1.3 points compared to the second quarter of 2016. Importantly, these share gains have been achieved despite the limits we have placed on iQOS device sales since June. PMI's total combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks, was 27.9% in the third quarter, reflecting an increase of 2.5 points compared to the same period in 2015.","In North Africa, our third-quarter market share was 24.6%, representing a sequential increase versus the second quarter. This growth was driven by the improving performance of Marlboro in Algeria, highlighting the early success of the initiatives that we shared during Investor Day. In Russia, the Ministry of Finance submitted a proposal earlier this month to raise the specific and minimum excise tax levels for 2017 by approximately 10% above what is currently in the tax code. If the proposal is approved by the Duma and signed into law by the President, it will result, assuming full pass-on, in a total tax pass-on of approximately RUB11 per pack in 2017. The ad valorem rate of 13% remains unchanged in the proposal.","I will finish my discussion of important developments with an update on the cigarette market in Argentina. While cigarette industry volume continues to be impacted by the significant excise tax-driven price increases in May, declining 14.1% in the third quarter, adult smokers appear to be adjusting relatively quickly to the higher retail prices given the broader inflationary environment. The average monthly decline in August and September was 8%. We continue to expect a full-year cigarette industry volume decline of around 12% in 2016, and a return to its low single-digit historical decline rate during 2017 once the May 2016 tax increase has been lapped.","In conclusion, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations, and our full-year outlook remains strong. Thank you and I will be happy now to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Hi Michael.","Michael Lavery","Could you just talk about Russia for a minute? We've seen the consumer there be pretty resilient in the past; you are now calling out some share pressure from pricing ahead of competitors. Are you seeing a change in the consumer approach and are they \u2013 is there any change in their willingness to spend? Especially, if so, could you give any sort of estimate of what you think the impact of the proposed tax increase might be as well?","Jacek Olczak","I'll start with the last part. I mean that the impact as I said is about RUB11 at pass-on so it's around the same level as we had last year.","Michael Lavery","I'm sorry, could I clarify? I guess I meant with that increase do you expect any different category impact this year versus last year next year versus this year?","Jacek Olczak","No, not really. I guess it's sort of the same increase as we had last year and there was this 1 percentage point change in ad valorem, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change the dynamics between the segments. What you see in Russia on the consumer level is, yes, the consumer is looking for value. He is looking for a value. No don\u2019t question about it I mean that the premium segment, if at least judged by the share of Marlboro and especially Parliament, I mean it will hold pretty strong pretty well. There is down-trading. We observe a down-trading in the market, but more between the mid and the value segments. This is where the extra price promotions or delays in the price implementations are most frequent. We're also launching our own initiatives in this segment. So I guess also the share pressure which we have in Russia this year I think we should start being on a positive share territory in 2017.","Michael Lavery","Okay, that's helpful. And then, with respect to Japan I know it's maybe too early for you even to know but do you have a sense with the proposed indoor smoking ban, if that might apply to iQOS as well?","Jacek Olczak","Not at this level of detail that go into these discussions, but I can say that we have a number of places in Japan where the existing smoking bans have been lifted due to the fact that iQOS is not a combustible product; therefore, there is no burning, there is no smoke. So we will have to see how this is going to evolve. But in a current environment with the restrictions for smoking, et cetera, as you noted, iQOS continues to gain the penetrations in the markets, so I don't think it's going to stall the growth prospects of iQOS in Japan.","Michael Lavery","Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","My first question has to do with your volume and I guess I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the declines in the quarter. And then what gives you the confidence that you are going to still be able to hit the down around 3.9% for the full-year? Then curious to hear how that compares with your expectations for the industry volume for the full-year?","Jacek Olczak","We wouldn't change the expectations for the industry volumes, which we have shared during the investors day. I think the trends are pretty much known at this stage I think there's some improvement will continue into the 2017. Specifically to us, I think and then I start maybe with the Latin America and Argentina. I think the consumer is adjusting to the prices pretty fast, obviously to the price increase. I think this high inflationary environment somehow, somehow helps. So I think sequentially we should see some less of the pressure from the volumes coming from or the clients from Argentina, Algeria which created quite the pressure on our volumes in Marlboro including Marlboro this year, we start seeing the first signs of recovery.","It's going to take a while, but at least on the trend line we crossed the lowest point. I think already in Q4 and going into 2017 I think the pressure from Algeria and North Africa should ease Indonesia. I think the tax proposal, which came from the Ministry of Finance is manageable.","You're looking for the just tax pass-on of about say 10% versus the 15% increase which took place this year, so I think this should be helpful. In additions to the fact that I think at least judging for the last few quarters performance of our share there, I think we should have a less \u2013 in fact, all share losses in 2017 than this year and hopefully on a bit stronger market than we have had in Indonesia this year. Philippines is a completely different story because it's all questions: how much we manage our mix to the positive territory. And so far we are very successful with up-trading the markets to Marlboro, which continues to grow and it's a very strong growth. Actually, we would like to enjoy this momentum for a longer while. Even if there are some pressures on the total industry volumes coming from the lower parts of the market, I think we would be fine with this.","Pakistan, which also put quite a dent in our volume this year \u2013 it's presumably the most difficult to predict the market, because of the other forces which obviously play a role there. The contraband I think recently has reached about a third of the market, so the question is: where is the level of separation and that's it or we can expect worse than this. But again, from a financial perspective, it doesn't have that much of the impact. It doesn't have that much of a financial impact. So and Russia, the tax increase is also pretty manageable on the high side, but comparable, like we had this year.","And as I said earlier, I think Russia should also turn the corner when it comes to share declines, so next year I guess on a similar sort of the market dynamics, we should have less of a volume leakage due to the negative share performance.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay, that was really helpful and I appreciate that. Then I do have another question I guess on your other brand volume, which was down considerably in the quarter. So I was hoping you could talk a little about your strategy with some of these brands. You touched on having a greater \u2013 you remember at the investor day you touched on having a greater focus on a fewer number of brands going forward, so I guess I'm assuming this is consistent with the sharper declines we have been seeing for some of the smaller brands. And I guess I was also hoping you could confirm that although these brands are declining rapidly, they are contributing nicely to margins as they are likely promoted less.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, these brands will, in most cases, actually have a pretty low margin. The two big brands which are in our categories is to be a fortune, and very much a Jackpot in Philippines. So these are the brands which have a near zero sort of the margin territory and a lot of consumers are going from these brands to Marlboro, so we actually, through the positive mix, are improving pretty fast our financial situation there \u2013 our financial results there.","We will have also brands in Indonesia in this other category which are not necessarily on the higher end of the margin spectrum. So I would rather say brand like a Jackpot in the Philippines we would presumably treat or we are actually treating this more tactically. Fortune is a little bit different. It's a brand which we do manage and we stay focused, but we do also recognize that, at least at this stage, Marlboro due to the closer of the price gap is a more attractive proposition for the consumer. And we are absolutely fine with that. In Indonesia, many of these local brands are the brands which we do support but we also try to focus on what is less dilutive to our margins.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. And then maybe my final question, Jacek. You guys definitely walked through iQOS a lot at your investor day, but could you possibly highlight a few possible updates in the last few months on the improvements you've seen with conversion and maybe cannibalization rates?","Jacek Olczak","Conversion, I don't I have a fresher number than what we have showed at investor day. There may be a few numbers which I still remember because some of these KPIs we are tracking weekly or even more frequently. I think at Tokyo \u2013 if you might remember, the Tokyo market share of the offshore at the investor day which we shared was 7%. We now stand at 7.3%, so we continue to growth and the same is for Japan. I think a national off take share the last week or the third week of September which we have shared during the investor day. 5.2 now turns to be 5.5. You see the pretty rapid share advancement; you\u2019re talking 20 basis points, 30 basis points in a span of a couple few weeks. I have the same in Italy. When I think the share in Italy, the launch area was 60 basis points, 0.6. And now I think we lifted this last week of \u2013 sorry, first week of October I think the reading would be 0.8. Switzerland we lifted from 0.4 to 0.5. The penetration rate, the number of devices sold continues to grow. So I think in all geographies, from the top of my head, there was a continuous growth momentum very much in line of what we have shared with the investors at investor day.","Bonnie Herzog","All right, thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.","James Bushnell","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","James Bushnell","I have two questions, please. The first one is on iQOS in Japan. Clearly, you have limited the expansion because of the supply constraints you have. I just wondered if you could give us an estimate of what proportion of consumers don\u2019t have access to the product right now and whether the existing users over-index to smokers of a particular strength or taste of cigarettes. That was my first question.","Jacek Olczak","We see less and less of a proportional representation of former Marlboro smokers compared to the underlying share of Marlboros. But, clearly, the iQOS is making more or less significant inroads into the competitive combustible portfolio. Now how much really we have left unhappy consumers in Japan at this stage, I know that they are waiting release. I know that the consumers have to enroll by name of this release, but to be frank, I don\u2019t have a number at this stage. The number is somewhere, but clearly we will see how much of that backlog, if you like, of unserved consumers we will have the moment when we leave the cup which we estimate to happen somewhere in the end of the Q1 next year when we will be very comfortable with our HeatSticks supply.","But my gut feeling is we\u2019re not talking about a 5% or 10% unsatisfied demand. I think the number is much higher than that.","James Bushnell","Okay, great. Thank you. And then my second question, more of a modeling one, which is your associate and minority lines moved quite a bit since Q2. I just wondered if the numbers we are looking at in Q3 we could consider as more normalized, post some of the changes you\u2019ve had in those areas.","Jacek Olczak","I think so. There might be some movement. I think Russia should be \u2013 the Megapolis should be okay. I think maybe there\u2019s some movement in North Africa around some of the structures which we have in Egypt, but I think we should be pretty much in line of what we could expect there. There are some currency \u2013 the currency movements might have an impact on this line. As you know, we have had some exposure in Egypt on the \u2013 we have to take a dollar exposure in Egypt and there are some limitations in availability on the dollars in the country, so we might have some distortions of these lines coming from North Africa, Egypt as I mentioned.","James Bushnell","Okay, great. Understood. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Pam Kaufman","Hi, this is actually Pam Kaufman on for Matt. I just wanted to ask on pricing, it improved sequentially to about 6.5% but needs to accelerate further to reach your benchmark of 6% for the full year, and presumably would help bridge the gap to strong fourth quarter earnings growth. Can you review where you have seen incremental pricing recently that would allow you to deliver on this target for the full year?","Jacek Olczak","We should have in Q4 of this year the strongest pricing variance compared to all the quarters. We are looking in well in the north of $500 million pricing variance in the quarter and actually maybe even closer to $600 million. We should have \u2013 all-in-all in the fourth quarter we should expect above the 10% uplift on the revenue quarter on quarter. On an ex-currency basis. As I said, this \u2013 the growth in the fourth quarter, on the one hand, will be coming from the favorable comps which we have on the cost, while we still continue spending obviously more behind in iQOS, but this is more on the combustible part of the spending compared to the Q4 last year. But we also are looking into \u2013 we expect to have quite a significant uplift in the net revenue and corresponding contributions to the bottom line.","Pam Kaufman","Okay, thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Hi, Olczak.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong","So my question is on actually the mix impact, because in addition to pretty healthy pricing, it sounds like the third quarter also benefited from strong mix. So how much is this geographic mix impact? And then, when you think about the impact on iQOS, either on price mix, is there a way to kind of quantify how that would\u2019ve impacted either the price or mix in the quarter?","Jacek Olczak","The raise is doing well so obviously due to the margin, geographical margin split \u2013 on a geographical basis the mix is working in our favor. If you go into individual countries, the countries with the worst mix in the quarter were actually Indonesia and, if I recall, actually was UK. But overall \u2013 but that\u2019s it essentially. When it comes to iQOS, yes, obviously we\u2019ve already start adding the support to the revenue growth and it\u2019s going to be even stronger in Q1 of this year already.","I guess when we close the year we will start talking more about the financial impact of iQOS, at least at the revenue level, but there is already some volume impact. You know we have a capacity of about $7 billion available this year. We sold a bit less than $4 billion, so I think we\u2019ve been very transparent what one can expect from the volumes of iQOS in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s going to help lifting the revenue growth quite a bit.","Judy Hong","Okay. So if we think about it, I think iQOS added about 1% to your total volume so the revenue impact would\u2019ve been higher in the second quarter? I\u2019m so sorry, in the third quarter.","Jacek Olczak","Well, the pricing is at the Marlboro level, as you remember, plus remember in the revenue line we also have devices because we are selling the devices as well. So you have an uplift from the volume at the Marlboro price in a given geography, plus obviously the taxes and also the price at which we have \u2013 the volume at which we\u2019re selling the devices to consumers. They both contribute to the revenue.","Judy Hong","Okay. Then just, in Japan, it seems like your obviously contribution from iQOS is still very strong, but your combustibles share has also gotten better. So can you just walk through how sustainable that scenario of actually seeing combustible improvement plus the iQOS contribution? Because it sounds like maybe Japan your volume would have been up high single digit, ex inventory, if you add the iQOS volume.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, I think if you will take the full-year impact, iQOS clearly is already a significant contributor to our business there. Look, I have to actually thank you for raising these questions, because I should say how proud we are that in one year we managed to sort out the share pressure on our conventional business in Japan, despite the fact that part of that share we had to gain through the cannibalization to iQOS and, in addition, we saw successful with iQOS. I think the market share \u2013 the biggest dynamics now which you will have in a market I guess is the cannibalizations in both months between a combustible category, including own portfolio and iQOS.","But the share leakage which we have to other taste segments or new taste segments, it seems at this stage that we have very successfully addressed. So it\u2019s pretty remarkable results actually for our Japanese organization.","Judy Hong","Okay. Then just finally on currency. I know at the investor day you talked about currency in 2017 being less of a headwind versus 2016. So just if we kind of hold spot rates at these levels, is there any kind of guidance you can give? A little bit more specific guidance on 2017, particularly around the yen, just given your hedged strategy?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, I guess two questions actually. Sorry, two facts which would help maybe better predict the currency on your side of ocean. On the right is your elections impact decision about the interest rates so I am a little bit more remote from this one. I guess the number of currencies, if I look at how currencies were playing against us this year \u2013 and remember we started Q1 I guess it was at $0.19, Q2 we were $0.08 on EPS, Q3 we are $0.04. So clearly we could see that the number of currencies started to put less pressure on us.","A currency, which I singled out during the investors day, which many of us sometimes tend to forget, we had some exposures in North Africa and in particular in Egypt. So the Egyptian pound is a little bit of the worry. I don't know how they are going to relax the currency rules and how much it's going to translate into the devaluation. Other than that ruble is doing pretty okay. Euro, Japanese yen, some of you know that we hedge; we already hedged some positions in 2017, but the yen already started to contribute positively in the last few months, in the last quarter definitely. So \u2013 I \u2013 we\u2019ll have to wait until February when we will be post elections, post the Fed's decision and presumably these two big unknowns will be removed we will see how the market price the currency at that time.","Judy Hong","Okay thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning Chris.","Chris Growe","Good morning. I had just two questions, if I could. I wanted to ask first of all, as we think about iQOS in Japan in particular and just given the constraints you have to your capacity right now, should we foresee further market share expansion in that market? Or are you kind of at a limit right now on how much you can sell in that market incrementally?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we are still selling devices, not to the level where there is the demand for the device. As you know, without the device you cannot trigger the consumption of HeatSticks. But we somehow manage the growth or limiting the growth to the corresponding growth in the available production volume which we have. The capacity which we have, 7 billion, this year is not the 7 billion divided by 12 in equal installment per month. It's very much in adding back. So the peak of this annualized capacity is going to be in December this year. So, yes, we can add some devices, but we are not satisfying the whole demand for the devices from the consumers. And this demand is a default is newcomers \u2013 people who want to leave the combustible category, quit smoking and they move to iQOS, to heat not burn \u2013 but also existing consumers who want now a second device, et cetera, because they, for the convenience, whatever other purposes, they want to have more devices. By the way we are selling more devices week after week, quarter after quarter but not the extent or the demand is for the devices in the market.","Chris Growe","Okay. Then my second question, just in relation to volumes overall, there was a lot of timing differentials in certain markets this year. Did overall the timing differential lead to a plus or a minus for volume this quarter? Do you have a good sense of what volume would have been?","Jacek Olczak","I don't think a quarter is actually a good way of looking at things. There's always distortions. If I take nine months this year, year to date, I think the total distortion, if I remember, were in the tune of 200 million units by total volume. It's a lot of things which will net of over the period time, the timing of the shipments, the inventories, et cetera.","If I take Q3 on the year-to-date basis versus Q3 year-to-date basis last year I think the total due to the shipment, timing of the shipments inventories would be about 200 million units.","Chris Growe","Units, okay. If I could add just one quick one, in terms of the next nine or 10 markets where you have to announce for the launch of iQOS, should we expect that to come soon or would that be a separate announcement or? Certainly by the end of the year you indicated you wanted to be in 20 markets, correct?","Jacek Olczak","Yes","Chris Growe","Okay","Jacek Olczak","But we\u2019ve added recently Denmark. I think we added \u2013 we're about adding Holland, Canada I think we talked about this I think at investors day. It's getting dynamics to this point that I think we will be more giving of updates on a quarterly basis, what we have done in a quarter, than proactively start talking where we go because it's becoming a little bit like a map of United Nations.","Chris Growe","Right. Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you for taking my question.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Adam.","Adam Spielman","I just want to be a little bit \u2013 make sure that I have understood what's happening in the fourth quarter correctly. If I've understood it correctly, you said, first of all, there will be pricing variance of close to $600 million and then on top of that there will be benefits from reduced costs, firstly, relating to the European Tobacco Products Directive and, secondly, less spending on reduced-risk products. And then, finally \u2013 and I'm just checking that I heard you correctly \u2013 your spending on conventional products will not change. Is that correct? In the fourth quarter versus last year's fourth quarter?","Jacek Olczak","You are almost correct, but not fully correct. The pricing variance will be up to the $600 million \u2013 $500 million plus up to $600 million you\u2019ll have about $500 million or so in the comps. Not necessarily it means that the costs will be get down, but in the comps, Q4 on Q4, you will have in debt $500 million higher spending on iQOS, or RRPs, but less spending in that quarter on combustibles. But I think, for modeling purposes, I would just think you all have uplift in revenue through the price and support of the volume coming from either some improved trends, but very much for the iQOS and better comps on the cost Q4 on Q4.","Adam Spielman","Can you just \u2013 less spent on combustibles; is there any way of quantifying that, sort of percentage change?","Jacek Olczak","No, but look, we have taken some costs ahead of the tobacco product directive implementation \u2013 there were some related costs in a number of markets in the EU. We accelerated that spending in Q4 2015 and most of these initiatives have already taken place. And in many countries the tobacco product directive now is in the physical product implementations in the shops of all infrastructure retooling of machines and all the other associated costs that have already been incurred. Therefore, optically it looks like we have less spending on combustibles in Q4, but this is in comparison to Q4 last year.","Adam Spielman","Okay, thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Russo & Gardner.","Thomas Russo","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Tom.","Thomas Russo","Hi, can you just remind us what the year-end likely capacity will be for iQOS stick productions end of 2016, end of 2017, and end of 2018? If you can give some measure of those. And did you say that the production lift that we are looking at present will kick in by the end of January of next year? And if so, when do you think you release the restrictions on device sales in Japan and other markets if we're up and running by the end of January?","Jacek Olczak","I think the release on the cap on devices will happen towards the end of Q1 next year \u2013 of 2017. Capacity is always two numbers to \u2013 it's a pretty dynamic situation the two numbers to remember. We have available total capacity this year over 7 billion, but in December annualized, our capacity times 12, is 15 billion.","Thomas Russo","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","From December that wants to figure it out, what is my underlying capacity for the month of January, for example? The first month after December it's 15 divided by 12. And then we adding 15 January, February and every month after that, so we will have a commercial capacity for the full year of 2017 of 32 billion, hopefully a bit more than 32 billion, and we will close 2017, i.e., December with 50 billion capacity. If you take January 2018, my monthly capacity is 50 divided by 12.","Thomas Russo","Perfect.","Jacek Olczak","But if you remember then will be in the mode that we can add 4 billion capacity per month, if needed, if we start committing the capacity in the early part of 2017.","Thomas Russo","Yes, thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Thomas Russo","Perfect.","Operator","There appear to be no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","That concludes our call for today. Thank you for joining us.

And welcome to the Philip Morris International Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 third quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App.","A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","Additionally, following the comprehensive business review that we provided at our recent Investor Day, today we will summarize our 2018 full-year outlook and third quarter results, as well as our performance in select geographies. For reference, the slides and transcripts for the Investor Day presentations are available on our website and our IR App.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?","Martin King","Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. As announced this morning, we are reaffirming our 2018 reported diluted earnings per share guidance, at prevailing exchange rates, to be in a range of $4.97 to $5.02.","Our guidance includes $0.12 of unfavorable currency and represents a growth rate, excluding currency of approximately 8% to 9% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017. Our guidance continues to reflect the full-year assumptions shown on this slide and detailed in today's press release.","Importantly, this includes: PMI heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 41 billion to 42 billion units, reflecting a net anticipated distributor inventory reduction of approximately 3 billion units; and PMI heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume of 44 billion to 45 billion units.","Moving to our third quarter results, total shipment volume decreased by 2.1%, due mainly to the impact of distributor inventory movements, notably related to heated tobacco units in Japan. Excluding inventory movements, total shipment volume increased by 1.1%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume in the EU, Japan, Korea, the Middle East and Africa region and Russia as well as higher cigarette volume in select markets, notably Indonesia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Thailand and Turkey.","September year-to-date, total shipment volume declined by 1.2%, but increased by 0.3% excluding inventory movements.","Given the impact of distributor heated tobacco unit inventory movements on our third quarter 2018 results, let me take a moment to put this into perspective vis-\u00e0-vis the 3 billion unit full-year distributor inventory reduction assumption that we previously communicated.","As seen on this chart, the full-year reduction is driven by Japan and concentrated in the third quarter, with a decrease of 3.7 billion units. By comparison, there was an inventory increase in the third quarter of 2017 of 3.2 billion units, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.9 billion units.","For the fourth quarter this year, we anticipate a 0.5 billion unit inventory increase. This compares to an inventory increase of 7.3 billion units in the fourth quarter of 2017, resulting in a negative total heated tobacco unit inventory variance of 6.8 billion units.","Importantly, heated tobacco unit inventories have been right-sized, and we are poised for future growth.","Third quarter net revenues increased by 3.3%, excluding currency, driven by strong pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio, partly offset by the impact of the heated tobacco unit inventory adjustment that I just noted, as well as unfavorable combustible tobacco volume\/mix.","Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter came in slightly above the approximately 2% growth expectation that we provided during Investor Day. As this difference mainly reflects timing between the third and fourth quarters, we are maintaining our full-year net revenue growth assumption of approximately 3%, excluding currency.","Given our September year-to-date growth of 6.5%, this implies a decline in the fourth quarter of approximately 5%, largely reflecting the difficult comparison with the nearly 19% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Adjusted operating income increased by 7.6%, excluding currency, reflecting the price-driven growth in net revenues, the favorable margin impact of lower IQOS device sales, as well as lower manufacturing and marketing costs for combustible products, partly offset by incremental RRP investments across IQOS launch markets.","Adjusted operating income margin increased by 1.8 points, excluding currency.","Our reported diluted EPS of $1.44 increased by 13.4% in the quarter, driven by favorable business performance, and also benefiting from the lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense compared to the third quarter of 2017.","Excluding currency, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 20.5%. Demonstrating our favorable business momentum, total PMI international market share, excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.5 points in the third quarter and by 0.6 points September year-to-date.","The growth for both periods was driven by higher share for heated tobacco products, with the lower cigarette shares reflecting the impact of adult smoker out-switching to our heated tobacco brands. Indeed, our cigarette shares within the cigarette category alone were stable.","As discussed in detail by our Chief Operating Officer, Jacek Olczak, during Investor Day, our combustible tobacco portfolio continues to be supported by robust fundamentals. This is evidenced by our third quarter combustible pricing variance of approximately 8%, driven notably by the EU Region, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia.","Furthermore, our results reflect favorable cigarette share and\/or volume trends across a range of key markets. For example, the decline in cigarette industry volume in Saudi Arabia moderated considerably in the quarter, reflecting the lapping of the June 2017 excise tax implementation.","Importantly, our market share increased by 6.1 points versus the third quarter of 2017, driven by Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, and was up by 1.6 points sequentially.","In Turkey, strong cigarette industry volume growth continued in the quarter, supported by the lower prevalence of illicit trade. In addition, although our August quarter-to-date share declined slightly, share for Marlboro increased by 1.3 points.","And in the Philippines, both Marlboro and Fortune drove total cigarette market share growth of 1.2 points in the quarter. Marlboro's performance reflects the brand's strong equity in the market, while Fortune is benefiting from narrowed price gaps with lower-priced brands.","Turning to the performance of IQOS, we are pleased with the growth in the total user base, which we believe serves as a leading indicator for market share. Indeed, the positive sequential share performance for our heated tobacco brands continued in the quarter, reaching 1.7% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, excluding China and the U.S.","In Japan, our largest IQOS market, we recorded stable quarterly HeatSticks share on a sequential basis. This is encouraging, given that we expect the range of initiatives that we have outlined previously including the upcoming launch of IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 Multi to only have a meaningful impact on share beginning in 2019.","Please note that third quarter in-market sales for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units, industry-wide benefited from trade and consumer inventory movements in advance of the October 1st price increases.","In Korea, in-market sales volume for HEETS in the quarter was stable on a sequential basis at 1.4 billion units. Sequential share for HEETS declined, however, partly reflecting the impact of cigarette in-market sales volume seasonality.","The sequential quarterly share trend for HEETS also reflects the impact of misleading comments by the KFDA earlier this year regarding the quote tar generated by IQOS, as well as competitive churn associated with the increased distribution coverage of competitors' products.","As Jacek explained at Investor Day, the KFDA's comments have not really been an issue with regard to IQOS users that have already fully made the switch from cigarettes, and thus have discovered the various product attributes for themselves. Instead, the comments have been impacting those who are new to IQOS or were otherwise planning to enter the heated tobacco category.","We remain focused on properly educating current IQOS users and adult smokers interested in the heated tobacco category on the differences between tobacco heating and combustion. We are committed to ensuring that these smokers receive accurate information to guide their choices.","In addition, the upcoming global launch of IQOS 3 devices, which includes Korea, should reinforce IQOS's status as the preeminent heated tobacco brand in the market.","In the EU region, the steady sequential growth of HEETS continued in the quarter, with share reaching 1.2% and reflecting further growth in the IQOS user base. It is also worth highlighting that our quarterly share for HEETS increased in all IQOS markets in the region compared to the third quarter of 2017.","Finally, we are particularly encouraged by the strong performance of IQOS in Russia. In the third quarter, share for HEETS reached 1.1% nationally, although our focus is currently on key cities comprising approximately 20% of the total cigarette market.","Our disciplined approach to geographic and channel expansion allows us to ensure continued improvement in IQOS conversion rates and consumer experience.","To conclude, we delivered solid currency-neutral results in the third quarter, driven by strong pricing for our combustible product portfolio and benefiting at the EPS level from a lower effective income tax rate and lower interest expense.","Our 2018 business outlook remains intact, supported by robust fundamentals for combustible products and increasingly broad-based IQOS growth across geographies. Consequently, we are reaffirming our 2018 reported diluted EPS guidance, which continues to represent a growth rate of approximately 8% to 9%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.72 in 2017.","Thank you. I am now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much. So, I have two questions. The simpler question is on FFA [ph]. This clearly did much better than I was expecting and I suspect it's partly in Philippines, but a large chunk is Indonesia. I was wondering whether you think that good performance there is likely to continue into 2019 or whether you think it is a sort of short term lift if you like.","That's my first question. I will come on to the second later.","Martin King","Okay. Yes, the Philippines and Indonesia are both performing well. Philippines, Marlboro has been on a multi-year share growth trajectory that continues as the pricing in the market at the low-end has moved up and it is the preeminent brand in the market so it continues to grow its share which is helping lift the overall share.","More recently the positive has been also that Fortune has started to benefit from the price gaps as well and so its growth has been very good up from a share point of view and obviously with the price gaps closing and the trading to Marlboro is from a share perspective in Fortune that's helped the profitability in the market.","As far as we can see going forward, I think the Philippines will continue to be a good story with the single tier tax there and the ability of our brands to continue to do very well. For Indonesia, the volume has been better than more recent times as the market has stabilized. The total market size has stabilized. We're looking probably for the full year for it to be very slightly down but it's very close now to being flat versus before in previous couple years it's been down 1%, 2% to 3%. So that's a positive trend.","We're doing very well in Indonesia with a couple of brands, we introduced in the last 12 to 18 months and that is the Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild and then also with the Marlboro Filter Black Kretek they both gained share very nicely and they continue to do so.","The challenge for us in Indonesia is with down-trading as A Mild has moved through the 20,000 per pack, rupiah per pack price point it has lost some share. Over time of course other brands will move to that price point and it should recover, but that's still going to take a bit longer to do.","So, I think Indonesia is on a good stable platform, shares stable to slightly up and it's been that way now for a good period of time. Obviously, we would like to see the share grow. We'd like to see A Mild start to do better and I think that's just going to take some time as the pricing moves through the market. As you know in Indonesia you have lots of frequent price increases.","So, yes very good news in that region.","Adam Spielman","Okay. So perhaps, a more significant question is about your guidance. Given your substantial beats not only of the sales growth, but also on EBIT I suppose I simply didn't understand how your EPS can be as low as you say. In other words, I estimate that you are sort of implying of EPS is that it has to be down something like 11% to 15% for 4Q to make your guidance.","On particularly the shipping effects in fact and I want to share the shipping effects on IQOS are fundamentally almost the same in 3Q and 4Q. I didn't understand given how good EPS was this quarter why we should think it's going to be down double-digit next quarter?","Martin King","Okay. So let's start at the revenue line and the story there is really the comparison with a very high increasing Q4 of last year versus what's happening in Q4 this year. Actually sequentially from Q3 to Q4 if you do the math on the revenues to be down about 5% for the quarter versus last year and to be up 3% for the full year you end up with revenues approximately the same in the fourth quarter is what we're seeing in the third quarter.","So sequentially it's not really the issue. On the other hand when you compare Q4 to last year, you have several things going on most of which relate to Japan and that is you have the 7 billion almost impact on the inventory comparison year-over-year since we were building last year inventory whereas this year the inventory is relatively flat.","So that right there is a pretty significant comparison issue. We also paid back in Q4 in Japan the volume related to this recent pricing that occurred since retail and consumers loaded in the end of Q3 and so you will pay that back in Q4 that's probably around 1.5 billion sticks between conventional and heated tobacco units that's just approximate.","And then the other piece is the difference in device sales from last year to this year. Last year, we were bringing on the additional supplier and adding more volume into the market as we were getting ready to lift the cap in the end of January of this year. Whereas this year, we're launching 3, and 3 Multi however we have sufficient inventory of 2.4 plus.","So, the comparison year-over-year on devices is also another piece of that. If you talk about the rest of the business, the revenues are actually up about the same in Q4 of this year or will be we anticipate Q4 this year versus Q4 last year around 5%. But the Japan effects are very significant when you add those impacts up.","The other piece when you take it down to the EPS level is the cost pattern we're still on track with the cost. The spending increases that we mentioned before around $600 million incremental on RRP, but a bigger piece of it comes in the fourth quarter, so we are stepping up the spending timing in the fourth quarter overall it's still more of less the same.","And that's partly behind the 3 and 3 Multi launch around the world as well as other activities around RRP where we are rolling out some of the efficiencies and improvements that we've been preparing all year.","So it's all baked in to the guidance, the 8% to 9% takes into account these issues as well as the pricing and everything else.","Adam Spielman","So, to summarize and to make sure I got to understand sequentially. So, thinking about it because I think easy because you've got a 7 billion G load in effect in both quarters 3Q and 4Q, you expect roughly. Sequentially, when all is said and done sales will be roughly the same but EPS is going to go down sharply because you are investing more behind the version 3 device.","I mean to me that sounds like the key difference between Q3 and Q4 when you come to the cost line if sales is going to be the same roughly.","Martin King","Yes. I mean revenue is more of less the same. I mean obviously there are other impacts in there like as I mentioned the timing on the timing on the pricing for Japan has an impact or other movement around the world between Q3, Q4 et cetera. But overall, I think it's all baked in.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Martin, just the first question is on the IQOS next gen 3 and the multi launch in the fourth quarter. So, it sounds like in Korea they are announcing a launch next week. I'm just wondering from a timing perspective if you can just remind us sort of the phasing of the launch by just the market is Japan going first and then Japan.","Sorry, is Korea going first and then Japan or kind of thinking about the timing around that is my first question.","Martin King","Yes, it will become more clear in the next short period of time. But essentially Japan, Korea are on the same timeline and we're getting ready for having a really successful introduction because we think these devices are a step forward and will help cement our already good position as the premium RRP brand in both those markets.","Judy Hong","Got it. And then in Japan for the inventory loading ahead of the price increases I think you called out 1.5 billion in total in the third quarter. I'm just wondering if you can break that a little bit or just combustible versus the HeatSticks?","And then I know it's early in the days, but kind of what are you seeing in terms of the consumer acceptance to those pricing and the volume elasticity around that?","Martin King","Well okay. First of all the prices have only been there very very short period of time. So it's too early to really see any patterns in how consumers are reacting. In Japan, just let me plan out to make sure people understand what I'm referring to is retail stores and consumers buying ahead of the price increase which occurred in the third quarter.","It doesn't have to do anything with our own shipments to distributors et cetera. This is consumers, however in the fourth quarter obviously consumers and retailers would reverse that and so you could anticipate lower sales. As far as the exact amount, it's difficult to estimate a precise amount. I was giving a round number on the revenue just to give a sense for it.","We think heated tobacco units in Japan for the quarter, we were flat to maybe slightly up if you exclude the inventory or the impact of the pricing. But that's just an estimate, right? So you figured it was at 7.5 billion in there, we figured it's around maybe 7.8 billion, 7.9 billion somewhere in that range and whereas cigarettes were around 7.6 billion or so. And that's just a rough estimate Judy.","You don't really know until you see how it flows out into the consumers and how the prices are accepted and it's too early to really see that yet.","Judy Hong","Got it, okay. And then, this is my last question just in terms of Russia. So, nice to see continued price improvement in that market. Just give us an update in terms of competitively what you're seeing in the marketplace and then sort of the sustainability of this more stable pricing environment in your build?","Martin King","Yes. I mean there is really no new news. The pricing continues to roll through pretty much as we've been talking throughout the year. We still see some down trading from the mid-priced brand like our Bond Street to lower price. We actually see our premium Parliament et cetera holding up pretty well. But the pricing environment is more of less what we communicated in previous quarters which means it's being pushed through.","There are certain times when we see higher levels of inventory being used in order to delay the timing between announcing pricing versus when consumers actually get it. But there is really no new news on that front.","Judy Hong","Got it, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co.","Vivien Azer","So, my first question is on the EU and the margin improvement continued to be quite strong on the heels of a good second quarter [indiscernible] as well. Anything to call out there in terms of geographic mix, obviously the pricing has been a bit better but anything else to call out?","Martin King","Right, I think Germany has been a bring spot with the performance of the brand. Marlboro and we've seen some good results there. I mean overall across the EU the bigger story is about the success on the heated tobacco units and IQOS.","We're seeing very nice momentum across all the markets with growth and you see it in the number of users which is really the key metric to keep looking at because that for us is what tells us that we're converting smokers and locking in a better future as far as having higher margins and higher benefits for shareholders from the consumers.","So, it is on a very good trajectory. But most of it, the most exciting part is that the success of the heated tobacco unit.","Vivien Azer","Terrific! That's certainly encouraging to hear.","My next question is on Saudi Arabia. Clearly we understand the volume pressure from the excise taxes and your market share has clearly looked quite good. But there have been press reports that Saudi is looking to implement plain packaging. Any update from that and how are you thinking about the potential impact to your business? Thanks.","Martin King","No. We don't have any new news on that. I mean obviously we're happy to be lapping the big implementation of excise and that helps us as far as our comps moving forward, but we don't really have any other additional news in Saudi.","Vivien Azer","Fair enough. My last question please. Have you had any new engagement with the FDA on your IQOS application? Thanks.","Martin King","We're in the same place we were at Investor Day, which is we are hopeful that we would hear something on the PMTA by the end of this year. But it's really in the hands of the FDA and we don't have anything more to add, I think we covered it pretty well at Investor Day and there is really nothing new on that front either.","Vivien Azer","Excellent! Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Just looking at the heated tobacco and the revenues you report for that by segment along with the HeatSticks volumes. I know you don't give the number of devices, which is a part of that. But just crudely calculating the revenue per stick, it looks like Russia or Eastern Europe has gone up considerably from last year and Middle East Africa duty free and East Asia are down a bit.","Can you just help us understand is device mix a big part of that have you had any lower pricing that is driven it? Have you seen the discount on the IQOS device in Japan that you made sort of basically permanent be a driver of that?","How do we think about just some of the portfolio mix within the IQOS platform?","Martin King","Well, yes. I mean Russia is doing very well and continues to grow very nicely at a stepped up pace from what it was some time ago. Duty free is continuing to show good growth this year. I think you see the stories for Japan and for Korea in the graphs that we showed during the presentation, the volume is stable to slightly up in Japan if you strip out the effects of the pricing.","In Korea it's stable. The number of devices sold is pretty much in line, it's lower than it was before partly with regard to Japan of course it was that we had sold it to our distributor there and we've now been working on for those inventories as opposed to seeing new additional shipments which would impact revenue.","They've been reduced to bring that inventory back into line just as we communicated we would do and going forward you're going to see the 3 and 3 Multi coming in. Bur as it's a new product and we're ramping up production, the year-over-year comparison on devices will be negative for Japan compared to Q4 last year. But other than that I think you really get the effects of the growth that was offset by the inventory changes that we communicated for Japan.","Michael Lavery","Well, and so I realized you have all the data yourself. So you may not have it back of the envelope, the way like this you would even look at it. But for example in Eastern Europe the price per stick, the total IQOS revenues per HeatStick were up over 25% would that suggest a greater skew to devices and if so is that a potentially good leading indicator of increasing adoption with the stick sales to follow?","Martin King","I'm not sure I follow that. Obviously, when we sold devices it's flattering the revenue and until you have a consumer with the device, you don't get the stick sale, so there is a lag. So, as you are opening a new market you might see the revenues from the devices be a heavier proportion until you've converted smokers to it and then they start to purchase and repurchase the HeatSticks.","So there is often a period of time where, when we look at a metric like HeatSticks per device sold in a newer market that would be relatively low and then it would steam as you convert more users. So, some of these metrics can be affected by either very rapid growth like what's happening in Russia where we are converting a lot of people and selling devices. But then the HeatSticks lag there.","So it depends on where the market is as far as whether it's stable from the point of view or whether it's adding users at a very fast pace versus a more mature state where it's adding users but maybe not as quickly that might have something to do with some of your back of the envelope calculations but I am not sure I can really help you with that.","Michael Lavery","No, it's very helpful. That's exactly the way it looks, so that's great color, just one more on HeatSticks and pricing. Can you just give us some of your thinking as the business now is getting to be two or more years old in many markets as you are taking regular price increases on cigarettes?","Are you applying those to HeatSticks as well, I know typically you have some modest discounts where others have small price grant relative to say Marlboro for example. But when you are taking cigarette price increases do HeatSticks tend to benefit from that as well?","Martin King","Well, the best example is what we are doing in Japan right now. So, we increased the price on Marlboro HeatSticks from \u00a5470 to \u00a5500 whereas we increased \u2013 from \u00a5460 to \u00a5500 on the Marlboro heated tobacco units whereas the Marlboro cigarettes went from \u00a5470 to \u00a5510.","So the increase was actually the same but we kept a small differential in the price. So, I think it's going to depend on each market. Obviously we want our heated tobacco units to be premium products and we don't want to have too big a gap, the other piece that influence it is how big is the tax benefit in each country and making sure at least pass some of that tax benefit toward the consumers.","So in general, I think over the long haul you will see the pricing from heated tobacco units come but it will depend on the situation in the market with regard to taxes and with regard to where we are as far as establishing the category and establishing the brand.","Japan is the most mature of all and you see the pricing that occurred there recently which kept gaps but moved with cigarettes.","Michael Lavery","That's very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I have a question on your total operating margin. It expanded nicely despite higher spending and was probably driven by your lower IQOS device sales in the quarter. So, I am wondering as you ramp your new device sales in Q4 how much of a negative impact will this have on your margins?","And then actually maybe going back to an earlier question on your guidance can you just explain why your EPS growth in Q4 won't be higher?","And then as we think about next year and you continue to build or ramp your new device sales. Just trying to get a sense of the impact this might have going forward on your margin?","Martin King","Yes, so I think you are right to look at device sales is having an impact on the margin and we actually called it out in previous quarters when we were shipping ahead of demand and had higher device sales as a percentage of net revenues for RRP.","I mean we've given the sort of rule of thumb it's around 25%, but like in the first quarter it was quite high. It was like 36% and that dragged our margins a lot. Now you are seeing in Q3 it was lower, because we were drawing down inventories above 14%. So you see the benefit now swinging the other way when you compare.","So, over time I think it works out to be around 25% of RRP's. But it's going to be variable depending on the timing of either inventory adjustments or of course launching additional devices. Now 3 and 3 Multi coming in, now in the fourth quarter, we're obviously ramping up supply as well.","So, it's not as though we can ship as many as we would like. We have to live within what can be manufactured. So, I don't know that you will see such a huge surge of it because of the fact that you have to get it distributed. You have to get it in consumers' hands. You have to explain it. Plus you have to be able to manufacture it.","So, going forward I think the 25% waiting it probably the best estimate, but it's going to vary.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. No, that's helpful. And then on the same line what do you think about next year and we should expect these the new device sales to continue to sort of build especially in Q1 and probably Q2 and then depending on the demand throughout the year. So, maybe it's not so front end loaded, I'm just trying to get a sense of the phasing also as we look forward into 2019.","Martin King","Yes, I am not sure I can help you with much more than what I have just said. Keep in mind though we will also continue to sell the 2.4 plus device in the market and we will use both as important ways to both reach more price sensitive consumers or newer consumers will may not be willing to invest as much in the device with 2.4 plus, but use the 3 and 3 multi as a more premium offering and giving consumers that consecutive experience option with the 3 Multi that's very important.","I think it will help us a lot in Japan and Korea especially, but also in other markets. So they both have a role to play going forward and part of us is going to depend on how fast we convert consumers because obviously as we ramp up our efforts and continue to get better at reaching consumers and converting consumers you need the devices to go with that.","Bonnie Herzog","And that is actually is a little bit of on the lines of my next question which was on the spending behind IQOS. You mentioned I think that Q4 spending might be a little bit higher again as you rollout these new devices. But just wanted to confirm that your total spending for the year in terms of incremental spend will still be around that $600 million range.","And then just want to get a sense as we look forward, how should we think about any increased levels of spending you might need to do again you timed increase conversion will it be the same level next year or do you need to ramp that further?","Martin King","The $600 million that we communicated early in the year is intact. We're on track for that. I was referring to the phasing of it where it's a bit heavier in the fourth quarter to support the 3 and 3 Multi launch but also some other initiatives. So it's more waiting within the quarters that I was referring to.","The total incremental spend net of CC the allocations is intact at about $600 million. As far as next year, I'll just reiterate what we said before which is that we expect that a chunk of that investment that we've made this year will support higher volumes going forward in next year.","In other words it won't need to be scaled with higher volumes and spread, whereas there will be another portion which we will need to continue to increase as we reach more consumers and as we move forward in additional geography. So it will be a mix.","We are also as we communicated at Investor Day working hard at reallocating our spending and getting spending efficiencies out of our current business as part of our transformation that will be through various efforts including the normal operations activities around productivity and as SKU rationalization supply chain.","But also a new initiative around obese measuring methodology to work hard on scrubbing our spending and making sure we are putting it to the great best use. Some of which would be invested in improving revenue growth and helping to fund these investments that we need to make and some of which helps us with our step in our growth targets where we are growing from at least 5% compound annual growth rate on revenue stepping up to be at least 8% compound annual growth rate ex-currency both of them for the earnings per share.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's helpful and then maybe just one final question from me if I may. Just in terms of IQOS and the progression in different markets. You talked about the success you are having and maybe you could highlight again one of two markets that you are really excited about in terms of what you are seeing and where couple of more markets could really take off and then on the flipside of what are there any markets right now that are possibly presenting challenges or maybe similar in terms of complexity to what you're experienced in Japan where you are at now in that market or possibly that get you passed.","That would help. Just a couple markets you are super excited and then maybe a couple that you are little bit concerned about. Thanks.","Martin King","Well, first of all we have broad geographic success with this product. It's doing well all across the EU, it's doing well across many many many markets. So, it's hard to pick up just one or two to say or particularly interesting Russia is the one that we've tried and we've seen very positive momentum there.","We've implemented a lot of tools and approaches that we intend to spread the other markets later in Russia. As something of our pilot or testing ground and we've seen excellent success and excellent execution by the team in Russia around all sort of tools that would regard a digital and other approaches that we will continue to roll out in other markets as well.","I mean I think the big challenge as we've talked about quite extensively being overcoming in Korea this issue around misunderstanding caused by the statement that were made and trying to reach consumers and make sure they get the accurate message about what this product does to you.","And then of course in Japan where we have very good initiatives coming now very soon in the fourth quarter not just the 3 and 3 Multi launch but also the HEETS launch at the mainstream prince of \u00a5470 and that will help us in the more price sensitive areas as well we'll start with it and of course the messaging the approach to the consumer base improving our execution across the whole line we've been working very very hard on that across all the markets.","That are actually focusing on Japan and Korea and we hope to see the benefits from these initiatives really start to show up essentially in 2019.","Bonnie Herzog","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, just had a couple of questions for you. I want to ask within the combustible business, if you could speak to like the mix performance. Just thinking about the context of having some conversions of discount brands around the world to global brand and just comp mix overall is performing to the mix of country and product mix in that question.","Just curious if you can comment on it?","Martin King","Yes, we have been working at consolidating brands into the global brands for efficiency regions. Because you can support essentially a campaign and an approach walk in the field [indiscernible] for only a restricted number or smaller number of global brands.","So moving some of the local brands, a great example is what we did in Russia moving some brands in the Philip Morris and being able to support it better and you see Philip Morris growing in Russia. That's for efficiency reasons, but also for consumer reasons, it gives consumers a move established brand to migrate toward.","I mean obviously there are some challenges around mix in certain countries, I mentioned Indonesia earlier where you have certain price point we are moving through and you have some down trading that occurs over time that can flow the other way depends on which brands are going through which price point.","But we are focused on getting more efficient and working on consolidating our brands around the world.","Chris Growe","Just to reiterate is that moving to some of those global brands from more local brands is that a sector mix is that a positive or a negative?","Martin King","Well, so far as you can over time establish a stronger brand and then have it move up a bit in pricing it can be more helpful. A lot of the smaller local brands tend to be at lower price points, so over time you can establish a Chesterfield or a Philip Morris in the market, you can move it up off the bottom of the pricing and get it delivering a bit more benefit from the mix perspective.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you. And then I'm curious if you can say how many market do you expect for IQOS to be in for the year?","Is that kind of continuing to increase overall into 43 before 42, 43 before?","Martin King","Right now we have lots of room to grow within the markets where we are already launched. In almost all the markets except for a handful, we still are not completely national we're focused more on bigger cities and on areas that are good place to start, where we have opportunities to spread geographically.","A good example of that is Russia, where we've seen tremendous success in the cities where we've launched. But it's only representing 20% of the volume. So nationwide we're a little over 1% market share, 1.1% but obviously in the focused areas where we launched we're much higher than that.","So, we have plenty of room to grow in a lot of the markets where we've already launched. Now we do periodically add additional markets as it makes sense. Sometimes that's because of the tax or the regulatory environment has finally gotten to where it supports this product and we want to lock it in and go ahead and launch and get things going there that's some cases.","In other cases there are just markets we want to get going with because we think they show great promise. Now over the three year period a longer period we would obviously have more markets in that. I'm talking about more of the shorter term period.","So you'll see the markets probably creep up a bit in the next six to 12 months, but I don't think we'll be adding a large number of markets in that time period and as you go further out of course we would like to get to some of the other big market that we haven't addressed yet.","Chris Growe","I had just one quick follow-up which is on the Investor Day you showed a chart of an increase in shipments \u2013 increase in the sales of devices in July and August in Japan. That was a big of resurgence there of device sales. Is that, and we saw a little bit of an increase at least sequentially from the day you gave at the Investor Day in Japan in HeatStick market share.","Should we expect those devices to contribute to HeatStick volume in Japan? Do we see some of that already in if you will in September for the quarter and is that starting to increase a bit as you sell more devices there?","Martin King","Well, obviously we're focused on converting smokers into the category. In Japan the category is still growing, we've added the whole heat-not-burn categories added well over a million new consumers over the course of the year and we're the biggest player in that. We're getting very good proportion of that.","So you need devices to continue to do that. We are selling devices to consumers as we convert them and a nice click in Japan. You also will have replacement devices particularly in market like Japan it's already been out there for a couple of year.","You have consumers that want to replace their device, they want a second device. When it comes to 3 and 3 Multi, we could very well see consumers buy this as an additional device not just for new consumers, we would expect quite a few of the existing consumers to be interested in the Multi for example.","So, yes we see good trend on device sales since we communicated I think in May sort of the lower point. We've seen some nice recovery since then, although some of that is holders as well, because we've been selling holders as well as the complete device. And so, I think we see a pretty good base in trend for optimism in Japan as far as the volume and share is stable, it's not showing a big uptick.","But we do expect these programs in the fourth quarter to start having the intended effect and our growth to be more occurring in 2019, we're very optimistic about what's coming in Japan.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","I just wanted to follow-up a little bit more on Japan and was hoping you can elaborate on the competitive dynamics there in heat-not-burn given some recent competitor product introductions over the last several months and competitors distribution expansion efforts over the last quarter?","Martin King","Yes. It's nothing really new. We've been talking about the competitors that have expanded their distribution and they've obviously benefitted from that. There were some supply constraints especially on the part of Japan tobacco earlier in the year.","So they have been gradually able to expand over the course of the year. We've shown before the places where the competitors have been the longest in other words where the churn has had sometimes settled a bit, and you see there are share in places like Tokyo and Sendai and Fukuoka has been encouraging and that trend is not any different it continues.","So, it's really not new news on that front. We do see that consumers' conversion rates to our product are very good and better than the competition and we do see that the product appreciation is higher. We have had the issue of reliability on our devices which is much improved now. We showed at Investor Day, the more recent production batches of the 2.4 plus have been increasingly more reliable and robust and much lower return rates. That continues.","And we believe that 3 and 3 Multi are very well executed devices and will be able to help us in the competition with consumers and so we're really encouraged. And in fact from the point of view of competition, it's actually good for the category for competitors to come with better products and have overall category grow faster.","So, we think we are in pretty good spot. We have a great innovation machine that we showed at Investor Day to keep us ahead of the competition and that's where we intend to stay. But we are not complacent about it, we're working hard on it.","Pamela Kaufman","Thanks. And just a question about the upcoming FDA PMTA meeting next week, what are your expectations for that meeting and do you think that there might be any clarity on IQOS coming out of it?","Martin King","Look, I don't have any new information with regards to the FDA from what we communicated at Investor Day. We're hopeful to hear from the FDA that it's really in their hands and I don't know that we're anticipating any particular meeting that's going to be the big breakthrough.","So, there is really nothing new from what we communicated there.","Pamela Kaufman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much for allowing the follow up question. One of the things that struck me in your presentation was the pricing variance in combustibles in the EU of 8%. I was just wondering if you could say where that came from in terms of geography is that from Germany mainly and in particular what's happening to France because that had negative variance is what I believe anyway depending on the [indiscernible].","Martin King","Yes. Germany is the biggest driver in EU pricing and there is no new news on France. We still have the situation there of expected higher prices going forward as the government has communicated and the pricing efficiency is not very good there because of the structure of the tax.","So, the overall pricing headwind that we had in France is still more of less what it was before.","Adam Spielman","And if you had to mention after Germany, the next two biggest contributors?","Martin King","Next two after Germany, well worldwide it would be like Philippines and some of the other ones. Within EU Germany is the biggest one. But we have pricing across the EU. I mean in Poland, in Italy there is pricing across the EU it's really hard to flag any one market that's driving it other than Germany being the biggest one.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that was our final question. I'll turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin King","Yes. I just wanted to close with a couple of the key messages that we ended with Investor Day. It starts with our commitment to the success for transformation to the smoke-free future when it gets good for smoker in particular but also very good for shareholders.","I think you've seen that the efforts are starting in bear fruit in the volume numbers, the share numbers for this quarter gives us good momentum moving forward. It's built on that strong combustible tobacco business which depends on the foundation in a wake for us to form the transformation and get to a better place for shareholders. Very promising growth in RRP's across the geographies you heard about.","We've got the innovation machine behind all this to try to stay ahead of it and all of it supports the achievable three year currency neutral compound annual growth targets that we communicated at Investor Day around at least 5% for next revenues ex-currency and at least 8% for the adjusted diluted EPS.","So, I think our business is in good shape. We're showing good momentum and we're looking forward to reporting the results going forward. Thanks very much everybody for being on the call.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17361":["Philip Morris International, Inc.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2018 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides which are posted on our website.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer period. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I would like to begin with some general thoughts on our performance in 2018. We achieved robust results from our combustible tobacco portfolio and nearly doubled our heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume, driven by growth in all IQOS markets. We fell short of our initial full year net revenue growth target provided in February last year, which was almost entirely attributable to lower than anticipated IQOS consumer acquisition in Japan and related distributor heated tobacco unit inventory adjustments. In our view, this overshadowed an otherwise robust financial and strategic performance across the business. Clearly and understandably, this contributed to the overall decline in our share price, which was also pressured by broader market concerns surrounding the industry and the consumer staples sector generally.","While we recognize that the market is the ultimate judge, we find it difficult to understand the share price impact of certain developments in the industry last year, particularly those that were very U.S. centric and arguably less relevant to our international business. Entering 2019, I believe that we have laid the foundation for a better business performance this year and beyond, thanks to significant investments in product portfolio development and organizational capabilities, including a state-of-the-art digital infrastructure to fuel our expansion. As I will cover in my remarks in a moment, the underlying strength of our combustible product portfolio remains undoubtedly intact and our smoke-free products are the catalyst to accelerate our overall business growth.","Let me now take you through the main elements of our full year results starting with volume. Our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume declined by 2.1%, notably reflecting the reduction in distributor heated tobacco unit inventory in Japan, which we explained during our third quarter 2018 results call. Excluding estimated net distributor inventory movements, total shipment volume was flat, our best annual performance since 2012 with strong growth in heated tobacco units offsetting a decline in cigarette. This performance compares favorably to an estimated decline in total industry volume of 1.6% on the same basis.","Our cigarette shipment volume declined by 2.8%, the decrease was due mainly to lower industry volume, notably in Russia and Saudi Arabia, coupled with the impact of consumer switching from cigarettes to heated tobacco product, particularly in Japan, Korea and the EU region. Increased shipment volume, notably in Pakistan and Turkey, driven by higher industry volume and in Thailand driven by higher market share served as a partial offset. Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 14.2% to 41.4 billion units despite estimated net distributor inventory movements in Japan of approximately 17 billion units. More importantly, our in-market sales volume for heated tobacco units nearly doubled, reaching 44.3 billion units, a significant achievement driven by all IQOS launch markets, including Japan and Korea.","Turning to our 2018 financial results, net revenues increased by 3.4%, excluding currency, driven by strong pricing of our combustible tobacco portfolio and heated tobacco unit shipment volume growth. The users\u2019 product net revenues reached $4.1 billion or 15.8% of total net revenues, with IQOS devices and accessories accounting for approximately $0.9 billion or 22%. For reference, last year distributor inventory adjustment in Japan of an estimated 4.5 billion units adversely impacted our total net revenue growth, excluding currency, by approximately 1.2 points. The move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina further impacted growth by approximately 0.6 points.","Our 2018 combustible tobacco pricing variance represented 7.6% of prior year combustible tobacco net revenues, with positive contributions from all 6 of our regions. Pricing was particularly strong in Canada, Germany, Indonesia, the Philippines and Russia. The strong pricing performance in Russia benefited from a very favorable comparison following essentially no net pricing in the market in 2017. Also, in the Philippines, we benefited from improved industry pricing dynamics following the significant decrease in non-tax product availability.","On a currency neutral basis, adjusted operating income was essentially flat, while our adjusted operating income margin decreased by 1.3 points. The margin decline primarily reflected the impact of our net incremental RRP investments of approximately $600 million. For reference, the factors mentioned previously for Japan and Argentina had an adverse combined impact on our currency-neutral adjusted operating income growth and margin of approximately 3.3 and 1.1 percentage points respectively. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.10 increased by 8.1% driven by both a lower effective tax rate and net interest expense. Excluding adverse currency of $0.11, which occurred in the second half of the year, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 10.4%. The lower effective tax rate and net interest expense were both driven by the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Our 2018 effective tax rate decreased to approximately 23%, slightly better than the 24% that we had assumed as part of our guidance in November and around 5 to 6 points below our effective tax rate in the years prior to tax reform. The decrease in net interest expense resulted from greater flexibility on cash repatriation and capital structure optimization provided by the reform.","Our operating cash flow of $9.5 billion increased by over $500 million, or 6.4% principally driven by higher net earnings partly offset by unfavorable currency. Capital expenditures of $1.4 billion came in below our full year assumption, primarily reflecting continued improvement in heated tobacco unit investment efficiency as equipment productivity rises.","Turning now to market share, our total international share of 28.4% increased by 0.5 points, our highest organic growth since 2008 driven by heated tobacco units, which reached a share of 1.6%. Remarkably, share grew in all six of our regions, underlining the strength of our combined portfolio. Our share of the international cigarette category was flat at 27.4%, demonstrating our success in maintaining cigarette market leadership while transitioning our product portfolio and transforming our overall organization. Further, despite over-indexed IQOS out-switching and the impact of the sizable volume contraction in Saudi Arabia during the first half of the year, Marlboro\u2019s international share of the cigarette category was also flat, reflecting share growth in a number of markets, including France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines and Turkey.","With the performance of IQOS being top of mind for investors, let me also highlight some of the latest results and developments, beginning with an overall view, followed by some market specific commentary. As seen on this slide, the total estimated number of IQOS users reached 9.6 million in the fourth quarter, continuing the positive quarterly sequential growth trend. Importantly, nearly 70% of the total, an estimated 6.6 million users, have already stopped smoking by switching to IQOS, while the balance are in conversion. IQOS user growth in the quarter was especially driven by the EU region and Russia. Approximately 1\/3 of the total IQOS user base is now in markets outside Asia, which highlights the broadening geographic success of the brand\u2019s proposition. As announced last year, we began the global launch of our IQOS 3 devices in mid-November, starting with our own retail and e-commerce channels. Though still early as full device availability and expansion to our main distribution channels has only occurred in the past couple of weeks, we are very pleased with the initial consumer reaction to the new device lineup across IQOS markets.","I will now turn to the performance of IQOS in specific geographies, beginning with Japan. As discussed during our earnings call in October, there were sizable trade and consumer purchases of both cigarettes and heated tobacco units across the industry during the third quarter in advance of the excise tax-driven price increases on October 1. This led to a distortion in heated tobacco unit in-market sales in both the third and fourth quarters. The same distortion is reflected in our share progression between the third and fourth quarter. When equalized for the purchase patterns, our estimated share in each quarter was approximately 15.4%.","Looking to 2019, we are encouraged that the favorable heated tobacco unit weekly off-take share trend that we observed during the fourth quarter continued in January. We anticipate increased competitive activity this year, including new heated tobacco product launches. This may accelerate overall category growth, in part by reducing the consumption dilution observed with current competitive device ownership, which I will show shortly. In this context, we believe that the new IQOS 3 and its continued superior sensorial experience in combination with the range of initiatives that we rolled out during the later part of last year, including the mid-priced HEETS brand, will allow us to restore growth. Importantly, the convenience store channel, which accounts for the vast majority of our volume, began selling IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 MULTI as of last week. But already, IQOS 3 has significantly increased the number of new users acquired by IQOS compared to the 2018 monthly average prior to IQOS 3 launch.","Furthermore, the national rollout of the HEETS brand, which is currently only available in geographies with approximately 25% of the country\u2019s tobacco consumers will begin in the coming weeks. We remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential of the heated tobacco category in Japan and of our brand specifically. Japanese adult smokers continue to show a strong and growing interest in heated tobacco product as demonstrated by device ownership and past 7-day usage trend. Based on the latest available data over 45% of Japanese tobacco consumers owned at least one device while over 40% reported using a heated tobacco product over the past 7 days, while these indicators of category interest are not yet fully reflected in the latest category share of consumption of around 23%, this is understandable for a couple of reasons.","First, switching takes time, with a lag between device purchase, use and the full conversion that maximizes heated tobacco share. This is easiest to see through the end of 2017, when IQOS was essentially the only product on the market at scale. Second and more importantly, other heated tobacco product, which became broadly available over the course of \u201817 and \u201818 have been far less effective than IQOS in fully converting adult smokers. This is due to relatively low taste satisfaction, leading to mainly situational use that further dilutes the category share relative to device ownership. Lower conversion effectiveness is also generating some hesitation among more conservative cigarette smokers to enter the category at this stage. Many users of competitive devices have never tried IQOS, and certain IQOS users also own a competitive device. Both groups represent great opportunities for us, with IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 MULTI. Over time, as competitive products improve and more heated tobacco users experience the relative benefits of IQOS, particularly those who began their heated tobacco journey with a competitive product, we expect the gap between total category share and the level of device ownership to narrow.","Turning to Korea, fourth quarter share for HEETS of 8.5% increased by 3 points compared to the same period in 2017 or by 1.1 points sequentially, it should be noted that our share in the quarter was distorted by trade inventory movements ahead of the change in health warnings on heated tobacco products in late December. We are pleased with our share performance, particularly given the backdrop of additional competitive activity in the heated tobacco category as the year progressed as well as the confusion among some adult smokers caused by the Korean FDA\u2019s comments last year regarding the tar generated by heated tobacco products. In-market sales volume for HEETS increased slightly on a sequential basis to 1.5 billion units. Looking to 2019, IQOS remains the preeminent brand in the category, with HEETS holding over 75% category share in the fourth quarter. This position has been reinforced by the launch of our new devices, giving us confidence in our ability to grow HEETS volume and share further.","In the European Union Region, fourth quarter share for HEETS reached 1.7% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, an increase of 1.1 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, supported by all IQOS markets. On a sequential basis, share growth accelerated in the quarter, increasing by 0.5 points. It is worth noting that IQOS is only present in geographic areas representing approximately 47% of industry total volume in the region. The favorable share momentum reflects continued growth in the total number of IQOS users, which reached nearly 1.8 million by year-end. Importantly, as of late January, IQOS 3 is finally fully available in essentially all IQOS markets across the region.","Our HEETS share growth in the EU region was driven by a number of markets, notably Greece, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Italy, Poland and Germany. As we have said before, the speed of IQOS adoption will vary by market. This reflects factors such as the underlying disposition of adult smokers to use and recommend innovative tobacco products as well as the regulations that apply to reduced-risk products, such as those that impact our ability to communicate to adult smokers about better alternatives to continued cigarette smoking. Despite related constraints in certain geographies, IQOS is growing across all EU launch markets, and the fourth quarter accelerations are going well for 2019.","In Russia, the strong sequential performance of IQOS continued in the fourth quarter, with HEETS market share up by 0.7 points to 1.8% of the total number of IQOS users, reaching 0.8 million. This performance is impressive given the fact that IQOS is present in only 7 cities, where the average fourth quarter share for HEETS was nearly 8%, with share in Moscow approaching double digits. This primarily reflects increased adult smoker interest in and understanding and acceptance of IQOS as well as our targeted approach to geographic and channel expansion, which has underpinned an improvement in IQOS conversion rates and consumer experience. Given our success in the existing large cities, we are now expanding into additional geographic areas.","Before I turn to our 2019 outlook, let me remind you of the 3-year financial growth targets that we outlined during our Investor Day last September. For the 2019 to 2021 period, we are targeting currency-neutral compound annual growth of at least 5% for net revenues and at least 8% for adjusted diluted earnings per share. As detailed in today\u2019s press release, we have adjusted the formulation of our annual EPS guidance to reflect the difficulty in determining with precision the speed at which adult smokers will adopt reduced risk products. At the beginning of each year, we will now forecast our annual reported diluted EPS and the related currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS growth rate by reference to a minimum threshold of expected performance. As each year unfolds, we intend to provide greater detail.","For 2019, we forecast reported diluted earnings per share to be at least $5.37 at prevailing exchange rates compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $5.08 in 2018. Excluding an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8% versus adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.10 in 2018. Our 2019 forecast assumes currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%, which includes an expected adverse impact of approximately 0.6 points due to the move to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina.","We expect IQOS and heated tobacco unit volume growth, in particular, to be the key driver of this growth. Combustible tobacco pricing will remain an important contributor, underpinned by the broadly rational tobacco excise tax environment and mitigating the impact of the anticipated combustible product volume decline. As noted earlier, we recorded an exceptional pricing variance in 2018 that creates a challenging pricing comparison this year. We expect our average pricing variance over the 2018 and \u201819 2-year period to be in line with our average annual pricing variance from 2008 to 2017. We anticipate the total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline of approximately 1.5% to 2% in 2019. This compares favorably to an estimated total industry decline of around 2.5% to 3% for the year. Given the challenge of forecasting with precision heated tobacco unit shipment volumes, we are not providing a specific 2019 target at this early stage of the year. That said, we expect positive volume contributions from all IQOS markets in 2019, and we remain confident in our shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021.","Turning to our cost base, our efforts to deliver over $1 billion in annualized cost efficiencies by 2021 are already underway led by important initiatives related to productivity, zero-based budgeting, a project-based organization model and other cost reduction opportunities. We expect our progress on this front to contribute to an increase in currency-neutral operating income margin of at least 100 basis points in 2019. We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23% consistent with last year and a relatively stable net interest expense compared to 2018. We are targeting 2019 operating cash flow of at least $10 billion subject to year end working capital requirements. We project total capital expenditures this year of approximately $1.1 billion reflecting further investment behind RRPs in particular to support our platform for e-vapor manufacturing capacity.","I will close our 2019 outlook with some comments on the first quarter. While we don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, I believe that it is appropriate to share some additional visibility related to pricing. We currently anticipate reported diluted EPS of approximately $1 in the quarter or flat compared to last year, subject to the timing of commercial spending associated with some of our IQOS related projects. Excluding approximately $0.09 of adverse currency at prevailing exchange rates, this represents a growth rate of 9% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $1 in the first quarter of 2018, which itself included a positive contribution from currency of $0.03 or approximately 3 percentage points.","I will conclude with a few key takeaways from our 2018 performance. As evidenced by our total share growth internationally and our stable share of the cigarette category, we are successfully managing our transition from cigarettes to reduced-risk products. Our combustible tobacco portfolio remains the foundation of our business and is delivering robust performance and pricing power. Furthermore, the international cigarette industry volume decline was broadly in line with historical trend. IQOS continues to grow globally, nearly doubling heated tobacco unit in-market sales volume in 2018 and increasing the number of markets, making important contributions to its success. We estimate that as of year end over 6.6 million adult smokers around the world had already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. We estimate a retail value of approximately $18 billion for the combined heated tobacco and e-vapor category outside China and the U.S., with heated tobacco representing approximately 70% of the total. IQOS alone accounts for an estimated 57% of the combined retail value, with unit margins and switching rates superior to any other nicotine product. We expect to increase our share of the e-vapor market through further development and deployment of our product portfolio.","Turning to 2019, we anticipate better underlying business fundamentals, driving currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%. Our 2019 EPS forecast reflects a growth rate of at least 8%, excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $5.10 in 2018. Finally, we remain confident in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that our RRP portfolio continues to provide us with a single largest opportunity to accelerate our business growth and generously reward our shareholders over time. Thank you for listening. Martin and I are now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, Andr\u00e9. I actually first wanted to ask you about Altria\u2019s decision to take a stake in JUUL. I would really love to hear your thoughts on this and if you think this was a good decision for them. And also given the rapid growth of e-cigs in several markets internationally, would you guys consider some type of distribution agreement with JUUL? I think you will answer on you believe your technology is superior, but couldn\u2019t there be a case for you to do both especially you are still not at a point really to fully rollout your technology?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, I will start by reminding everyone that, because there is a lot of discussion amongst investors and in the media in general what is the potential of x product, y product, JUUL, IQOS and so on and we have to understand that this is not a binary or a zero-sum game or winner takes all kind of situation. I think you can say there are some form of parallelism with intersections in the trajectory of consumers between e-vapor products, lighter-pure nicotine products and heated tobacco products. We know that heated tobacco products have the highest conversion ability, but there are people that in markets where IQOS doesn\u2019t exist, that have already switched fully to e-vapor products. And there are people that use both. So, we are going to see very different behaviors that are sometimes complementary and nonexclusive. We will see we know that there is dual usage of e-vapor and cigarettes. We have people that may continue using the same amount, of cigarettes and have a few additional e-vapor products. And you will also see heated tobacco products, like IQOS and e-vapor, being used simultaneously. That\u2019s why we developed a portfolio of products that can cater to all consumers and that will see all kinds of combination going forward. So, we are ready to compete with everybody, and I think competition in the category and the ability to switch people out of cigarettes is very important. I mentioned in my remarks, Japan, where we see that not subsidiary performing products in terms of sensory experience dilute the category, and we welcome products that can. So, I think, for us, as a matter of principle, there is room for all products, and there will be no one exclusive user of our competitor in any category. So, I think we know sufficiently, and we have demonstrated over the past year that we understand all the categories, and so we understand all the consumers, okay? So, in our situation, to a certain degree, we\u2019re not in the same market as Altria and I will not comment on the Altria decisions because they have to look at their own portfolio and situation. And they took the decision to make the investment, which I respect. I think nothing has changed in the relationship we have with Altria in preparation of the IQOS launch in the U.S., and I think Altria confirmed that they are fully ready once we get FDA approval to go for IQOS. And we are looking forward to this moment. As far as JUUL is concerned, clearly, JUUL benefits from a certain degree of awareness due to the U.S. market in certain English-speaking countries. So, we\u2019ll see some initial success, for sure, because there is awareness as we had with IQOS, for example, in some markets when we entered, like Korea. But then, we have to see the sustainability of the product proposition, both from a marketing and product performance point of view. But again, there is no one winner takes it all, okay? So, I think we have to go over this, this initial excitement and discussion, who is going to be the winning technology, who is going to be the winning brand. I think there will be many brands. I believe IQOS is already a very well-established brand, as I said in my remarks. If we combine the e-vapor and heated tobacco category, and the e-vapor category internationally is essentially in the EU and has been fairly stable, IQOS has 57% of the entire retail value of both categories combined, and we\u2019re not even in the e-vapor category. We plan to enter significantly the e-vapor category as of the end of this year, including with the devices we showed in Investors Day that are smaller devices to cater to different consumers\u2019 needs. And that\u2019s why we also said we increased a little bit the CapEx so that we have capacity to develop this to commercialize this product. And I think we are ready for competing. The only thing I would say is JUUL, I hope they learned their lessons regarding certain undesirable target audiences that we are very careful and extremely wise about. And I hope that the Altria participation will increase their attention to unintended audiences. That\u2019s all I have to say.","Bonnie Herzog","Now that was helpful. And then if I may, I wanted to ask a little bit more about the new innovation you just put into the market in November that you discussed a bit. But if you could drill down a little bit further for us and talk about if it did, in fact, meet your expectations or possibly exceed your expectations so far. And then what will the rest of the rollout schedule look like? For instance, I think you\u2019re still planning to do a phased rollout, but will the bulk of the new devices be in the market by the end of Q1, or is it by the end of Q2? And then last point on this, I\u2019d like to hear from you just a little bit more about the cannibalization you might have been seeing. You mentioned, I think, it\u2019s been quite incremental, but I just kind of wanted a better understanding of that.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. We\u2019re talking about 2 different things, if I understand. The first is the rollout of what we call IQOS 3 devices and IQOS MULTI, and the other, what happens with the second lineup of consumables we have in Japan. Is that correct?","Bonnie Herzog","Yes.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. So, a bit limited initially on IQOS 3 and IQOS 3 moved in many markets, so we made the product available only through our own retail and e-commerce. And we also made the product, so we had limitations, and I have to say we\u2019re very pleased with the initial reaction. People understand and appreciate also the IQOS MULTI because that was a clear consumer need. We have combined sales of both, and that\u2019s very good. And we also continue selling IQOS 2.4. So, although it\u2019s a limited sample, I would say, because we are not national and in every retail channel with IQOS 3, the first indications is things are happening the way we had foreseen are happening. And the comments from the consumers are good. And if you look at more to use Net Promoter Scores, we have improved also significantly the Net Promoter Score of IQOS in Japan, in particular, and in other places. And at the same time, we see new user acquisition, even with this limited availability of IQOS 3 increasing. So, it\u2019s early indications, but they are good indications, and we see the same in other markets. We\u2019ll give a bit more color and granularity in CAGNY because we will have a bit more weeks behind us with full availability. But so far, so good. Now regarding HEETS, our reading is they help from the limited markets again we\u2019re in. They help increase consumer acquisition because we cater to people that are a bit more price-sensitive. We have incremental share if you combine both Marlboro heated units and HEETS in the places we were, and that\u2019s why we decided to extend. There is obviously a certain cannibalization because we are, essentially, the only product. But overall, we have share increase, and that\u2019s the encouraging part.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So, Andr\u00e9, I guess I wanted to ask a little bit more about the volume outlook for 2019. I know you\u2019re not giving specific volume target for IQOS, but clearly, you\u2019re giving the consolidated volume guidance of down 1.5% to 2%. So, I think we can kind of back into what you\u2019re, at least high level, expecting for IQOS if we assume combustibles down somewhere around 3%, 3.5%. So maybe a little bit more color just in terms of, at a high level, how do you see volume kind of playing out for IQOS and combustibles. And then more specifically, in Japan, just based on JT\u2019s comment earlier today that they\u2019re expecting only 3% category growth for the heat-not-burn this year, I\u2019m just wondering if you think that the growth rate could be more robust or is that kind of a more prudent assumption at this point in the year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look, we see clearly growth in all the markets where IQOS is present, okay, volume growth. I mean, I would not read too much in the forecast of global combined cigarettes and everything because, frankly speaking, we were positively surprised last year by the combustible category as well with more positive volumes than we initially anticipate. All I would say is we are in line with the projection I gave for 3 years down the line, 90 billion to 100 billion, and I would not venture in more precise volumes this year because they are baked in the, at least, 5% revenue growth, okay? In Japan, in particular, if you have noticed from the slides, I don\u2019t know if you had the opportunity to see them, we see growth in the share of IQOS, actually in Japan, in January, the share of IQOS was 16.5%. So that\u2019s very nice compared to 15.4% we had in the previous quarters. I would not it\u2019s in 1 month, and I would not read anything into this, but it\u2019s a positive development. And EU and Russia, as you have seen, we have very positive trends. So, we are very optimistic, but we\u2019ll keep you abreast on what\u2019s happening as the year unfolds.","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a little bit more specific to Russia because obviously, that\u2019s one market where, clearly, you\u2019ve seen improvement sequentially, both on the volume side and market share side. I guess my questions are, number one, is that starting to have a bigger impact on the broader combustible category volume, certainly in markets like Moscow, where you\u2019ve got a pretty sizable share with IQOS? And then just broadly speaking, as you kind of roll out IQOS into additional cities in Russia, kind of the cadence of volume trajectory that you\u2019re expecting as you implement that strategy going forward?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look, I mean, as we expand in different cities, we\u2019ll see additional volume, obviously. We also need to understand, we are in the richest and more affluent cities, and we see continued growth. As we expand over time, maybe the growth trajectories will be a bit slower because we are reaching lower-income consumers. But overall, I think Russia piloted a number of practices, including using digital tools, that show that we can scale up efficiently without necessarily expanding manpower everywhere. And that\u2019s something, now that we have the digital platforms, as I said, and infrastructure available and we\u2019re rolling it out as we speak, should be an accelerator this year and most importantly, in the years to come, with also much more cost efficiency underlying the growth trajectories of IQOS. So, I see I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with what\u2019s happening in Russia. I think it\u2019s a very clear demonstration that IQOS has potential everywhere, even in markets that have less purchasing power. And the testing of the tools show that we can scale with much more efficiency than before. So, it\u2019s all very positive signs.","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay. And then just my last question. Just in terms of your profit guidance or the operating margin being up about 100 basis points, it seems like that\u2019s mostly around being the half of kind of the incremental spending that you put into place in 2018 kind of not growing again. So, I\u2019m just curious if that\u2019s sort of the correct interpretation. And I know that IQOS has been pretty volatile just in terms of thinking about the profit performance. So, when you kind of look at the 100 basis points operating margin target, how comfortable are you that you should be in position to deliver on that target even if volume slows or other things happen from an IQOS kind of volatility standpoint?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look, we are fairly confident we can then deliver on this. It\u2019s a combination of, as we said, lower spending, much lower spending than last year, but still incremental spending. And the second one is an increased volume contribution of IQOS to the overall earnings. And as we know, IQOS has better margins. So that\u2019s the way I would read it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you very much so first, can I just follow up on the answer you gave to Judy, just to make sure I got it, absolutely right? With respect to the 100 basis points, it sounds like the majority of that is coming from the efficiencies of rolling out IQOS that you always said you were going to get. And yes, we\u2019re talking about the rise at the beginning of last year and less of it is coming from the new, relatively new use of $1 billion ZBB savings. Is that the correct way of understanding that last answer?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","That\u2019s correct. We started the ZBB project. But as you can understand, it\u2019s not going to deliver big amounts of money in the first year because we have to go through the whole process and do it properly, okay? So, I see this participating as of the next year. And we never said, just to be clear, that the $1 billion we are targeting is all money that you\u2019re going to see on the bottom line, but you should see a portion of that to the bottom line. The other helps the incremental investment, so the deltas are not as big as they used to be in the previous year.","Adam Spielman","Okay thank you very much. So, the real question or the more important question is around IQOS. And I was surprised, frankly, how strong it was in this quarter relative to the third quarter. And I was just wondering if there were any shipping effects we should be calling out. Clearly, Japan was harmed by shipping effects. You called out a positive one in Korea. But for example, in Italy and in Russia, where there any shipping effects that somehow artificially boosted your IQOS volumes?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. There were, some shipment in Russia ahead of we\u2019re expanding in different cities. So, there is its preparation of the expansion, okay? I don\u2019t remember exactly how much that was, around $1 billion, $0.8 billion, something like that, if I can recall correctly, okay?","Martin King","It was planned.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","It was planned from the beginning, so it\u2019s not something but there is nothing else in there. The rest is direct in-market sales, okay?","Adam Spielman","And so, for example, if you will focus just on Italy, there was a huge jump in market share in Italy in 4Q, even relative to 3Q. I was just wondering if you can explain what caused that and how we should think about it going forward as well?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","That\u2019s a very good question. First of all, I think we see momentum in Italy. It took a lot of time, if you remember, Adam, to get Italy moving given the restrictions. And I think it\u2019s just the fact that there are more consumers of IQOS in Italy, so start having word-of-mouth, okay? Again, I wouldn\u2019t read 1 quarter as the proxy for the acceleration, but the momentum is there. So, I think, in Italy, finally, we start seeing this better than slow linearity of growth, and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. And this is ahead of us deploying further of the efficiency tools I described. But this is what you read in Italy, share of the market. It\u2019s nothing to do with inventories and shipments and all these things.","Adam Spielman","Perfect. And then one final question for me. And this is about the guidance. Am I correct to understand, you\u2019re giving guidance in sort of 2 different sorts of ways, firstly, you\u2019re giving floor guidance? So, it\u2019s a minimum of 5% sales growth. It\u2019s a minimum of 8% constant currency EPS. But then when you\u2019re talking about things like the volume, the combined volume figures, that\u2019s more of an expectation. It\u2019s not a floor. And is that correct that it\u2019s more in the sense and the style you used to give guidance, that this is really what you expect to happen? And it might be a little bit worse, it might be a little bit better. But the EPS isn\u2019t really an absolute floor in terms of constant currency?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yes. I mean, look, volume for the year is a bit difficult to estimate. So, we gave a range of 1.5% to 2%, okay? That\u2019s our estimate. It can come better or slightly worse. It depends on the combustible as well. So, it\u2019s just to give you a flavor of what we see compared to total market, which means we expect share growth in this whole context, helped obviously by the IQOS units as well. But I mean, the key guidance is more than 5% and more than 8%, and that\u2019s how it is.","Nick Rolli","Yes, at least.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","All right?","Nick Rolli","At least.","Martin King","At least.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","At least, yes.","Adam Spielman","Yes at least. And can I tempt you to sort of give a sort of offering so that you\u2019d be really surprised if, let\u2019s say, it was more than 12% on EPS? Or how big is that at least? I mean, how big is it? To me, it\u2019s very conservative.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, as the year goes, I had I think depending on what happens, we\u2019ll give you better forecast for the remaining year. I would stay to what I said at this stage, and that\u2019s all I can tell you at this stage, Adam.","Adam Spielman","Thank you. I failed to tempt you. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi, thank you. Good afternoon.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So, I wanted to follow up on the IQOS 3 launch in Japan, and I appreciate you want to hold some of this detail back for when we see you in CAGNY in a couple of weeks. But can you offer any color around like the underlying consumer demographics of the new users that you indicated you\u2019ve been acquiring? Is it kind of going deeper into that kind of first tranche of consumers, kind of younger, more affluent, or are you finally starting to see early success in terms of penetrating that 55 Plus market that had proven a bit elusive? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, clearly, we made \u2013 first of all and foremost, we made these devices available as an option to existing users of IQOS, especially part of our, what we call the IQOS sphere and exclusive users, okay, because I think that\u2019s fair to these people to have first access. But we also see now sales from people that have never bought IQOS before. I don\u2019t have the demographics to be fair with you \u2013 with me, but we\u2019ll provide them in CAGNY. And I would not like \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t provide statistics just with 1 weeks or 2 weeks of rollout, okay? So, what I \u2013 I repeat what I said before, we also see sales of 2.4 Plus surprisingly because people knew that the new device is coming and still bought 2.4, especially the most price-sensitive consumers, which in my view shows that the strategy works and that there will be people that they will enter the category also through 2.4 Plus. Don\u2019t forget, we kept the previous version at a lower price and we sell the new devices at a higher price, so we have a dual strategy. And I think this in combination with the HEETS that are at a lower price than the Marlboro consumables are for IQOS, will help us increase the penetration of the more price-sensitive consumers, okay.","Vivien Azer","Okay. That sounds great and totally reasonable and I look forward to hearing more about that at CAGNY when you have more data. My other question on the RRP category in Japan, just to kind of follow up on Judy\u2019s question, I certainly appreciate your point that with a host of product activity from you and your peers that, that should engage more Japanese consumers. The question though that I have is do you have adequately embedded in your guidance increased spend? I know you\u2019ve got a really favorable comp, but given that you\u2019ve got new products from a host of competitors hitting in 2019, how are you thinking about incremental investment spend in Japan specifically? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, we have embedded overall, I would not make specific comments for markets, incremental spending. As I said, it\u2019s much less than last year, but it\u2019s still a lot of incremental spending and I think we\u2019re adequately equipped to compete in Japan. At the same time, as I said, we\u2019re also rolling out digital tools and CRM platforms we didn\u2019t have before. And that should help cause the retention, which we should not forget, including making existing IQOS users that own multiple devices to go back and exclusively use IQOS, which IQOS 3 helps significantly in achieving this. So overall, I think we are in good shape. We knew the competition is going to come. And I think at the end of the day, a better product will increase the full conversion over time and then over time also, the best product will win. But as I said many times, we\u2019re not going to have 80% of the segment forever in Japan. What is important is that the entire category grows over time and I see no reason why the category will not grow. Every indication from what we showed is, is with the right product portfolio, the category will continue to grow.","Vivien Azer","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Lavery.","Michael Lavery","Good afternoon. Thank you. You have several markets in Europe now that have around a mid-single-digit or even higher IQOS share. But typically, those countries still don\u2019t have national expansions. Can you give us both a sense of when that might come and also in some launch cities or launch areas, what the share might look like? If you\u2019re giving to us now on a national basis, what does it look like where it\u2019s a little bit more concentrated?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, I mean, if I \u2013 as I said, if you take the European Union, we are roughly at 50%, 47% of volume-weighted, if you want, present. So, our share in the European Union would be double in the places where we are present, roughly speaking, okay, so it\u2019s 1.7, I think it would be 3.4, okay, as\u2026","Michael Lavery","Yes. I understand that math. I guess, more specifically, some of the places you\u2019ve launched first like Milan, Rome, Prague, Athens, not necessarily first, but where there\u2019s been either a longer history and\/or a more rapid acceleration and better awareness. What does the share look like in some of those places that are your better performers that when you give a national share, might be masked a little bit by places that \u2013 in that country you still haven\u2019t launched yet or that have just \u2013 that are just getting started?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yes, look, I don\u2019t have all the numbers. If I recall correctly, Athens is well above 10, because I know, it\u2019s my home city, okay. Actually, yes, it is \u2013 the whole region of Attica, including Athens is 14% now, which is pretty high and growing. Milano, I don\u2019t have it, if somebody can help me here.","Martin King","Rome is about double the \u2013 ","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Just 1 second. Milan actually is an interest experiment because it\u2019s where we tried the first ways in the past. It was very flat, took us a lot of time to make consumers try the product again. But if I\u2019m not mistaken \u2013 ","Nick Rolli","It will be in Milan or in Rome \u2013 ","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay, sorry, but in Milan or in Rome, it\u2019s 5.3, something like that, okay. We\u2019ll give you bit more color in CAGNY on all this. But for me Milano is probably the most important because it is the most difficult city because of the previous presence of IQOS to regain momentum and we did. So that\u2019s a very good sign, actually.","Michael Lavery","Okay. No, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then just on your thoughts on more national expansions in any other European markets or you\u2019ve already talked about Russia expanding a little bit more. Is that one that you would expect to go national as well?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look we go gradually in most of the markets. As I said previously, our objective, I mean, we are at 43, call it markets today. The priority is to expand nationally to see the full potential in these markets, now that we can scale up efficiently. And during the year, we may open new markets if there\u2019s strategic opportunity or the regulation changes, but the focus is to expand nationally in the markets where we are and that\u2019s what we are following, okay.","Michael Lavery","Okay, that\u2019s great. And then just a little bit more of a housekeeping question, you talked about the 100 basis points margin expansion X currency. Do you have any sense of what the transactional currency impact might be that we should have in mind or to factor in there?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I have not \u2013 I don\u2019t have the calculation, but traditionally, our transactional currency is 10% of the total currency impact. If I can use this as a rule of thumb, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s more than that.","Michael Lavery","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","Hi. Thank you for the question. You made comments at the beginning of the call that the share price performance, which has partly been impacted by industry concerns that are more U.S.-specific. I wanted to get a sense if this influences your view on timing for reinstating share buybacks?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look, we look at the share buyback regularly. And I think for the moment, the conclusion is that we follow the plan. I think Martin explained that if we look at the 3-year period including this year, it\u2019s in the outer years that we will be in a position without losing our rating to restore share buybacks. I understand it may be tempting for \u2013 to do this, but I think we have to stick to the plan because I believe that some of the impact on the shares as I explained is due to our lower-than-expected initially performance, but the reality is also there is a lot of uncertainty that I\u2019ve been trying to clarify.","And we\u2019ll clarify even better e-cigarette categories, e-vapor worldwide and heat-not-burn and all the interactions in CAGNY. I think it\u2019s a necessary anxiety there. And in this context, I think for us, our focus is to deliver the results quarter-after-quarter and get the growth of the products. And I\u2019m sure investors will appreciate these and have the share going up rather than doing very opportunistic share repurchases rather than based on a clear plan when the time is right for them.","Pamela Kaufman","Okay. And you mentioned that combustible pricing would \u2013 should moderate towards more in line with the historical pricing growth in 2019. What do you see as the puts and takes contributing to your outlook, and are you still anticipating a relatively benign excise tax environment this year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","No, I think the excise tax \u2013 if you look globally, the excise tax environment is fairly stable. I mean, yes, there are occasionally, there are 1 or 2 markets that have more than regular increases. On the other side, we have the positive surprise of Indonesia, where the government decided not to increase excise taxes, okay, so which would help volume. What I was trying to say in my remarks is we have to see 2018 as a very exceptional year because of Russia comparisons, that\u2019s a major contributor to pricing, obviously, given its volume size. Russia 2018 comparisons were compared to 0 almost pricing in 2017. Also in the Philippines, because the illicit trade went away, we had the opportunity to get very significant pricing in \u201818. Obviously, that would be more regular now that we rebased our pricing in the Philippines. So, the overall environment I think of pricing has not changed. It\u2019s very robust. It\u2019s there. But all I said is we have to look at \u201817 \u2013 \u201818 and \u201819 as 2. And if you add the 2, we are very much in line with the rest, okay. And we have already taken 60% plus of the pricing so far. There\u2019s still a few markets that the price tax situation has not settled, but this is not anything major. I think overall pricing is very much in place and intact.","Pamela Kaufman","Okay. And \u2013 thank you. And just lastly, how is IQOS MESH performing? And can you provide an update on what progress you\u2019ve made on your Platform 2 and 3 products and timing?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look, IQOS MESH is only in our own e-commerce and a few stores \u2013 actually, our own stores in London. For us, it was the experimenting again to see whether the flavors we offer are acceptable to consumers, whether the product itself is acceptable and then improve before we go for much more widespread expansion of the product. So, it\u2019s very difficult to judge what is the potential. I think we learn what we need to learn. Obviously, we\u2019re there with the devices you\u2019ve seen that caters more to the pod and mod, big vape or bigger vape consumers. In Investor Day, we explained to you that we have also smaller devices that cater to different consumers. And we are investing in manufacturing capacity for those devices and related cartridges. Overall, I would say the consumer feedback we receive is very good. They recognize the product is better, much more robust, batteries, detection of end of liquid and all these things. Now we need to integrate them in the smaller devices and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing just now for rollout. P3 is a bit \u2013 we\u2019re preparing the industrial designs for the product. The product is stabilized. Clearly here I see the potential more longer term and more situational use of the product, their full conversion at this stage. So, it\u2019s not something we roll out immediately, but all in very selected places in order to get better understanding. And in Platform 2, which I think is very promising, as we know, we\u2019re working on resolving one problem that in humid climates we had some problems with the heat source, that there were some fall-offs occasionally and that\u2019s \u2013 even if it\u2019s very small, it\u2019s not acceptable. So, we are now working \u2013 I think we have a solution at lab level. We\u2019re working on how to industrialize the solution before rol-lout. So that\u2019s where we stand on all this.","Pamela Kaufman","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton of UBS.","Robert Rampton","Hi, thank you for taking my question. The first question I have is you mentioned IQOS has better margin. Could you talk about which markets you\u2019ve reached breakeven and in which markets or cities you\u2019ve achieved profit per stick, which is equal or better to cigarettes? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, IQOS in every market we\u2019re in has better margins than cigarettes. As a matter of fact, there is no one single market where we have lower margin than cigarette.","Robert Rampton","Including acquisition costs and retention?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay, we\u2019re talking about marginal contribution here, okay. As we explained many times, in all major markets, clearly, we are breakeven or above. But it takes depending on the market and the difficulty of consumer acquisition based on the restrictions, we\u2019re between 1 year to 2 years before we get to breakeven point, okay. So that\u2019s how I would read it. I think Jacek showed all the details during Investors Day on how to do it at different markets. But that\u2019s the rule of thumb, if you wish.","Robert Rampton","Okay, great. Thank you. And in terms of the upcoming menthol ban in Europe, how does \u2013 how is IQOS treated under that, and how are you guys thinking about that?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, heated tobacco products are excluded from the menthol ban, so we don\u2019t see a problem with this, of course, we need to maintain it. And for cigarettes, we are ready clearly to offer consumers some alternatives, but what we saw from markets where there is a menthol ban, nothing happened actually. People switched to the same brands very often with different variants of the brand. So, I don\u2019t expect any major thing to happen in Europe even with the menthol ban.","Robert Rampton","Superb. Thank you. And so my final question, in terms of the latest evidence on the IQOS quitting rates and human trials, could we get an update on that or is that something you\u2019ll give at CAGNY? Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I don\u2019t \u2013 nothing new in there. I mean\u2026","Nick Rolli","Conversions.","Martin King","Conversion rates.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Conversion rates are the same. And in terms of quitting rates, we don\u2019t see any change in the trajectories in Japan, which is the biggest market. If you look at cigarette or IQOS, it\u2019s \u2013 the advent of IQOS has not changed the trajectories of people quitting smoking. So, I think we are on the right side there in terms of concerns of regulators and public health people.","Robert Rampton","Superb. Thank you very much.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. Your view on superiority of heat-not-burn over e-cigarettes is clear due to the high conversion rates. Do you think regulators prefer e-cigarettes over heat-not-burn on the risk continuum of risk reduction, which is then getting reflected in higher excise taxes on heat-not-burn versus e-cigarettes in different markets?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","That\u2019s a big question. I think in principle my belief has always been that this product should be not taxed at all, okay? I\u2019m just trying to be real because a reduction of 95% or 98% is a humongous reduction, okay, if you talk heat-not-burn versus e-cigarettes versus everything. Now we have to be also realistic, that\u2019s why the \u2013 there will be some taxes. There are taxes on heated tobacco products, some countries tax e-vapor products because at the end of the day, ministries of finance need money. What is important is that there is a differential and substantial differential between the two. And that\u2019s something we have achieved so far in all the markets where IQOS is present. And I think that\u2019s something that in the foreseeable future should be maintained. So now if we look at the two categories, as I explained, consumers will decide at the end of the day how they will behave. The important thing is they move out of cigarettes. It\u2019s \u2013 because the only way to achieve harm reduction in global is to have a very high degree of people switching out of cigarettes and sticking 100% to the product. So far, heated tobacco product has proven to be much more efficient in doing this, but also e-cigarettes played a role, and then there will be people that can use both. And when we have nicotine products, maybe they use all three of them depending on the situation they are. So, you will have exclusive category users and you have dual category users as we can see already and that\u2019s why there is room for everybody. On IQOS, we have various platforms under the IQOS brand. We focused initially on the heated tobacco product because we thought and we have the proof that it has the highest efficiency. And now time has come for us to offer more products to consumers. And as we explained also in Investors Day, eventually, we will also have a product that has \u2013 use the same device with different consumables, e-vapor, heated and potentially nicotine, so consumers have absolute choice without the hassle of changing devices all the time. Now that\u2019s a bit more future music, but that\u2019s where we go. And I \u2013 that\u2019s why I say there is room for all kinds of product in the consumer journey over the years and within a day. And that\u2019s how I see the category.","Gaurav Jain","That is very, very helpful. And if I can have a follow-up on this. So, the guidance you have given for 2021 on IQOS volumes, does it include IQOS MESH volumes as well or that is just the heat-not-burn product in your view?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, it will include eventually e-vapor products, but the essence of our projection was based on IQOS to be frank with you, okay. So maybe e-vapor will become incremental on top of this volume.","Gaurav Jain","Okay. This is very helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And that was our final question. I\u2019ll now turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","Well, thank you very much for joining us today. That concludes the call. And if you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations Group. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

[Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2015 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we\u2019ll be talking about results for the first quarter of 2015, and comparing them to the same period in 2014, unless otherwise stated.","A glossary of terms, data table showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to US GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Reduced risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a variety of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. I\u2019m pleased to report that PMI is off to an excellent start in 2015 with robust fundamentals driving a strong business performance that is benefitting from our investments last year.","As announced in our earnings release this morning, we\u2019re raising our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates by $0.05 to a range of $4.32 to $4.42. This increase reflect a better than expected volume and share performance in the first quarter and an improved outlook for the balance of the year. Our guidance continues to include approximately $1.15 per share of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates.","Excluding the impact of currency, our 2015 guidance represents a growth rate of 9% to 11% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014. Although the total estimated unfavorable currency impact on our revised guidance remains unchanged versus our February guidance, there has been a shift since then in its composition.","The positive impact of the appreciation of the Russian ruble and the depreciation of the Swiss franc has been offset by the unfavorable impact of a further strengthening of the US dollar versus most other currencies, particularly the euro. As exchange rates remain volatile, we do not foresee any share repurchases in 2015 and this is reflected in today\u2019s guidance.","Let me now take you through our first quarter results. Organic cigarette volume grew by 1.4%, driven by market share gains across all four regions and favorable inventory movements, notably in Italy, Spain and other markets supplied by manufacturing facilities in the EU region. This growth was partly offset by lower cigarette industry volume, principally in Japan, Korea and Russia. Excluding inventory movements, organic cigarette volume declined by an estimated 0.5%.","Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 9.1% and 16.3% respectively, driven by strong pricing across all regions and favorable volume mix in the EU and EEMA regions.","Adjusted diluted EPS of $1.16 in the quarter grew by 23.5% excluding currency. Our performance in the quarter was flattered by a favorable comparison versus the challenging first quarter of 2014. As we have mentioned previously, the second half of the year will include incremental spending primarily behind the deployment of iQOS.","Strong pricing was the key driver of our financial performance. Our quarterly pricing variance reached $552 million and included a gain from inventories that we were able to build in Korea prior to the recent tax change. Importantly, our first quarter pricing was strong across all four regions. We\u2019re well positioned to achieve a full year pricing variance broadly in line with our historical annual average of approximately $1.8 billion.","Our results were supported by solid market share gains. We performed very well in our top 30 OCI market, increasing share by 1.2 percentage points to 38.1%. Share growth was flat in 22 of these markets. Our share gains were geographically broad-based and driven by a range of brands, including Marlboro. The brand share grew by 0.1 point in the EU, 0.4 points in EEMA and 0.5 points in Latin America and Canada.","Turning now to our regions, we continued to perform extremely well in EEMA, which was the largest contributor to our strong currency neutral results in the quarter. Regional market share increased by 0.7 points, driven by the success of Parliament, Marlboro and the L&M. We gained share in the key geographies of North Africa, Russia and Saudi Arabia.","Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 13.9% and 24.2%, respectively. This growth was driven by higher pricing notably in Russia, Egypt and the Middle East, and favorable volume mix in nearly all of our markets outside Eastern Europe.","In Russia, our performance was outstanding. We achieved double digit OCI growth, excluding currency, despite the 9.3% decline in cigarette industry volume. Our strong brand portfolio helped drive market share gains and higher local currency unit margins through net pricing.","February quarter to date market share reached 27.7%, an increase of 0.9 share points versus the same period last year. Parliament grew 0.5 points, which drove an increase in our premium segment share of 3.5%. Low-price Bond Street grew by 0.9 points.","Despite significant excise tax driven price increases and the weakening of consumer purchasing power, we have not observed any material shift in price segment trends. However, as I mentioned at the CAGNY Conference in February, the macroeconomic environment in Russia continues to be fragile. We recently announced a further increase in retail selling prices of 4 rubles per pack across the majority of our portfolio, although this will not be reflected in the market until later this quarter.","In the EU region, first quarter cigarette industry volume declined by 1.6%, or an estimated 2.7% after adjusting for favorable trade inventory movements. For the year, we forecast cigarette industry decline of approximately 4% as we expect the recently implemented price increases to impact adult smoker demand over the balance of the year.","We maintained our regional cigarette share momentum in the first quarter with a gain of 0.4 points to 39.6%. This increase reflected share growth in the five largest markets by cigarette industry volume as well as the positive performance of our three largest brands in the region, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield, which all gained share.","We achieved adjusted OCI growth in the EU region of 12.9%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by higher pricing across most markets as well as favorable volume mix notably in Southern Europe. On the same basis, we expect the region to be a positive contributor to PMI\u2019s adjusted OCI growth this year.","I\u2019ll now cover our Asia region beginning with Japan. Cigarette industry volume declined by 13.9% in the first quarter, due mainly to the impact of retail trade and consumer purchases last year in anticipation of the consumption tax-driven retail price increases effective April 1, 2014.","After adjusting for these distortions, the decline was an estimated 3.5%. We forecast an industry decline for the year in the range of 2.5% to 3%, as the trend should improve now that we have the April 2014 price increases.","Our market share increased by 0.1 point in the quarter. However, after adjusting for the aforementioned distortions, it declined moderately, due mainly to the timing of competitive brand launches. We expect our full year share to benefit from the recent roll out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture across all three pillars and strong pipeline of innovation.","In the Philippines, we\u2019ve made further retail price increases at the low end of the market in the first quarter. This has restored positive unit margins in the super-low price segment, while price gaps have narrowed and driven Marlboro\u2019s share growth. We believe that the competitive environment is being improved by the recent introduction of tax spends.","Despite significant price increases in this important market, smoking prevalence has remained stable. The reduction in average daily consumption has been due mainly for adult smokers of brands at the low end of the market. We attribute the decrease in large part to sticker shock following price increases for super-low priced brands of approximately 27% on average since October of last year.","We expect average daily consumption to largely recover as the year unfolds and adult smokers adjust to new price levels. We\u2019re pleased by our positive momentum in the first quarter and are optimistic about the improving OCI outlook in the Philippines.","In Indonesia, first quarter cigarette industry volume grew by 5.9%. Quarterly volume result in the market can be volatile and thus may not be representative of the annual trend. For the year, we forecast growth of approximately 2%. Our market share grew by 0.8 points to 35.4%, mainly due to strong performances in the growing machine-made kretek segment by Dji Sam Soe Magnum and Magnum Blue, as well as our flagship in the segment Sampoerna A.","However, our hand-rolled kretek brands remained under pressure as adult smokers continued to switch to machine-made products. This marked our fourth consecutive quarter of sequential share growth and we\u2019re well positioned for further gains. We recently launched U Bold in the rapidly growing full flavor machine-made kretek segment where we\u2019re currently underrepresented, but are gaining share.","The Indonesian market offers exceptional long term prospects, thanks to its growing adult population and a favorable economic environment. We believe that we are best positioned within our industry to benefit from this trend.","In the Latin America and Canada region, adjusted OCI grew by 35.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by pricing in Argentina, Canada and Mexico. This impressive OCI growth enabled the region to be an important contributor to PMI\u2019s results despite its small relative base. Our share in the region grew by 0.9 points to 38.3%, driven mainly by Marlboro. Argentina and Brazil recorded strong share performances with growth of 1.4 and 2.4 points respectively.","Turning now to our RRP portfolio, the performance of our iQOS pilot launches is in line with or exceeds our expectation. In both Nagoya and Milan sales of key stakes are growing sequentially. More importantly, the launches have provided valuable learnings that are being incorporated into our plans for future roll out and cover areas such as the flagship store concept, the logistics chain, after sales support, channel strategy as well as consumer communication and engagement.","We remain on track to commence national expansion in Japan and Italy as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets later this year. Let me also quickly highlight that we launched the e-vapor product Solaris last month in Spain.","We remain steadfast in our determination to offer an attractive dividend to our shareholders. At the close last Friday, our dividend yield was 5.1%. This was significantly above that of our proxy peer group and 10-year US Treasury notes. It was also well above the dividend yield of our main international tobacco competitors.","In conclusion, we achieved strong currency neutral results in the first quarter, driven by robust business fundamentals that are underpinned by our investments last year. Our superior brand portfolio supported by a superb commercial organization is driving positive market share momentum and strong pricing.","We continue to focus vigorously on our cost and for 2015 anticipate the total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%. The iQOS pilot launches are performing well and we\u2019re on track with our plans for national expansion and additional launches later this year. We\u2019re managing our cash flow prudently in order to provide a generous dividend and an attractive yield.","Despite our free cash flow decline in the first quarter, due mainly to currency and temporary working capital movements, we forecast 2015 free cash flow to be broadly in line with last year\u2019s level.","Overall, we\u2019re off to an excellent start in 2015 and are optimistic of our business outlook. We\u2019re raising our 2015 reported diluted EPS guidance which on a currency neutral basis reflects a growth rate of 9% to 11% versus 2014 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02.","Thank you. And I\u2019ll now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Just I\u2019d say two questions for you. If I can ask the first one, as you saw the better volume performance here in the first quarter, even excluding the inventory movements, it was much better than I expected. Do you think this is going to hold for the year? Do you have an updated forecast for the industry overall? Are there areas of certain regions where you\u2019re seeing this improvement maybe more than others and just curious how much that can hold through the year?","Jacek Olczak","As we said in the remarks that we expect the EU to be above the 4%. There are very strong volumes in the EU in the first quarter. Obviously, as you\u2019ve noticed, also in our remarks we said there were some movements in \u2013 held by some inventory movements associated with the last quarter closure of the factory in Holland, which is the main supplier, but still excluding for those movements, I think we had a strong start.","I think in a view of the pricing which we\u2019re taking in EU, I think is prudent at this stage to hold that for a cusp of 4%, but we see \u2013 as with volume momentum in a number of markets, very importantly Southern Europe, but also other markets. And the rest of the world, I think general for the full year, the outlook is that the industry volume should be better than last year.","It\u2019s difficult very precisely to quantify now, but we could feel that volumes in the EEMA region, Asia, Latin America, there\u2019s more of the structural improvement going forward. So I think we remain optimistic about the volume outlook for the full year for the industry and obviously for us.","Chris Growe","And just a follow on question in relation to your earnings guidance for the year, you had a much stronger first quarter performance than I think a lot of us had modeled and I\u2019m sure what you\u2019ve modeled as well. So I\u2019m just curious with the increase in guidance for the year being less than the first quarter earnings be, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s an incremental level of reinvestment, is there some conservatism built in, just how you look at the rest of the year and some of the areas you could use this flexibility to reinvest?","Jacek Olczak","I think the investment plan in terms of cost which we plan to spend for this year, I mean, the pricing of tax rate as per the plan, so I don\u2019t think at this stage that we need to go back and reinvest. The brands and the commercial organization is well invested, the proper resources are allocated behind iQOS, that\u2019s obviously going to be a second part of the year, end of Q3, more Q4 type of a spend. So this will impact obviously our results in the quarters.","As I said, yes, the first quarter was somehow hedged by the inventory and as I mentioned Korea pricing, so this boosted the better performance. But even if I were to exclude this inventory movements and the Korea one-off pricing, we would have a very strong double digit growth in the quarter. We don\u2019t see at this stage that we need to go and to change our investment plan. As you noticed, we reconfirmed that we expect the total cost base ex RRP to stay in the range of 1% ex currency obviously. But we\u2019re pretty confident that we will fund it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","My first question is your Q1, it was clearly very strong, but I guess I was hoping you could maybe summarize what are the key items that give you the confidence to raise your full year guidance so early in the year?","Jacek Olczak","I think the confidence is coming \u2013 I mean, the one-offs which took place in Q1, I mean, they were all well estimated by us in the original guidance. I think this underlying momentum continuing from the last year which gives you more confidence that you can raise the guidance. So even as I said before, even exclude Korea and some inventory distortion, the underlying business in the EU but also in EEMA very much, as I give you that support, in your thinking, in your estimates for the full year, which prompted us to increase the guidance by $0.05.","Nothing what we have been working on very hard last year, since that this was a temporary type of a solution, I mean, the permanent improvements in Philippines, we hold the share in Japan despite some blips in the quarter, EU is continuously delivering. So I mean the things that we spend our time and our efforts in the organization last year properly, so I think we build a solid base for this year. This is what it is.","Bonnie Herzog","And then in terms of Marlboro, your volume has rebounded and were strong in the quarter, so I was hoping you could drill down a little more on this, especially in light of your Marlboro 2.0 roll out? And then I\u2019d like to hear from you how sustainable you think this is.","Jacek Olczak","Marlboro, as I said it on a number of occasions I think CAGNY, at the CAGE most recently, Marlboro is in a good shape. I mean, I think the way we improve the equity of the brand over the last two or so years, helped by the commercial [indiscernible] Marlboro Gold, now going to Marlboro 2.0 Architecture, I mean, all these components, I think, the things together, and Marlboro is responding in a number of geographies, it\u2019s not just one or two places where we see the Marlboro uptake.","The Marlboro 2.0 is just at this stage roll out in about 48 markets and we foresee that by the year end we should be in about 100, a bit more than 100 markets. So that\u2019s an effort which we\u2019ll continue. So I think Marlboro is receiving continued support in terms of Marlboro 2.0, plus market by market with a pipeline of innovations which is going to hit also later the year the market. So I\u2019m confident about the Marlboro performance this year.","Bonnie Herzog","And then just my final question is on your RRP portfolios, first on iQOS, I was hoping you could talk further about some of the learnings you mentioned. And then second on Solaris, given the vapor slowdown, why was the timing right to roll out Solaris?","Jacek Olczak","Maybe I\u2019ll start with Solaris, I think I mentioned this before. The reason we went with Solaris into the market first, I think the Altria product is compared to what you have available in the market, a very good product. And more importantly for us is also to go and test and learn how they\u2019re selling the cigarettes, how a commercial organization should be adjusted, how you handle the trade, the supply chain, the communication with consumers, et cetera. I think before you start engaging larger geographies it\u2019s just simply smart to go and test the waters in a more contained geographies, in this case Spain, and apply this learning which should greatly help us with the resource management going forward.","Now, coming back to the iQOS, look, as I said, whatever we see \u2013 obviously there are differences between Milan and Nagoya and the differences are driven by the distribution spread, as much outlets handling iQOS in Milan than in Nagoya, there is a big difference in the communication possibilities, marketing possibilities, it\u2019s much more open and broader reach which we can get in Japan. Obviously, this is reflected with their awareness levels to start which are about twice as high in Nagoya than in Milan.","But if I drill it down to the number of consumers who have already purchased iQOS and the acceptance levels, how many have already adopted iQOS as a permanent product, as a main product, how many still are in between using about half of an iQOS, half of a combustible cigarette, and obviously there is a growth which using iQOS very rarely, occasionally and still stays with a combustible cigarette, this results are at least as far, if not better, which [indiscernible].","So if you go back to our test results, which I think we showed with investors during the Investor Day last year, we\u2019re showing well above the 30% or above 35% adoption, I mean, the full adoption of iQOS today among those who have purchased it. And as I indicated, the uptake volume of the HeatSticks is in a continuous growth.","I can\u2019t remember how many weeks essentially since the launch, we can observe the sequential growth in HeatSticks. But obviously, adoption takes time, this is a new technology, it\u2019s not something which the consumers are so broadly familiar, so it\u2019s a lot of work to be done. But we\u2019re very enthusiastic and optimistic based on the result which we see in this market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","First, I just want to clarify two things you said earlier, you mentioned that if you were to exclude the Korea pricing benefit and the inventory timing issues in the EU, you still would have had double digit constant currency growth, that\u2019s in EPS, not operating income, correct?","Jacek Olczak","Yeah, that\u2019s correct. This is on EPS.","Matthew Grainger","And the volume impact should be, to whatever extent there is a reversal of that, that should be concentrated in the second quarter?","Jacek Olczak","From the volumes, actually as much as they\u2019re related to the typical timing differences between Q1 and Q2, which is mainly associated with the timing of the Easter holiday in various geographies, I think most of the volume are locked in Q1 and you will not have that, we shouldn\u2019t have an impact of those volumes going into Q2.","Matthew Grainger","And then just two market-specific questions. On Asia first, could you just give us an update on market in competitive conditions in Australia? I know you called out positive share, but what are you seeing in terms of the industry volume reaction to the latest excise tax increases and the pricing headwinds that you faced in the market there?","Jacek Olczak","Due to the excise tax increase in the industry, we increased the prices, so there was a net price increase. Maybe it\u2019s too early to call it, but I think what we can see in Australia at least for the first two months of current trading conditions is that the dynamics of the segment growth, mainly the discount segment, have somehow slowed down. I wouldn\u2019t call it a success, but if I compare sequential quarter development last year versus if I take the Q3, very much Q4 and the beginning of the year, you could see some stabilization or signs of stabilizations in terms of growth of the discount segment. So that\u2019s obviously very helpful.","I think this is a result of maybe a different pricing, maybe per discounting strategies adopted by the players. So yes, I think we\u2019re growing our share, share in the quarter was somehow flattered by the comps because we had the opening of the last year, but I think that Australia for 2015, I mean, it clearly is less of the size of the drag which we had last year. So I think we slowly, month by month, we are moving there in the right direction.","Matthew Grainger","One last question just on Japan, this is lots of areas of strength in the quarter, this is one where performance still seems a bit soft. I was surprised to see your volume still down double digits since you didn\u2019t seemingly have the same inventory benefit last year that your competitors did. How does the double digit decline compare to how you see consumption on your brands during the quarter and is it just the roll out of 2.0 that gives you confidence that things improved through the year?","Jacek Olczak","As far as inventory, I think our shipments in the first quarter was just better than the total market. I think you could see these distortions which we had in Q1 last year somehow clearing \u2013 was cleared in Q1 of this year. Now, frankly speaking, the marginal share movement in Japan knowing that the market is very sensitive on a short term basis, like quarterly basis, the pipelining of the product with the competition for the new product introductions, I wouldn\u2019t pay that much attention.","We\u2019re watching obviously the situation closely, but I think Japan has enough of the initiatives, including Marlboro 2.0, but also a pipeline of our new products to the market that we should see the share coming stronger in other part of the year. So I personally, we don\u2019t think that this quarterly reading from Japan is a red slot which we should we worried about.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","I guess a few questions on Russia, number one, just in terms of clarification on the inventory movement, is it your expectation that that was really \u2013 and I think you maybe talked about this on the context of the total company impact, but in 2Q, does the inventory movement in Q1 help come out in 2Q for Russia?","Jacek Olczak","No, I think the inventory adjustments in Russia, I think, they just corrected, the inventories at the distributor level which is more corresponding to the outlook for the total market and more importantly for the share which we have in Russia. So maybe there are some smaller distortions of this shipment, but I don\u2019t think anything of the magnitude which we should expect, nor this was a payback from the last year. I think it\u2019s just the normal course of the business, however, this was more connected with that recovering of recouping the inventories to the right level.","Judy Hong","And then just maybe underlying trend in Russia, just what you\u2019re seeing in terms of the elasticity to the price increases that happened in December, the fact that you\u2019re taking another pricing, does that imply that the impact on volume has been more favorable? And in the context of just competitive environment, obviously you\u2019re gaining a lot of market share, what do you anticipate in terms of how the competitive dynamics play out in that market?","Jacek Olczak","Look, I think so far if you look at the current performance of the business and the way we look at the industry, I think the market holds very well. I mean, obviously, you have a high 9% sort of the volume declines for the total industry, but this has to be read in comparisons to the very high pricing the industry is taking, or we\u2019re taking. So the elasticity is so far okay.","We have this disconnect in terms of the macros reading from Russia, but as I mentioned, we looked very carefully into the price segments that will augment over the very recent period. And you essentially have to split in total to start concluding that you have acceleration of growth of the bottom of the market or down trading et cetera. Not at this stage, but as I said, Russia is something which presumably will remain on the watch list for the full year.","Having our share growth and pricing, we grew our share for Parliament, so clearly this is not just share in the premium or above premium segment, other brands obviously contributed as well. We just announced another price increase. As you know, Russia on an ex currency looks very good. Obviously, currency has put a dent on the results, that\u2019s very clear. And inflation is high and I think this was the reason why we decided to go now with the price. But so far, elasticity is working as per the expectations, we\u2019re talking 3.4 type elasticity if you take the price increases versus the market decline.","Judy Hong","And then just lastly on the yen hedging, can you just update on where you are today versus the last guidance you\u2019ve given?","Jacek Olczak","Judy, we usually don\u2019t update what we do with regards to the hedging during a year. I can just maybe help you that if I take a $1.15 impact on our results with the previous guidance, I\u2019ll confirm today in the $1.15, yen just moves in that guidance by $0.01. I said a $0.13 impact last guidance, and I have now $0.14 impact this guidance. So this is not the yen, clearly I think the hedge in place, they\u2019re all in that same, but also I have to admit volatility on the yen is lower than we used to have it at the beginning of the period.","Ruble, which I listed in my remarks, improved a lot, because the ruble is just $0.13 now in my guidance and it used to be $0.48, so this is a big improvement. Swiss francs was negative and turned positive in the guidance to $0.10. And there is a whole list of other currencies, obviously euro plays a role, but the yen was \u2013 yen played just a one role. Ruble was $0.35 in the guidance, 30% of the entire guidance is the major contributor to that balancing and us holding the $1.15 guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery","I just wanted to come back to Korea. You talked about the benefit from the inventory, I assume by that you mean that you were able to pull inventory ahead of January 1 so that you could sell product in this quarter with last year\u2019s lower tax, is that correct?","Jacek Olczak","That\u2019s correct.","Michael Lavery","And how long does that benefit last? Is the shelf life typically it\u2019s close to six months maybe, will that benefit continue in 2Q or have you exhausted that inventory yet?","Jacek Olczak","It\u2019s very much a function of how long your inventories you manage to be, obviously there are some limitations, some restrictions in the market, how much you can be, so we don\u2019t have a free ride on this one. But I think mostly that benefit, at least in our case, should be attributed to the Q1, mostly, there might be some slip over going to Q2, but it\u2019s mostly a Q1 event.","Michael Lavery","And then just looking at your guidance obviously you\u2019re much more confident and it is early, how much volumes are far less predictable, but how much of the pricing that you're expecting that's reflected in your guidance, have you already realized or been able to take?","Jacek Olczak","Because we\u2019re a bit deeper in the year, we usually at this year don\u2019t give a number how much the pricing we have realized, but you might remember and initial guidance in February when we were announcing full year results, we have said that for the current 2015 year, we have 70% pricing realization. And there were a number of markets which we have taken the pricing since then. So clearly we are higher than 70%.","Michael Lavery","So you can't say by how much?","Jacek Olczak","No. For competitive reasons, et cetera, I can\u2019t.","Michael Lavery","Okay, that's fine. Then just on Egypt, you called out higher manufacturing costs that came from the new business structure, but you also talked about favorable impacts from the new business structure as well. Can you just give a little summary of the puts and takes there and how that nets out?","Jacek Olczak","That\u2019s the impact which we are carrying from Q2 last year \u2013 actually from mid of Q1 last year. So this is a quarter where we\u2019re lapping that thing, so with very marginally, but still had an impact in Q1. It doesn\u2019t impact your bottom line very much other than organic growth in the business, it just impacts that your revenues are slightly up and your costs are slightly up versus how we were reporting reflecting our business structure in 2013. So we\u2019re comparing 100% apples to apples.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","My first question has to do with EU profitability. You guys have previously indicated that you expect to generate local currency profit growth in the EU given the strong start to the year and I recognize you have the offset later on on the national launch of iQOS, but can you give us a better sense of how strongly profits might inflect in the EU?","Jacek Olczak","Clearly, we\u2019ve had a good start of the year, so that \u2013 obviously the different pace is going to continue for the Q2, Q3, because there was an underlying strength coming from top line. I think initially for the year, I think we said that we expect EU to contribute in the low single digit. I think I\u2019m definitely confident that they can achieve this one. So let me make the statement at this stage.","Vivien Azer","In terms of the rollout of iQOS later on in the year you noted the potential for other pilots and\/or national launches. Can you give us a little bit more color on what you're looking for in order to make a determination around that? Is it an accommodative regulatory landscape from a tax perspective, is it supply chain, just any other color around that would be helpful?","Jacek Olczak","Clearly we\u2019re looking into the market which give us the volume and margin opportunity, so for obvious reasons, I can\u2019t share with you today the details. But as I said, it\u2019s the consumer base, it\u2019s our position in the market, it\u2019s the margin structure, so these are the key components which we\u2019re looking into. We have said from the very beginning that initially we will go to the market where the margins will be rather accretive to the rest of our business.","Vivien Azer","And my last question, any comment or update on Platform 2, please?","Jacek Olczak","Platform 2, we started [indiscernible] in Spain \u2013 sorry, Platform 2 \u2013 Solaris, Platform 2 goes on plan. So it\u2019s nothing really to update versus what we have said before.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Bill Marshall of Barclays Capital.","Bill Marshall","I just had one quick question for you. So I believe on earlier calls you guys have kind of left the door open for share repurchases this year. It sounds like from your comments earlier that's probably off the table for 2015. So I was just wondering in the context of your very strong quarter what kind of milestones could you point to that would make you feel more comfortable about buying back stock as we look forward maybe past 2015 into 2016.","Jacek Olczak","Look, we have not updated, unfortunately, we\u2019re not in a position to update the currency guidance and this is the component or element which impact our reported numbers and cash flow very much, okay. So buyback or suspension of the buyback for this year is the outcome of that. I mean, we\u2019ll have to see the improvement in the currency outlook is very much [indiscernible] versus all others to be able to go back to that share buyback.","So yes, obviously the guidance increase \u2013 the outlook for the year increase helps, but this is still, I have to admit, overshadowed by the strong negative currency which we are confronted this year. So we need to wait, what\u2019s going to happen with the currencies in order to take back the discussion on the \u2013 come back to the discussion on buyback.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I\u2019ll now return the call to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you do have follow-up questions, the Investor Relations team will be here in Switzerland and available.

And welcome to the Philip Morris International First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 first quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?","Martin King","Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We are off to a promising start in 2019, reflecting positive momentum for our combustible tobacco and smoke-free product portfolios; strong currency-neutral adjusted financial results, and the important milestone of reaching over 10 million IQOS users globally.","As we announced in our press release this morning, we are revising our 2019 reported diluted earnings per share guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.87. The $0.03 revision compared to our prior guidance on March 22nd of at least $4.90 is due to two specific factors. First, a $0.02 increase in the estimated net impact of the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Incorporated, RBH, representing a total charge of approximately $0.12 per share based on final quarter-end figures. And second, asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $0.01 per share related to a plant closure in Pakistan as part of our global manufacturing footprint optimization.","Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share with essentially the entire amount or $0.13 coming in the first half of the year. After excluding the $0.22 per share of reporting adjustments outlined on this slide, our forecast represents a projected currency-neutral increase of at least 8% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.84 in 2018.","For the year, we continue to anticipate a total industry volume decline for cigarettes and heated tobacco units of approximately 2.5% to 3%. Furthermore, on a like-for-like basis adjusting for the deconsolidation of RBH, we maintained the following full-year assumptions; a total PMI shipment volume decline of 1.5% to 2%; currency-neutral net revenue growth of at least 5%; currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion of at least 100 basis points; operating cash flow of approximately $9.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements; and capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion.","Turning now to the first quarter. We recorded a total shipment volume increase of 1.1%, driven by the strong growth of heated tobacco units, notably in the EU Region and Russia. Our cigarette shipment volume was stable, supported by growth from each of our top-five international cigarette brands. Excluding the net unfavorable impact of estimated distributor inventory movements, our total in-market sales volume grew by 1.7% with heated tobacco units up by nearly 35%. Importantly, our HTU in-market sales volume increased by 10.6% sequentially versus the fourth quarter, reaching nearly 13 billion units.","Net revenues increased by 3.2%, excluding currency, driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing from our combustible tobacco portfolio. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth came despite two challenging comparisons versus the first quarter of 2018.","The first relates to sizable IQOS device shipments in Japan last year following the lifting of device sales restrictions. This is evidenced by the contribution of devices to our total RRP net revenues of approximately 22% in the first quarter of 2019 compared to approximately 35% in the same period last year. The second relates to the shift to highly inflationary accounting in Argentina, effective July 1, 2018, with the U.S. dollar now serving as the functional currency for our subsidiaries in Argentina and the impact of the peso devaluation now included in our currency-neutral results.","Combined, these two items represented an estimated drag of approximately 3.4 percentage points on our currency-neutral net revenue growth rate. Absent which, our growth would have been approximately 6.6% consistent with our full-year assumption of at least 5%.","Our combustible pricing variance in the quarter was nearly 4%, and was adversely impacted by a partial excise tax absorption in Turkey and the aforementioned accounting shift in Argentina. The underlying fundamentals supporting our strong historic pricing remain intact, notably the broadly rational excise tax environment globally and our leading cigarette brand portfolio. We have recently increased our cigarette prices in markets, such as France, Germany, Italy, Mexico and Turkey, which should further contribute to a positive pricing variance over the balance of the year. For the full-year, we anticipate a combustible pricing variance above 5%.","On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 9.1% and adjusted operating income margin increased by 200 basis points. Compared to the first quarter of last year, these metrics benefited from the lower device shipments noted earlier in my remarks given their dilutive unit margins. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15%, excluding currency, driven by our strong business performance, coupled with the favorable impact of a lower effective tax rate and lower interest expense.","Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S., increased by 1 percentage point in the first quarter to reach 28.4%. Half of this growth was driven by heated tobacco units, reflecting broad-based share gains across markets where IQOS has been commercialized. Our cigarette portfolio contributed the balance of the growth, despite the impact of out-switching to heated tobacco products, with higher share in markets such as Egypt, Germany, Thailand and Turkey. Importantly, our share of the cigarette category alone increased by 0.7 percentage points to 27.1%. Our total international share growth was driven by higher share in five of our six regions. The decline in the East Asia & Australia Region mainly reflected the impact of lower cigarette share in Japan and Korea.","Moving now to RRPs, we reached a key milestone in the quarter, surpassing 10 million IQOS users. Importantly, approximately 70% of the total have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion.","In Japan, we are seeing encouraging trends in IQOS device ownership, IQOS past-seven-day use, heated tobacco category share and our HTU off-take share, as evidenced by the three-month moving average figures presented on this slide. These trends suggest that the range of initiatives for restoring share growth that we initially outlined last May and introduced during the second half of the year are indeed starting to pay-off. And while we anticipate increased competitive activity in the category over the course of this year, this could actually serve to accelerate category growth.","Our share for HeatSticks and HEETS in Japan reached 16.9% in the first quarter, or 16.6% after adjusting for estimated trade inventory movements. This marked our first sequential share growth since the first quarter of 2018, and is the highest quarterly share that we have achieved in the market. Importantly, as shown on this slide, the sequential growth of the heated tobacco category in Japan in the first quarter was driven primarily by our HTU brands.","In Korea, where the heated tobacco category continues to be highly competitive, our market share over recent quarters has been distorted by the impact of inventory movements, which we initially noted during our full-year earnings call in February. On an adjusted basis, the share of HEETS remained stable sequentially at an estimated 7.8%. In the EU Region, HEETS continued its sequential share growth, increasing by 0.4 percentage points to reach 2.1%. The growth was driven by essentially all IQOS markets and reflects success across a broad range of countries with varying regulatory frameworks and adult smoker preferences. It is worth noting that the government in Italy recently lowered the excise tax for innovative smoke-free products, such as heated tobacco and e-cigarettes. As a result, effective April 5th, we adjusted the retail price of HEETS to \u20ac4.50, in line with the lowest price point for cigarettes. We believe that this is an important step to help accelerate the transition to a smoke-free future.","HEETS also continued its strong performance in Russia, with national share up by 1.3 percentage points sequentially to reach 3.1%. The increase was flattered by the impact on the total market of seasonally lower cigarette industry volume. Given this effect, we believe that the in-market sales volume progression with sequential growth of over 30% in the first quarter provides a more realistic indicator of the brand's trajectory.","Our in-market sales growth mainly reflects the progress of our local organization in existing IQOS focused geographies; the impact of positive word-of-mouth from the growing number of IQOS users; our omni-channel strategy; and further geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in 35 cities, representing an estimated 32% of the market by total industry volume.","As noted during our earnings call in February, our HEETS shipments exceeded their in-market sales in the fourth quarter of last year, driven by our planned geographic expansion. While this contributed to an unfavorable impact on our HTU shipments of approximately 600 million units in the first quarter, it had no material effect on our in-market sales volume or market share.","In conclusion, we are off to a promising start to the year. The fundamentals supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio remain intact. Favorable momentum for IQOS across geographies, including Japan is driving HTU share gains and further supports our confidence in our HTU shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021. Finally, on a like-for-like basis, we are on track to deliver against our full-year currency-neutral net revenue growth assumptions of at least 5% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth forecast of at least 8%.","Thank you. I am now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","So I guess it's nice to see Japan getting back on the growth track for IQOS. If you can share your observation about IQOS 3 and multi-performing in that country, and then maybe contrast that with Korea perhaps where it seems like share trends have been flattish. So why is Japan doing better versus Korea, is my first question.","Martin King","Yes, we're very gratified by the performance in Japan. I think IQOS 3 and multi is playing a role in that. The devices have been very well received by consumers. It helps us turn the page in Japan on the reliability issue we had with the previous early versions of 2.4 plus, even though 2.4 plus is now fixed from a reliability point of view in consumers' minds in Japan, this was part of what they were looking for was to get past that. And it's definitely helping us with perceptions in the marketplace. Our new registrations in Japan have increased substantially, and it's in part due to the 3 and multi that's there. HEETS is playing a role as well. And the roll out during the quarter was successful. It's adding to our share and adding to profitability in the market as it brings in the price sensitive consumers from cigarettes.","So the plan in Japan is as we had hoped and it's right on track and doing very well. In Korea, the issue is very intense competition in the heat-not-burn category. We're holding our own but we're seeing some new offerings from competition. And there's some churn going on there, not unlike happened in the earlier days also in Japan. And we're working very hard, the 3 and multi are well received in the country, but we're still working through I think some of the competitive activity that's going on in that marketplace.","Judy Hong","Okay, that's helpful. And then your decision to take pricing down for HEETS in EU, just elaborate on what drove that decision. And then if you can speak to then, how does that impact the profitability outlook for IQOS, HEETS. Are there other offsets that you're looking to drive some of the pricing changes, and why just Europe and not other markets around the world?","Martin King","Well, actually, it was even more specific than Europe, it was in Italy only. And it was because the government reduced the tax. And so we're passing on that benefit to consumers, and we believe that that's the right thing to do. The profitability remains intact. And it's something that as we get better tax differentials in various countries, we think it's important when we get a lower tax to reflect that sometimes in the price, so that consumers benefit. Otherwise, governments are less likely to retain those gaps. ","Judy Hong","And then just my last question. So the first quarter earnings actually came in better than your expectation that you talked about during fourth quarter earnings. So were there any timing factors or is the underlying business actually done better than you expected in the first quarter?","Martin King","Yes, so it's both. There is better underlying business, particularly in the area of EU and the volume on conventional cigarettes came a bit stronger than we anticipated. As far as HTUs, we're right on plan but about -- if you take the beat being about $0.09, $0.03 is the currency coming better, which is transactional currency. Then there is about $0.06 that's more in the business and half of that is better underlying performance and the other half is more spending timing that I think will flush out in the coming quarters. So we're on a good start for the year but it's early days and we will see how the rest of the year unfolds.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","I guess I'd like to ask the same question again from Judy. Can you explain just a little bit, because I think in the last six quarters, you've given guidance for quarterly EPS 4 times. [Indiscernible] some extraordinary - by large amount. And I'm just wondering how we should interpret that, maybe because fundamentally the business is not hugely unpredictable, and we just have four lucky results in a row? Or is there some other explanation? And I suppose given that, how conservative are you being for the full-year?","Martin King","Well, I mean, we are off to a strong start for the year and it's reflected, as I said, in the business results that you see. We have good margins. We have good volume. But it's early days. I mean, we're here in the first quarter only. For the heated tobacco space, we're right on plan in Japan that is very nice share growth but it's what we planned. In EU, it's turning out really nicely. It's everything developing well. We're getting the benefit from the investments that we made last year. But it's exactly what we had anticipated and put in the plan. The part that\u2019s a bit further ahead of where we anticipated, is the conventional cigarette volume, which is coming both from the total market, which on adjusted basis total market worldwide was down 2.3, so it's very much to the low end of the range we expected. And our own share is coming quite strong as well on conventional cigarettes to be up in share despite the impacts of cannibalization from HTUs is a welcome development. Now, we'll have to see if these trends hold and it's really the beginning of the year. We give the best estimates we can and I think it's a positive that we're seeing the business performing a bit better.","Adam Spielman","Can I ask two questions that perhaps you can answer specific. First of all, I was very surprised to see I think 31% organic adjusted operating income growth in the EU. As I've read the press release, that was mainly driven by pricing in Germany, Italy and Poland. But is there any other factors that you can point to, because that\u2019s a huge increase 31% on what should be quite a stable market?","Martin King","Well, there're two other factors. One is the total market in EU came better than it has for a while, and pretty good for EU to be only down slightly. And our share is doing very well for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units. And then you get this factor that our volume our shipments in EU for heated tobacco units are starting to get quite significant. And you have to remember that our margins on those shipments are considerably better than cigarettes. So you get both the weighting of HTUs at a higher margin and you get better trends on the volume for both cigarettes and heated tobacco units. We're also getting more efficient on our spending. We made significant investments in infrastructure and we've learned how to better convert smokers to the heated tobacco to IQOS, and do it more efficiently and effectively.","So if you look at our cost, the step up across all the regions actually but in the EU, it was much smaller this year than it was last year, and we're benefiting from the investments we made before. We're also scrubbing our costs on the other existing areas in the company as we're committed to doing and we're doing a better job controlling the costs, so all those come in together to give some pretty good results.","Adam Spielman","And I think from your comments that there's been no impact that you can see from JUUL. I guess, the question behind the question is back in I guess November, December, when we discovered they would go international, we thought that there was a risk with JUUL, which hit volumes perhaps in the UK, perhaps in Canada, which I suppose we no longer talk about, perhaps in Germany. But I guess the impression it had no impact that you can see.","Martin King","That's correct. We haven't seen any impact from JUUL in any country on our volume\u2026","Adam Spielman","And the final question from me is you've highlighted as I said particularly in the EU very good operating growth. Is there any factors you'd highlight in the rest of the year that maybe cause it to fall in perhaps the way that's not obvious for the informed onlooker? Or should we just extrapolate this very good performance in Europe going forward?","Martin King","Well, I can't think of any event to call out that would cause performance to falter in any way. I don't know that you'll see the same percentage increase each quarter going forward because there're other factors involved. But the trajectory and the trends I think are good. And yes, I believe EU will have a good year this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","You touched on the advantages that the heated tobacco units have in Europe compared to cigarettes. Can you give a sense we have a little bit of color on a couple of markets, like Italy and Germany. I guess two questions. One, are they somewhat representative of the EU broadly? And then second, in Italy with the lower taxes and also the lower price. Does your economic advantage increased at all with that lower price or is it constant? How does your price adjustment and with the tax adjustment compared to where you would've been prior to that?","Martin King","Well, Italy and Germany probably overall have slightly higher margins for heated tobacco units than most of the other countries. They both have a pretty good advantage from a tax perspective, Germany particularly so. As far as the price increase, I mean we've passed those tax advantages on the consumer and our profitability is at least as good as it was before.","Michael Lavery","And just looking at the pricing variances that you cited. First, am I right just that that is pricing and it doesn't reflect the mix, for example, revenue mix lift from heated tobacco units? And if that's correct, do you have a sense of how much mix benefit you get from the growth of the HeatSticks as part of the -- the bigger part of the portfolio?","Martin King","Yes, the pricing that was mentioned in the script was reflecting conventional cigarette pricing over conventional cigarettes revenue. We do of course get a mix benefit as we grow heated tobacco units. If you look at mix companywide, it's a little more complicated, because we also have the effect of geographic volume differences that\u2019s higher or lower margin. So for example, if Turkey grows volume is what happened in the first quarter this year that tends to be at a lower margin than the volume, in say EU that we mentioned before. So that factor comes into the mix as well. So companywide mix is not so clear. But overall, there is a mix benefit absolutely as we grow the heated tobacco unit volumes around the world, because everywhere that we commercialize we have higher margins on heated tobacco units in the cigarettes in that same given market.","Michael Lavery","And again just over and above the pricing that you call out for\u2026","Martin King","Well, the pricing for the year, it's going to vary. Overall, the main takeaway is that the pricing conditions are intact the pricing power is still there, the brands are strong, you see that in the share gains. So we are very encouraged by the pricing environment. It does vary. You have the number of factors going on in this quarter. For instance, Argentina being out of the pricing variance that reduces it significantly in the second half of the year the comparison will be better. In Turkey, we absorbed tax in the first quarter. We've now taken pricing in Turkey recently. Russia, there is a tax timing difference. The tax increase was in January this year whereas in Russia, it was in July.","So the comparison for the first half year is more difficult. And then there are some countries like Philippines, for example, where we had very nice pricing last year, but it was more a issue of closing the gap from the JTI acquiring the Mighty brands and the crude tax, excise tax being fully reflected in the price, so that close price gaps in the market last year and even starting the year before. So we had very nice pricing as that catch-up occurred, returning more the pricing that should be in the market. And so the comparison against this year, while we continue to have good pricing variance and we anticipate still to have a good pricing variance in the Philippines, it's not nearly as big as it was last year, so all these factors come into play. On top of that we just took the pricing in France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Turkey. And we're going to keep looking for pricing opportunities as we go forward. So we are confident we'll be over the 5% to the part of the year, and it's pretty good pricing environment overall.","Michael Lavery","And then can you just touch on the competitive environment for heated tobacco in Japan, there's been some new product launches obviously you're still growing there or even picking up versus where you were last year. What have you seen from any of the competitive initiatives, is it too early to really have a read? Or what's the right way to characterize the competitive dynamics there now?","Martin King","Well, right now we're the ones growing as we showed you on the chart. We were driving the category growth and taking pretty much almost all of that growth into IQOS related consumables. Now, there are some new products that have been launched but very limited amounts, so it\u2019s hard to see how they're going to do. And then later in the year, probably in the October time period or so is what we understand from competitors that they're planning to launch some additional products, which has combined effects. One positive from it is it could very well help accelerate the category growth.","One of the problems we called out in the past in Japan is as consumers try other products in the heat-not-burn space, in many cases they've been disappointed and dropped out of the category as opposed to being satisfied by the products and staying with it. So IQOS still has by far in a way the best conversion rates of anything out there. We'll see if these additional launches or products, which people can convert to more readily. But I think we're still confident that we'll have the best product in the marketplace based on everything we know today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen.","Vivien Azer","So sticking with the theme of competition in Asia. Can you just elaborate a little bit on the competitive activity that you cited in South Korea. Any color around relative price points of commercial activity would be helpful. Thank you.","Martin King","Well, the price points on the consumables are pretty much clustered around the 4,500 three and one per pack. I think there's maybe one competitor has slightly lower price. The differences on the devices though is larger, IQOS 3 and multi are priced at a premium versus most of the other devices. But the bigger driver I think is on the consumable side. In Korea, there's very little price tiering, as well as the whole market mostly clustered around that same -- including cigarettes by the way, clustered around that same 4,500 per pack price.","Vivien Azer","So given the limited price variance on the consumable, is it your understanding or your belief that its larger variance on the hardware that's driving the heightened competitive activity in your sequential share loss. Is it differences in flavor variance?","A - Martin King","Well, first of all, our share is stable. I mean you're getting some distortions in the reported number from the effects of the graphical health warning volume that was shipped in the fourth quarter last year that we had called out and you're paying it back in the first quarter. Our in-market sales share adjusted for those effects is stable at 7.8%. So we're holding our own that's the good news. We do recognize that we need to continue to broaden our availability of different SKUs. In South Korea, there is a very big role for different flavors and you see that on the cigarette side, but you also see it on the heated tobacco unit side. And we do have a number of different flavors in our SKU lineup, but we continue to look at opportunities to broaden that lineup and we'll work to be competitive across that space as well.","Vivien Azer","And just second question on IQOS in U.S., we've heard from the FDA that there will be some resolution on your application by the end of the year. Can you just remind us when we'll hear a last engagement with the agency, what was the nature of the discussion any specific topics that were raised? Thanks.","Martin King","Well, we continue to expect an answer or a decision anytime. In the past, we have gotten various questions on the application, we've always answered them right away and we're continuing to expect to hear from them and hopefully, we'll be able to get off and running with IQOS in the U.S., sometime this year. But I don't have any real update on the timing or any further insight other than the same comments that you probably read from the TMA that were on the news.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","I wanted to circle back to Japan and IQOS. A lot of discussion this morning, and your in-market sales increased nicely but your shipment volume was down year-over-year and sequentially. And I know this was due to distributor inventory movements. But I guess I was hoping you could drill down just a little further on this, and maybe walk through some of the key dynamics for us of what's going on there. And then really how we should think about shipments versus inventory build for the remainder of the year in that important market?","Martin King","Yes, you're right. It was impacted by inventory change, which is about 0.7 billion sticks. So if you look at in-market sales, it was about $6.4 billion. Now, remember we've had a price increase in Japan and the market is impacted by that. So you have about a 4.5% to 5% market decline coming from the -- the usual market decline, plus the impact of the pricing that occurred in October. So you have to keep that in mind when you're comparing pure volume going back. So despite the very nice share gain that we're experiencing now, the actual in-market sales volume is not as up as much as you might expect, because the total market is declining as of course, it is across all the categories and all the different brands. So I don't know if that answers your question, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","No, that helps. I appreciate that. And then my next question I had was on your plan lowering incremental spend behind IQOS this year. Maybe help us understand how some of the things that you're doing to invest behind this business have changed, or maybe will change versus what you've needed to focus on in the past. I guess, I'm trying to understand where you're at in the cycle in terms of building the business and are you, as you're lowering the spend levels. Again, how are these initiatives changing? And then a second part to that question is margins. On your outlook for margins in '19 or this full year, you mentioned you expect your margins to expand 100 bps. But hoping you could highlight maybe some of the key puts and takes for us? Thanks.","Martin King","First of all, just to be clear on the spend. What I think you're zeroing in on is our step up in net incremental spending, whereas last year, we were about 600 million incremental behind RRP, meaning RRP spend offset by reductions in other areas and shifts, for example, from the CC side and overall cut, versus this year the increment we said it would be about half of that $300 million. That doesn't mean we're not spending behind IQOS and commercial launches and everything else. In fact, our spending really hasn't slowed down. What we're doing is better covering the step up from within our existing cost base. And of course there is also the factor of some of the things we were spending money on last year were for infrastructure that once you have it in place like a digital organization, et cetera, it can scale to much more volume without adding into it.","So there's two factors there, one is, some of the big building blocks being in place and not needing to be increased in line with volume. And the other one is a more focused effort to ring cost out of everywhere we can throughout the business in order to be able to maintain a very steady and significant level of investment behind the transformation and reduced risk products but without adding so much incrementally. And that's helped us with our financial objectives, of course. We called out at Investor Day this initiative to find over $1.1 billion of cost efficiencies across the whole business that includes operations, manufacturing, a number of initiatives we've put in place zero based budgeting approach, which is up and running. We've identified number of initiatives we're starting to apply them.","So you're seeing those benefits coming through in a lower step up in costs. But it doesn't mean we're slowed our investments behind transformation RRP. It's a very deliberate strategy to be able to invest heavily but without having it affect our margins yet and other aspects of the business, and that's what you're seeing. Did that cover that piece of your question on margins?","Bonnie Herzog","Yes.","Martin King","So margins, the 100 basis points improvement is -- part of it is exactly the same discussion. It's slowing the incremental total costs that we're adding, while still benefiting from the increased margin coming from higher volumes of heated tobacco units, especially in the EU where the margins are very attractive. So it's a variety of different pieces there that help us achieve the 100 basis point at least. And you see even in this quarter we were above that, because of the other factors, the cost and the devices, et cetera, being lower. So this is a multiyear focused effort to improve our margins at the same time we invest significantly.","Bonnie Herzog","That was really helpful. And I mean are there any key headwinds we should think about that will put pressure on your margins as you talk about all the positives? I just want to make sure I think if there are any headwinds that you foresee for the rest of the year?","Martin King","I don't see anything right now that would prevent us from achieving this 100 basis point at least objective. We'd always think of some wild thing that would come from that field, I can't think of anything that's likely to happen that would keep us from making that attempt.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","I wanted to better understand IQOS' distribution reach within Europe versus its market share trends. So thinking about individual countries in Europe, I guess what percent of relevant distribution outlets are IQOS in? And how much more opportunity is there for IQOS to expand its distribution range?","Martin King","I believe we are around 50% in Europe, maybe a little higher now, because that's probably little bit of an older number. But the point is we still within Europe and most of the countries in Europe are not truly, truly fully national. And even if the product is available in some places nationally, the initiatives behind converting smokers and the real consumer journey activities, if you will, are more focused still toward the bigger population areas for efficiency reasons and other. So there is room to grow in EU strictly simply from geographic expansion. And it's a substantial amount of space still available for us to do that.","And of course that's true elsewhere as well. Russia we called out is just now with this last expansion that occurred, we are in about a third of the country by volume. Japan and Korea, we are fully national. So those two, there's probably not much room you're going to get from purely geographic expansion. But in just about every other country that we've launched in, we still have geographic expansion opportunities within the country. And of course, we can still over next few years, we'll continue to add countries as it makes sense. So there is plenty of room to grow with this product.","Pamela Kaufman","And then just on Japan, so there is discussion of a potential delay in the consumption tax increase in October. How would that influence your thinking around pricing? And would it preclude you from being able to raise prices in the market, if the tax increase doesn't go through?","Martin King","Well, Pamela, I really can't talk about future pricing. For sure in general, when there is pricing in most countries and in Japan, in particular, it's usually easier to do when there is some sort of an event, either tax increase or VAT increase. It is not impossible to increase prices absent those and we have done it. We did it on Marlboro a couple of years ago. Mevius, we did it independently the year before that. So it's not impossible to have pricing in Japan, absent tax and VAT. But obviously, the event creates the opportunity to be able to do it.","Pamela Kaufman","And just a last question on your expectations for upcoming regulatory developments. Are there other countries where you expect to see changes to favorable tax treatment for heated tobacco? And just an update on plain packaging, any anticipated impacts from the implementation of plain packaging in the Middle East in the coming months?","Martin King","I don't know of any particular situation to call out of expected rollbacks in tax with regard to novel tobacco products. But I mean, we make the case with various governments all the time that the ideal way to think about taxes on tobacco product is along the risk continuum. And if you have cigarettes at say 100% of tax, then you have products that have far lower levels of toxicity and measurable scientifically substantiated benefits that are much, much, much lower than that should be reflected in the tax. So we do make that case. And we have had case situations in other countries where the tax actually improved or the gap improved between cigarettes and heated tobacco units. There are couple of cases actually in the EU. But I can't really call out any going forward, but we'll continue to make the case along those lines.","As far as plain packaging, we have a lot of experience now with plain packaging in a number of different countries. And so far, it really hasn't had any significant impact on volume share or any of the other key metrics. So, we're not worried about the implementation of the plain packaging. I mean, obviously, it's important for us to be able to keep branding and keep the premiumness of our products and so forth. So we don't think that plain packaging is the way to go. But if they're going to implement it on cigarettes, then it's not the end of the world. We haven't seen any big impacts from it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pieter Vorster of Credit Suisse.","Pieter Vorster","Good afternoon, Pieter Vorster from Credit Suisse. Just a quick house-keeping question. Last year in Q1, you made your $80 million annual contribution to the foundation for a smoke free world in Q1. Is the timing the same this year or did you make it this quarter or should we look for it in a different quarter this year?","Martin King","Yes, it was the same timing and we have made the contribution and it's the same as it was last year with the size and the timing.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Radhika Swaminathan of Flowering Tree.","Radhika Swaminathan","Yes, I just wanted to get some of your comments on the Philippines market on the brands. I mean I see some qualitative comments on upgrading. So how's that panning out?","Martin King","I mean, in the Philippines, our share is stable right. We're at flat share but we're growing significantly with our Marlboro share versus Fortune. So we've traded up from mid-price or even low priced brands also from mighty Marlboros and so forth, up in the Marlboro as those price gaps close. So Marlboro is up almost six share points in share from the same period last year, and it's almost 39% share of the market now. Whereas Fortune has dropped by not quite the same amount, but about five share points, which is part -- it's just a function of the gaps, the price gaps closing between the different brands. So, Philippines while our share in volume if you -- our volume was up in the quarter but it's more of a trade loading timing so forth. It's really down slightly overall in the market. And the share is also more or less flat, but the profitability improves as you trade up from a mid-price or low price into the premium. So, Philippines is pretty good story still.","Operator","And our last question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Thanks for the follow-up. I just had one other quick question on platform two. Could you give us any update on the status there?","Martin King","It's pretty much the same as we've communicated before, Michael. We did the test market in the Dominican Republic and we've learned quite a bit on the consumer side. The product is actually well received. It's a product we think will be very successful in the long haul. But we're working on improving the reliability of the product and making sure that charcoal heat source is well secured and won't give us any problems in a broad scale launch. I mean, when you launch in a very big country, you can be shipping billions and billions of units. So even a very, very small rate of dropping off of the heated tip would be of concern so we want to make sure it is absolutely bulletproof and tested and able to stand up in high humidity environments, for example. And also with the new way of attaching the tip and making sure it's right, we need to scale up the manufacturing for it. And that's taking us a little bit of time. So we still have a great deal of confidence in this product, and we believe it will play a role. It will be very nice to have it in a number of markets for more conservative smokers, because the ritual is more similar and we'll get it out there as soon as we can.","Michael Lavery","Do you have a sense of what the timing is for when you could commercialize that more broadly?","Martin King","I really don't have an update right now. We will give it to you when we can.","Michael Lavery","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","And thank you, that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin King","Yes, I just want to summarize a couple of the key points, I think going forward. We're very pleased with the start to the year. We've got very good momentum. The combustible tobacco portfolio, the volumes are very good. I think this is the best volume performance we've had in a very long time. The share is very strong. The pricing remains intact and is doing well. So we're very pleased with the base of the business that is the engine that can feed our growth as we move toward smoke free products. At the same time, the IQOS is doing extremely well across geography. We have Japan growing shared nicely and on a very good trajectory. We're able to grow across pretty much every different type of country and geography and consumer preference, regulatory scheme.","And we're seeing really pretty impressive growth in places like Russia and the EU. We're on track to deliver our long-term targets of 9,200 billion units. And we're also pleased with the financial results in being able to expand margin and have a have a good cost approach. While we're investing in what we need to invest and continuing to see the growth with substantial investments, but at the same time scrubbing our costs and being very cost conscious throughout the business to be able to fund that without as much incremental spending. And we are very pleased to be able to deliver these results and we'll see as the year unfolds, and we continue to have good momentum we're off to a good start. So I think that's the main points to take away. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you very much.","Nick Rolli","Thank you very much. That concludes the call for today.

Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer for the last time on our quarterly earnings calls. As I\u2019m sure most of you know that he will be assuming the duties of Chief Operating Officer on January 1, 2018. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We\u2019re pleased by our third quarter performance, notably reflecting very strong currency and financial result, including growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 11.2%; sequential improvement in our total shipment volume performance supported by both cigarettes and heated tobacco units; higher total international market, excluding China and the U. S., and the continued positive momentum for IQOS in all geographies, particularly Japan and Korea.","However, industry wide dynamics in Saudi Arabia and Russia that we have flagged previously are putting pressure on our results and moderating our growth outlook for the year. In Saudi Arabia, the significant excise tax increase in June, which resulted in the doubling of retail prices, is currently driving higher than anticipated declines in cigarette industry volume, especially in the highly profitable premium segment where Marlboro is the leading brand.","In Russia, cigarette industry volume is also softer than expected, while net pricing in the market remains constrained by the competitive environment. We are therefore revising our 2017 reported continue reported diluted EPS guidance to a range $4.75 to $4.80 at prevailing exchange rates. Our guidance also now includes approximately $0.17 of unfavorable currency compared to $0.14 previously due principally to Egyptian pound. Excluding currency and the favorable $0.04 tax item recorded in the first quarter, our guidance represents a growth rate of approximately 9% to 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","Our full year outlook continues to reflect a total shipment volume decline of around 3% at the low end of the 3% to 4% decline range that we expected earlier this year, as well as currency neutral net revenue growth of over 7%. We do however anticipate a moderate decline in our full year adjusted OCI margin, excluding currency. This primarily reflects the impact of the industry dynamics in Saudi and Russia, coupled with high investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS consistent with our last duration for a smoke free future.","Additionally, for the fourth quarter, we estimate the positive currency variance on our reported diluted EPS at prevailing exchange rate. This is due to favorable comparison related to the Egyptian pound, which has an adverse transactional currency impact on our results in the fourth quarter of 2016 due to its significant devaluation versus the U. S. dollar.","Let me now take you through our third quarter results in greater detail, beginning with our total shipment volume, which declined by 0.5%, 1.3% excluding inventory movements. The sequential improvement in our total volume decline, notably reflected heated tobacco volume growth driven by Japan and Korea, as well as cigarette volume grow in Indonesia and Pakistan coupled with a deceleration in the cigarette volume decline in the Philippines, one of our largest cigarette shipment volume markets.","We expect total volume growth in the fourth quarter driven by heated tobacco units and despite the anticipated cigarette volume drive from Saudi Arabia where industry volume declined by over 30% in the third quarter, and should remain weak into 2018 and other gulf co-operation council markets, which are expected to implement a tax structure similar to that of Saudi Arabia.","We recorded very strong currency neutral financial results in the quarter, building up on our sequential quarterly momentum in the first half of this year. Net revenues increased by 9%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales, notably in Japan as well as favorable pricing of our combustible tobacco portfolio. Adjusted OCI increased by 6.8%, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues, partly offset by the increased investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS, particularly in the new region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 11.2%, supporting year-to-date September growth of 7.1%.","Please note that our third quarter financial results on a reported basis were impacted by the Egyptian pound, which depreciated by approximately 50% versus the U. S. dollar since the third quarter of 2016, based on average quarterly rate and contributed approximately $0.08 of the total $0.12 negative currency impact in our EPS.","Thanks for the exceptional performance of IQOS, our third quarter net revenues for RRPs reached $947 million and accounted for nearly 30% of our total net revenues. Please keep in mind that the portion of this net revenues are from IQOS devices, which yield the negative margin due to introductory discount offered in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching.","While we remain in the early stages of our transformations to a smoke-free future, the size of our RRP net revenues confirms the exciting progress that we are already making on this journey. Our pricing variance of $309 million in the quarter reflects positive contributions from all four regions, and was driven by Asia and Latin America & Canada, in particular. Our September year-to-date pricing variance of $1.1 billion came despite essentially no net pricing in Russia.","Turning to market share. We recorded a second straight quarter of strong sequential growth in our total international share, excluding China and the U.S., driven by both our cigarette and heated tobacco brands. Our international market share was also up slightly versus the third quarter of 2016.","I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Total industry volume in the third quarter declined by 4.5%, in part due to estimated 2016 trade inventory movements related to the Tobacco Products Directive, mainly in Italy, France and the U.K. September year-to-date industry volume declined by 2.7%, consistent with our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%.","Our regional market share, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, was essentially flat in the quarter. Share in Germany and Spain remained under some pressure, largely due to Marlboro\u2019s move above round price points, which I have discussed in prior quarters. However, France and Poland recorded strong market share gains, driven by Marlboro and Chesterfield, respectively. Share in Italy increased slightly, driven by the strong growth of HEETS. We have now grown our share sequentially in Italy for three consecutive quarters.","Regional adjusted OCI in the quarter declined by 7.6%, excluding currency, primarily reflecting higher investments behind the commercialization of IQOS. We expect a return to currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth in the fourth quarter, driven by higher heated tobacco unit volume and a favorable cigarette industry volume comparison.","Moving to Russia. Total industry volume declined by 7.9% in the quarter, due largely to the impact of further excise-tax driven price increases, as well as recent growth in illicit trade. For the full-year, we now anticipate a decline of around 7% compared to a range of 5% to 6% previously, mainly reflecting the growth in illicit trade and lower expected trade inventory movements at year end due to a shift in the planned 2018 excise tax increase from January to July. Our August quarter-to-date cigarette share increased by 40 basis points versus the same period last year. The growth was driven notably by Philip Morris, largely reflecting the successful portfolio consolidation of low-price local brands, as well as adult smoker downtrading in the market.","Our quarter-to-date share also increased sequentially, growing by 10 basis points versus the second quarter. As noted earlier, net price realization in Russia is a challenge this year due to the ongoing competitive environment. In the Philippines, our profit growth continued in the third quarter, driven primarily by higher pricing. Importantly, price increases at the bottom of the market, albeit delayed, have further narrowed the price gaps of lower priced brands to Marlboro and Fortune. Marlboro, in particular, has benefited from the narrowing price gaps, which contributed to a share increase of 3.5 points for the brand in the quarter.","While our total cigarette share declined by 2.4 points, it was up by 1.6 points versus the second quarter, reflecting share gains for both Marlboro and finally Fortune. In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume in the third quarter grew by 6.5%, primarily reflecting a favorable comparison related to inventory movements, mainly associated with the timing of Ramadan. Excluding this movement, industry volume was stable. For the full year, we continue to anticipate a cigarette industry decline of around 3%, due mainly to the soft economic environment and related pressure on consumer spending.","Our cigarette market share declined by 60 basis points in the quarter due primarily to Sampoerna U and Sampoerna A, mainly reflecting the impact of price increases partly offset by the strong performance of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild. Share for Marlboro increased by 20 basis points, driven by the continued growth of our machine-made kretek Marlboro Filter Black offer, up by 1.7 points, following distribution expansion, partly offset by the decline of Marlboro in the whites segment. This was mainly due to its price increase above the round price point of 20,000 Rupiah per pack.","In Japan, the spectacular performance of IQOS continues to drive our results. Our total market share increased by 5.3 points to 33.2% in the third quarter with HeatSticks up by 8.4 points to 11.9%. HeatSticks is currently our largest brand in Japan and the second-largest brand industry-wide. September year-to-date total industry volume decreased by 4.1%, excluding inventory movement, consistent with the secular decline range for cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS.","Our retail off-take shares in Japan further highlight the success of IQOS, irrespective of geography and the presence of competitive smoke-free products. HeatSticks closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 14.6% nationally, up by 1.9 points versus last week of the second quarter, with share gains across all areas.","Importantly, we are beginning to fully supply the Japanese market with HeatSticks and build normal inventory levels commensurate with the growth in demand, a process that we expect to continue in the fourth quarter. As part of this effort, we began the process of shifting our HeatSticks shipments to Japan from air freight to sea freight during the third quarter. However, we effectively remain supply-constrained in the market due to IQOS device capacity. This limitation should gradually ease over the coming months, in part due to the increasing contribution of devices from our second supplier.","We expect to be able to fully supply the market with devices in early 2018 based on our current demand forecast. The current constraint on devices also reflects a growing number of consumers who choose to own multiple devices or who upgrade to the latest device model sooner than we had initially assumed.","Turning to Korea, the exceptional early performance of IQOS continues. National market share for HEETS reached 2.5% in the quarter, despite a relatively limited distribution focusing on Seoul and other major cities. This success has been driven in large part by high IQOS awareness, which exceeded 50% among adult smokers nationally within just four months of launch.","In fact, before IQOS was even launched in Korea, its awareness had reached around 20%. Another measure of the early success of IQOS in Korea is the high level of full and predominant conversion, which reached 83% in September. This is already above the 70% to 80% range generally observed in our more established IQOS launch markets.","Looking now at some of our IQOS launch markets in the EU Region, we're approaching and even exceeding, in the case of Greece, a national market share of 1% with solid growth compared to the third quarter of 2016. As our weighted distribution in this market still only ranges from around 35% to 75%, this clearly implies higher shares within the areas where we are focusing our marketing and distribution efforts. Additionally, in all five markets presented on this slide, we increased our sequential market share compared to the second quarter.","In EU, EEMA and Latin America & Canada Region launch markets, where our focus remains more targeted such as those presented on this slide, we\u2019re also pleased with our overall progress. With the exception of Spain where IQOS was only launched in the fourth quarter of 2016, we grew our focus area offtake share by at least 50 basis points in each market over the past year, and also increased our share sequentially compared to the second quarter. It is important to note that the positive momentum for IQOS outside Asia has been achieved despite the more challenging environment for building IQOS awareness and product comprehension among adult smokers, which is due largely to the stricter limitations on consumer communication. Furthermore, adult smokers outside Asia who purchase IQOS generally have similar high levels of product conversion.","Turning now to shareholders returns. In September, our Board approved an increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4.28 per share. This marked the tenth consecutive year in which PMI has increased its dividend, representing a total increase of 132.6% or a compound annual growth rate of 9.8% since PMI became a public company in 2008.","Before concluding, let me share a few comments on the management changes and new geographic segmentation, announced on September 28, which are intended to drive the Company's transformation towards a smoke-free future while maintaining its financial performance.","These changes should enable faster decision-making and a greater focus on both parts of our business, i. e. combustible and the reduced risk product. Effective January 1, 2018, PMI will operate in six geographic regions, up from the current four, as you can see from the slides presented.","A detailed split of the markets by region is included in the glossary of this presentation. We will begin reporting results based on the new regional structure as of the first quarter of 2018 and plan to provide three years of historical data, reflecting the new structure no later than our first-quarter earnings release in April next year.","To conclude, we recorded very strong currency-neutral financial results in the quarter, supported by a sequential improvement in our total shipment volume performance. The strong momentum for IQOS continues. To-date, we have launched IQOS in key cities in 31 markets and more than 3.7 million adult consumers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS. Our revised 2017 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 9% to 10%, excluding currency and the favorable tax item compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016. This strong full-year outlook reflects currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7%.","Finally, we remain focused on generously rewarding our shareholders with our robust cash flow. For the year, we continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion, and a capital expenditure of $1.6 billion.","Thank you. And I will be happy now to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Spielman from Citigroup.","Adam Spielman","And I have a couple of questions please. First of all, you\u2019ve obviously seen good growth in Japan, but nonetheless slower growth than you saw in Q2. And I\u2019m talking about the market share growing 190 basis quarter-on-quarter on the IMS basis versus 290 last quarter. And I was wondering is that entirely due to the fact that you have supply constraints on the devices. Or is it perhaps because your -- now should not as you grow growing market share is harder, or is it somewhat with the competition. That would be my first question.","Jacek Olczak","The largest weight on the supply of devices compound by fact that we observe more and more consumers, converted consumers who decided to own more than one device. But that obviously creates additional bottlenecks in those devices, which we shipped instead of going to the new consumers in July. I mean, they go to the existing consumers. Obviously, there is some impact of some competitive products. As you know, they are not nationally available. I\u2019m very pleased that even in the places where they are available, I mean IQOS continues grow.","As I said, our total highest weights to the device availability rather than our dynamic in the market, but you\u2019re right to say Adam that the higher you are presumably it\u2019s more difficult to grow. But I still would think we have quite the runway to deliver in Japan.","Adam Spielman","And then turning to Europe. One of the things that strikes me is the big contrasting growth rates between Europe and East Asia. And I was wondering if looking forward, there is anything that you can do to accelerated the growth or whether the strategy is to do what you\u2019re continue to do, which is to grow market share but at a rate, which is much slower than in East Asia?","Jacek Olczak","I mean we wish to grow the market share of IQOS in Europe in the level, which we have in the Japan and Korea, just the operating environment is different. I mean the market in communication and the channels for the communications, which are available to us in Asian market, are not necessarily available are not available in Europe. So we are in discussions also with the regulators and we\u2019re doing our efforts because it is mainly based on the one-to-one marketing in July. And obviously takes time.","So, if I would compare the efforts to which we\u2019re putting in place and the productivity of those efforts in Europe, they\u2019re pretty high. Now, I know that we why are particular into company we\u2019re excited about IQOS but I have with my experiencing in this company reflects the one thing. All European markets, despite the fact that some people may perceive the growth of IQOS to be a lower than I don\u2019t expected in the Asia, are well ahead of any comparable product launch in a combustible category.","So we know that we're pushing the right product in the market that we focus on a right product in a market. And there is no discussions that will continue with that. I think 2018 as you noticed Italy after some period of time is now crossing one share of the market, I think that 2018 in many markets in the Europe will be a turning point. But we just have to continue to stay focused in ways than what we\u2019re seeing is working conversion rates from those who we approach who purchase device on a very high level. So I think it\u2019s just the matter of the effort and the results are going to come, and there will be a tipping point or turning point in this markets where word of mouth would start playing much higher role to the extent as we observe in Japan and Korea.","Adam Spielman","And one final question from me. You said you will build inventory further in Q4. Really the question is when we\u2019re looking at 2018, do you feel you need to build inventory of IQOS any further, or will you be comfortable if it is at the levels you want in East Asia, and in guess in Europe as well?","Jacek Olczak","We have highlighted this 2 billion little bit or more than 2 billion inventory movement essentially Japan, driven in Japan. This number contains as you might have figured it out yourself contain reduction of inventories on combustibles, because the volumes are going down. And bringing the inventories of IQOS to something that you will consider the sustainable level, which the moment where we start the low thinking of device capacity, et cetera, which allow us to continue supply the market without any disturbance.","It is not a typical inventory build-up, which you have ahead of the launch and later on or next period, you take adjustment for -- I do not expect that the pipeline of inventory to Japan to the normal level, which would correspond to our anticipated demand for the product would have to be reversed in 2018. So this is not a classical think, which we had traditional, conventional business that is inventory movement to the positive in a one quarter or one period, we\u2019re resulting in a payback period, negative payback periods in the next period.","I do not expect this to happen with this one. So yes, we highlighting that we shipping the product ahead of IMS or will be market sales, but we need to build this inventories operation, we cannot run to normal operations and they should stay in our base also in a base of our revenue growth for 2018.","Adam Spielman","So you're going to actually be inventory build in '18, I think as we're seeing\u2026","Jacek Olczak","We\u2019re building inventory to the desired durations. And as you know, when your targeting duration is always the question of the forecasted future sales we know where the outlook for the demand is. And therefore, obviously, three months of inventory. For example, three months of inventory today in Japan is a much higher in absolute terms that the tree months of inventories year ago. And that obviously create optically or in fact creates the inventory moment, but essentially I'm just trying to keep the inventory, build the inventory to what we think is the right level.","Taking into considerations that the product is subject to the surges in the demand much higher than any other launch new products in a conventional business, and bearing that in a mean time until we have a full capacity in other locations in Bologna that have to manage the risk of continue each of supplying the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","One or two just start with the combustible business. So arguably the competitive and pricing environment this year has been more challenging in some of your markets, like Russia and Germany. So just wanted to get your color just in terms of what you think is different this year, and how you are thinking about whether you need to really shift your strategy there?","Jacek Olczak","Purely on a pricing front, the biggest surprise to the negative unfortunately came from Russia. Like all the pricing for that launch in a year, net pricing, net manufacturers\u2019 pricing just readily passing the January talks, came as a surprise. And due to the size of the market and our position in that market that clearly put their big pressure on our numbers. And I have to admit at the beginning of the year we knew that the pricing is getting a bit -- not as we already expect, but I admit that at the beginning of the year, we didn\u2019t talk that it's going to last for deadlock.","If you want to see a rainbow, maybe you will have to go for the rain. So I was saying it\u2019s presumably should go well for the 2018 because the prices are moving slowly in Russia, so at least '18 should look much better versus \u201917 as we have now. But Russia was clearly the only market on the pricing, which got reached took us by to the negative place to price. If I look at the German and a few other markets, if you\u2019re referring to some delay in price increases et cetera, Judy, it was always like this. So this is not that I'm happy about it, but it's not something which is surprising. I have seen it -- so it\u2019s a little bit of the normalcy in there.","And then obviously this whole GCC in Saudi Arabia, in particular in the quarter, which is a mix of the prices went up so the industry platform is very heavy, very high target increase. But the market is reacting as is reacting to the 100% price increase. I think and many investors have underestimated or underappreciated the size of the GCC in terms of the volume, but also profitability. Saudi 2016 was a market of, if I remember correctly, around 32 billion units. PMI Philip Morris has about 41% share, Marlboro is half of 28%, actually more than a half of that is Marlboro there.","Margins and this is where that you will see it -- margins in Saudi available of PMI average margins and clearly Marlboro is well above the Marlboro average PMI margins. And the market goes at least at this stage by 30 or more than 30% down that starts putting quite a significant pressure on our financial. I have to say it like this. We have, both at the beginning of the year this guidance of 9% to 12% EPS growth, and I know today that if not Saudi and Russia we would be flying well above 12%, well above 12%. Knowing what has happened to IQOS, which comes very strongly. If I wouldn\u2019t have a Saudi and Russia we would be flying well above 12%.","Judy Hong","So then on IQOS, I mean, it seems like you\u2019ve up the investments in EU pretty significantly year-to-date. I just wanted to get a sense of if IQOS profitability is tracking breakeven as you indicated before. And then as we think about the expansion plans in EU, how should we think about the phasing of some of these markets in terms of going to a fuller distribution and the ramp, and should be expected to see in that market in 2018?","Jacek Olczak","We have said that IQOS will be breakeven in 2017. And actually in the quarter, IQOS already contributed total PMI to the bottom line. So, as we\u2019re actually going to do the better...","Judy Hong","Can you quantify how much?","Jacek Olczak","Judy, maybe one day I will, but I did not today. But we said that we breakeven, we essentially coming to the breakeven in Q2 about and a Q3 confirm that there is a net contributor to the bottom line, which is very handy, if you like, also from a perspective that we have this again Saudi and the Russia, Russia event. So despite the two severe adverse situations, we can still deliver, in my opinion, pretty strong result. There is one component when we talk about the investment in our IQOS.","There was this component of devices. And we have been saying from the very beginning, if devices to some extent being inflating, if you like, our revenues, but we not make margins on the devices quite opposite. Devices alone are a drag on our margins. And if I would do the calculation and excluded devices from take last quarter Q3 results, my margin, my OCI margin would be up somewhere in the range of 80 basis points to 90 basis points.","And what went on a one hand is a positive because if consumers are buying second device, it means that we\u2019re really built better even loyalty of consumers to stay with IQOS, which is very good also versus the potential competitive and result bringing the market. But on the margins, it puts a little bit of pressure. As you know, as of mid of the year or second quarter of this year, we started to leave the prices of device and targeting about $110 worldwide, it will take us a time when the device price will go up in market. So, we\u2019re trying to address. But obviously, devices will not be as accretive to our margin in the bottom line as HeatSticks or combustible products. We also have to be careful when we look at the numbers.","Judy Hong","And then my just last question in Korea. So I know there is post of vote this week on taking the IQOS tax up to 80% or 90% of the combustible. So I\u2019m just curious, as you think about other markets and the discussions you\u2019re having on the tax structure. Is the conversation shifting to there is a relative the risk difference and so there is some level of tax differential that the governments are pursuing? Or do you think that the current tax rate going up to this 80% or 90% eventually is actually little bit more disappointing?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we\u2019re always weighing the opinion that the product whereas the different tax treatment in the combustible classical cigarettes. So, on a one hand yes I mean in Korea tries to move the tax up. I think they are recognizing that the product should have, should enjoy the different taxations than a combustible. So we\u2019ll see where we lag. The decision is not final. But my understanding is that the product will have a real enjoy if you like a lower taxation with combustibles, which taking into consideration, the risk profile et cetera of this product is absolutely understandable from any aspects, public policy smokers, et cetera.","So as you know in some countries, the tax differential is very attractive on RRPs or IQOS versus combustibles. I don\u2019t think in a long, long term that level of a tax differential will be maintained, if stays perfect. But I do think that there will be -- that this product will enjoy a lower taxation within the conventional cigarette. Remember also is the growing understanding of a harm reducing principals, in which the product innovation plays the important role. Even the most recent FDA announcements squarely fit into this direction. And I would assume that the tax policies, as many other regulatory policies, will do differentiate both categories to the benefit of the reduced risk policy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen.","Vivien Azer","So I just wanted to revisit the guidance change please. I very much appreciate your candor around the pricing development in Russia. It seems you\u2019re going in expectations, as well as the big drags in the GCC. But since February, you\u2019ve opted the 9% to 12% guidance. So it seems to me that perhaps there was another lever that you're hopping, like materialize, it\u2019s been offset to justify something the high end. So if you could just comment please on your division to hold behind the guidance up until now, given that some of these negative factors that you called out were known over the course of the year.","Jacek Olczak","Well, if Russia pricing environment would improve faster or earlier, essentially would be squarely in our 9 to 12 or in the -- or then has to go to the 9 to 10. The Russia alone would clearly -- or shorter duration of this price situations in Russia is like, would keep us in the upper end of the guidance. I said before that GCC in Russia is this wouldn\u2019t have happened this year, but would be well above 12%. I don\u2019t want to quantify this one, but I'm not talking 10 or 20 basis points, we will be flying about 12%.","Assuming that IQOS obviously stays as is, which is coming strongly -- is coming very strongly. So as I said, it\u2019s very handy on the one hand that we have this great performance of IQOS, and it is coming at the moment when we have to somehow mitigate financially, if you like, the pressures which will have this year in Russia and Saudi. Saudi will continue at least from the annualization perspective for that next year. We\u2019ll have to see where the markets stabilize. They have some other part of the GCC of the Gulf operation council countries to change excise, the way it\u2019s changing now in October. But Saudi alone is a 65% and profitability is even more. So I think the biggest identified impact and a drag we already have there.","Vivien Azer","And then my next just on pricing more broadly, I fully appreciate the nuance around Russia, given the multi-year half change, which has been quite aggressive. But if I look at your business over the course of '17 with the exception of Latin America, it does look like on the combustibles business, price mix realization has decelerated across the board. And this is the harsh I guess from investors a lot in terms of different sustainability of the pricing model. So given that we\u2019re seeing that decelerating price mix across a number of your geographies, I was just wondering if you can comment on the durability of the pricing model please.","Jacek Olczak","It\u2019s just Russia is I would add to it normally would have, which should have been, if you like, there is a level of pricing in Russia now. Our pricing variance would be squarely in what we\u2019re always saying, 6% and 6.5% actually. So that\u2019s presumably we know that we are now below 6% and still pretty stronger price realization, is just the missing component of Russia. I mean it's all our countries. There are countries, which in effectiveness of a tax structure et cetera pricing is always a bit of a questionable, because it\u2019s a big trade of between volumes and pricing, like Italy and France, for example. But there\u2019s other -- the no known type of a market.","Other than that, yes, I mean there were some delays in pricing in Germany. Frankly speaking, every time when we have over the last few years, has been taking prices in Germany they were always delays. So as I said earlier, it's not that it makes me happy but this is not surprising. I mean Russia I don\u2019t think anybody achieved the success in Russia with what has happened in Russia is positive.","Vivien Azer","And my last question just on IQOS, specifically I'm looking at Germany and the reason I am focused on that market is just pretty much equitable were so good relative to other European market. It looks like perhaps you lost share on IQOS in Germany, if I'm reading the chart right. You had 60 basis points of share in the third quarter. I believe it was 80 basis points in the second?","Jacek Olczak","No, I don\u2019t think we lost the share in any of this place. The only place which we have highlighted, which is going -- which has a growth but this is a very -- comparative other others small growth is Spain. But that\u2019s a different thing. But Germany -- I mean Q3 the numbers were 0.6 for the quarter, 0.4 quarter before. So remember that we do not present really in Germany, we presented in a few cities, so the focus is there. I\u2019ve been recently in Munich and I think the thing start working slowly. Germany is not -- I don\u2019t want to offend anybody, not a fastest market in the world. They produce the fast, but things takes time in Germany. Therefore, I'm very much looking somewhere in euro that I can focus more on markets like Germany and others.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","So if I could go back to just to heated tobacco category in Japan, generally, as you talked a lot of device constraints and some of the limiting impacts that maybe having in the short-term on progression of market share, which regardless is still very good. Could you -- I know this is a difficult topic to elaborate on. But could you give us any observations you have about the interaction between IQOS and competitive products that are launching in the market? I think it's clear that it hasn\u2019t stopped your progression, but I\u2019m sure that consumers want to sample the various products that come out. Are you getting meaningful observations from consumer who are using IQOS and one of the peer products? And then making that decision, potentially using them in a dual manner or switching back to IQOS fully? Just in any context you can share on that?","Jacek Olczak","Well, there\u2019re obviously some interactions from IQOS users with competitive products and vice versa as they cannot especially and they cannot buy IQOS. The feedback we\u2019re receiving is that the taste wise and overall experience and the taste is very important, because people using a product for a satisfaction and satisfaction is stage. IQOS seems to come very strongly. So at this stage, to be very frank with you, I\u2019m not that much worried about the competitive offering here. But obviously, there always will be a trial in new category and why people should believe one product presentations in a category, other products are in the categories, we always will have the trial -- trying the other propositions. But nothing really which would disturb me at this stage. As is innovation, we are working also on further improvements of our products and I guess competitors is exactly focused on the same aspect. So, the game is over. So far we\u2019re winning and I hope we will continue winning.","Matthew Grainger","And just with respect to share repurchase and the dividend increase, you just put into effect. Could you just give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about the potential for repurchases next year? I mean, currency at least on our estimates looks pretty much neutral and my sense is that you\u2019ve always been hoping that it would swing in a more positive direction before you would feel very comfortable pursuing repurchases. But given good earnings momentum and the fact that it doesn\u2019t appear to be a headwind next year, does that make you more optimistic about the prospect of reinstituting a bit of buyback?","Jacek Olczak","I think our focus will continue to be on the dividend, even at the times when our balance sheet was or is under pressure. We\u2019re still under pressure. We still haven\u2019t recovered where we should recover for -- to be in line with our prescribed ratios coming from credit ratings. I don\u2019t think in the near-term we will get back to the buyback unless there is a sudden reverse on the currency. There are currencies we have to come each time positive to us, I would have to be in the times of a better weak dollar that we would recover fully the desired balance sheet trends and start thinking how to deploy the cash to our shareholders in other forms than just dividends. So I think our focus will remain on the dividend and reward shareholders for the dividend, hopefully dividend growth.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. I think that\u2019s pretty clear. Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on some of your thinking on IQOS spending. Has that increased? And specifically, I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s part of the guidance adjustment? Or since you held your revenue guidance for same, is it just your guidance is maybe -- it doesn\u2019t have an upper end, it\u2019s open ended. So, is it just that you\u2019re closer to 7% than you were previously? Or is it that you've kept the revenue guidance, seen the weakness in Russia and Saudi Arabia, but you\u2019ve got an offset somewhere else that\u2019s lower margin. What\u2019s the right way to reconcile all those pieces?","Jacek Olczak","Well, definitely we\u2019ll deliver revenue about 7%, and the upper end of the guidance always is on the revenues alike. It\u2019s always a factor how many devices we\u2019ll be able to ship and how many HeatSticks we\u2019ll be able to ship et cetera. I think we have a good view now on what's going to happen to the volumes and the price in Russia GCC et cetera. So it\u2019s just on this one. Remember I think was a quarter or two quarters ago, I said that we're approaching a time when we have up 7% in revenue and I do hope and actually I think it will become a new norm for PMI.","So as a mix of the volume growth and the pricing growth, I think is a good quality top line growth, which the Company is capable, is able to offer now. And obviously, we\u2019ll be may be much higher that seven in this quarter was -- you could see the quarter revenue growth even if I was to be very aggressive and adjust the entire revenue growth by the growth, by contribution of devices, which as I said earlier answering one of the questions are drag on the margins, at least at this stage.","I still would be well above our past target, if you like the 4% to 6%. The thing we approaching with PMI at the time this type of top line growth should become a -- not necessary on quarters, as you know very well, we never manage the business quarter-to-quarter, we focus in the longer period of time. But I think this is what we can, when we can deliver what we can achieve.","Michael Lavery","And just on IQOS marketing investment spend piece of it. Is that incrementally a higher number or is that -- are your plans there pretty much the same as they were and it\u2019s just the\u2026","Jacek Olczak","Higher than last year, obviously, we're not increasing versus what we've planned for this year. We\u2019re just implementing the plans. There is this variable component, as I mentioned earlier. We've seen that investment, one should also count that the devices if you like or some loss on the devices and that\u2019s a variable component because consumers decides to buy more devices than one per person and obviously, somehow increases the investment. But as I said, we're working for the pricing in our schemes will address it.","But on the other hand, we're essentially -- we have first manifestation of the loyalty of the consumers, because while consumers will buy will purchase more than one device if they are not sure to stay with that product within a category. So I would read it very positively for the future periods. And that\u2019s -- this means that we have a consumer and the consumer is happy with the proposition. As you know, we're rolling out new versions of the devices. I think this will become a norm that every period or so, there will be additional devices.","There was a growing demand for accessories for the personalization, et cetera. I think that Japan obviously will be on the forefront because there is a larger at this stage consumer groups to serve. So there will be other revenue and hopefully also margin from the big opportunities which are ahead of us. So the things which are coming a little bit faster than expected and may put some pressure, again this multiple device ownership this year with the negative margin finally. And we take a bit of a pressure, but I think it's very good for the next period.","Michael Lavery","And just back on -- you've touched on how you have been able to get enough capacity to stop building the inventory in Japan, and save on the air freight. But do you still expect to be capacity constrained through this year? And if so, obviously, then that would mean\u2026","Jacek Olczak","On a fixed states we should now, if you remember, we have targeted year end installed capacity 50 billion, and now with the latest plans and the installations, et cetera, I think we should be above the 60 billion here at the install. So we\u2019re already lifting the numbers. We\u2019ll update in the investors community in February, or what is outlook for the capacity for next year. As we\u2019re still locking in some plans, but that I think, on the HeatStick side, we start getting comfortable. Device I think as of this quarter, as of last or the fourth quarter, we should also be okay.","We activated the second supplier, which offer is as even bigger capacity than the first one. So I think as of beginning of next year, assuming our forecast for demand is what we have decide, I think we should be -- we should have a first year of the start of a normal operations when it comes to the supply side of the equation.","Michael Lavery","Just one on Indonesia, your competitor JP obviously is making up bigger push there with an acquisition. Does that impact any of your thinking on what some of the competitive risks in that market might be?","Jacek Olczak","I kind of think, you mean Philippines, right or JP?","Michael Lavery","Well, Indonesia specifically where big part of distributor and\u2026","Jacek Olczak","Okay. But I don\u2019t think that -- well, I am not saying acquisition. I'm just saying that I don\u2019t think it's going to drastically change the dynamic in Indonesia. Philippines yes, actually so the positive happens to be also JP. So my focus in more on the Philippines than in JP and Indonesia.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","A lot has already been asked and discussed, especially regarding the stepped up spending behind IQOS. But I guess I wanted to go back to something you mentioned in your prepared remarks in terms of the required higher consumer spend to increase awareness. I'm trying to understand why this might be different in some of the markets you\u2019re pushing deeper in versus some of your more established IQOS markets.","Jacek Olczak","Because not in all markets we can say what we know about IQOS and what I think we should say to consumers that they have an access to the full information what this program does versus combustible cigarette. As you know, these regulations -- regulation is always a somehow retroactive, if you think, if you like in a sense that it\u2019s difficult to regulate the things, which are not in the market. They are in the market and then a regulators start thinking what to do.","So we\u2019re not operating in the regimes where it\u2019s clear we recognize that this is a heated versus combustible tobacco product. And therefore we can make X, Y, Z type of claims. So we have to somehow adjust to the local market regulations conditions, et cetera. We know very well that consumers could switch to IQOS, who adopt the IQOS, pretty quickly and they experienced. If they fully switch out of the conventional cigarette, they\u2019ll realize the benefit of switching to the product. I mean the symptoms, which they experience, are very much similar to those who have quit smoking, so they all positive. So this is the word of mouth consumers talked about the things, but this obviously takes a bit more time.","The second thing is that in different markets, you have a different marketing channel still open, being the communication channels where I can advertise when I can talk to consumers, et cetera. Some markets we only -- I give it a example of Germany. In Germany, we can use outdoor but very few things we can say on this outdoors by regulations. So I think there will be some development soon. But for a time being, we are little bit restricted. In Italy, theoretically, we can say more things or practically we can say more things. But I don\u2019t have outdoor or print and we essentially restricted to the communications in the tobacco. The tobacco this is nothing else than the convenience store when the people are coming for 20-30 seconds transaction time. So all of this markets each of them has a different type of challenges and we have to adjust our structures and infrastructure in this market to take the battle. And as I said earlier, essentially with the consumer one-by-one knowing that there is consumer number X, which will be a tipping point and then the whole thing will create a snowball effect, which we have created in Japan or very fast actually in Korea.","Bonnie Herzog","And then just a final couple of quick questions on Japan. I guess first, could you update us on how the new HeatStick variance you introduced into the market outperforming. And do you anticipate more introductions? And then on your combustible business, could you give us an update on the price increase and how you expect that to play out for the remainder of the year in that market? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","The new variant, the menthol with the flavor, I mean it was very well received. As we producing -- we're shipping what we\u2019re selling was we produced. So is also behind. There is obviously some, if you like, internal cannibalizations and now in the presence of more variance consumer are switching from other variants. Variant is responding that face variant is responding through some taste preferences, which were existing or exist in a combustible business. So we will try in some markets to -- there was an important segment in terms of taste segment preferences, we\u2019ll try to cater to this need. But so far is essentially Japan.","And with regards to pricing in Japan, well you know the history, right. We tried we ended up with a Marlboro price increase. And I guess for the New Year time, it\u2019s going to stay unless there are some changes around the taxations in Japan. But I think for the long -- for the first time in a long history PMI in Japan, we\u2019re frankly speaking Japan is missing nothing in terms of generating the growth of OCI in a current situation. Thanks to the fabulous volume performance.","We\u2019re frankly speaking and we have a phenomenal OCI growth in Japan and somehow pricing. If it comes it would be nice cherry on the cake. We obviously know our positions on the pricing in the market. But what was always the bottleneck in Japan that you cannot grow the market without the pricing. We actually found the solution that you can grow the profitability in the market absent the pricing, which normally should have happened but it\u2019s not taking place.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe","So just a quick question for you. As you think about number you gave 60 billion sticks available, HeatSticks available, at the end of the year and that growing through 2018. I just wanted to understand how we should about launches for IQOS in other markets, particularly in Europe where you\u2019ve got a base, if you will, for the product. And I guess related to that, how do we think about platform two and when that made launch or may this go through test market?","Jacek Olczak","Platform probably start in the second -- platform will go to the test market this year, but we still have not announced where we're going to do it. The 60 billion or about 60 billion is a year-end annualized capacity. So with nothing on the capacity for next year, which obviously is not the plan, 60 billion plus we already have in pocket. And obviously we adding the machinery and then activating the other factories in just Italy.","We actually have the first shipment from production and shipment from Romania factory. So, I mean it goes as per planned. So as I said, we\u2019ll update on the capacity in February. So there\u2019s capacity, remember initially we targeted 100 billion year end 2018. And because now we will start the year with a higher capacity is obviously logical that the year-end installed capacity 2018 already will be lifted at least proportional.","Chris Growe","So think about from that standpoint with 15 billion sticks of availability in the fourth quarter. Is that sufficient to start a national launch in another market? Obviously you have Korea building as well here, so it\u2019s larger\u2026","Jacek Olczak","You will have the markets well I mean -- in all of this market, we always balance where is the right moment when we want to go national. And we tried to build a much bigger larger IQOS communities within a territory. And therefore as I said very often this national market share are not really reflecting the pockets in which we focus. And we have places in Italy, in Switzerland, in Germany, where locally if you like markets are 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% depends on the location. But this is how we want to build the whole thing before we start spreading the results is to thinly around -- across the broader geographies.","If you look at the markets also, we started already some developing market, which is also very important in our strategy. I think on the chart we had Colombia, which came to the 1.4% market share in Q3, very strong start. So we will be in a number of geographies, trying to either open the market for the first time is was is starting with a one city, two city capital cities. And in cities where the market where we already presented with some cities to assess where which markets, we think this markets and already for the national expansions, taking into consideration also availability of the marketing channels, et cetera.","So how labor and capital is like intensive, this might be for us to the next year. But I think what we have created through to 2017 is a very nice base of a market to select from for 2018 expansion plans. So I think this was our objective. And some markets may go full speed 2018, some will go 2019. We have now the luxury, if you like, of a choosing how we want to push the pedal there.","Chris Growe","And then just a quick follow up on your total cost in the quarter, constant currency were up pretty strongly by our estimate. Does that -- do you think that they will continue in the fourth quarter? And should that continue into 2018 as you consider more of these launches, and just more investment behind IQOS, in particular?","Jacek Olczak","There is investment behind IQOS remembering the total cost, you also have just the impact of IOQS, right. So on a purely COGS, due to cost on the COGS, due to cost. The cost will be flat, very marginally different, due to COGS. Now, if you take the volume impact, you will have a positive on combustibles because we produce less and you have a negative, if you like, on IQOS because we produce more. And actually that negative on IQOS offsets the positive on a convention.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jon Leinster with Berenberg.","Jon Leinster","Couple of questions, if I might. First of all, just a very specific one. In the Asia region in Q3 on the conventional business scale, PMI cost, to put the price mix in Q3 seems to be decelerated very sharply. So I can understand even with Russia and then so on so forth. But why is the price mix in Asia for the conventional business decelerated through sharpening at the quarter?","Jacek Olczak","It would be driven by Philippines on the volume, Australia on the volume mix, and the rest would be on that positive side. I'm just thinking what drove those CI and where were the variances coming from.","Jon Leinster","Assuming Philippine volume up, Australia volumes down?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, Australia is presumably is also the mix component. Philippines should be on the positive need because Marlboro is nicely growing there, but volumes are lower. And I guess there was in Australia, if I remember, there might be some other smaller markets also there.","Jon Leinster","And if you\u2019re constrained on the device side, does that mean on the HeatSticks side in the third quarter, you could have produced considerably more?","Jacek Olczak","On the HeatSticks side in the third quarter?","Jon Leinster","Well, it\u2019s the same as you\u2019re basically constrained by volumes, and you are saying that the constraint is on the device side. Does that therefore mean that you could have done well above just under 10 billion units?","Jacek Olczak","Not really, because the production is still ramping up. If I would take the year-to-date production versus what we have shipped, or sold if you like, I think the delta is literally couple of billion, I guess. So this is somewhere in the pipeline and the factory warehouse, et cetera. So now we\u2019re shipping to, because now we start having some level of inventories in Japan. Japan is not much restricted on the HeatSticks sales. But obviously, they can supply the market with the HeatSticks, but if you don\u2019t generate the new consumers because you have devices, that is becoming the bottleneck.","So I guess as I said in Q1 I assume when the devices should be in the free supply and HeatSticks will have an inventory and will continue to be in a full supply, we should start seeing a first quarter of operations result in constraint on neither the device nor the HeatStick.","Jon Leinster","And also in discussion with platform two, I mean, the capacity that you\u2019ve talked about the 100 billion or indeed more HeatSticks at the end of this year, $100 billion or more end of next year. Does that presumably a price to platform one or IQOS plus platform two is sort of made in the same way. Is that correct? And is that likely to be actually a meaningful number for platform two in \u201918 or no?","Jacek Olczak","Well, to some extent, yes because there\u2019re two processes in making HeatSticks, one is the tobacco processing that process is shared between platform one and platform two. So capacity can be shared when it comes to making the final product, the stick, the HeatSticks and the platform two will have to have different machinery. So partially, the capacity is within this numbers, partially capacity for the P2E within this number.","But remember, we\u2019ll go to the test market this year. We\u2019ll learn, start to assume that we may need to modify something and then we\u2019ll start thinking whether the right markets when we start launching the P2. So I don\u2019t is that much of a issue for us in 2018 that will obviously have some capacity for 2018 then we\u2019ll have to decide how we want to expand that capacity earmarked only for P2 going into 2019 beyond.","Jon Leinster","Just to be clear, if the capacity -- if P2 on the secondary side, can you see traditional conventional machines to produce the stick on the P2?","Jacek Olczak","No, the machinery line is different. We always were saying the concept of putting few components together and formula route, which is a cigarette or the HeatSticks is the same. Therefore, we\u2019re trying to -- our objective is to do it as much as possible within existing facilities because we can use our people and the scale. And therefore, the learning curve is heavily picking up, but machine wise or CapEx wise, if you like, this will require a separate program, separate investment.","Jon Leinster","So, P2 picks up. We can expect another build out of capacity in different build out capacity?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, but I think we also have learned how to build the capacity on P1. So, once we build the first RRP factories, remember that the quality assurance processes are different than in combustibles, et cetera. So very likely that P2 will be produced somewhere along the P1. So I think there is a lot of part of investments, which were made behind the P1, will serve the P2. But that will require a separate dedicated equipment.","Jon Leinster","And lastly, just in the switch from air freight to sea freight particularly for IQOS. When it comes out factories sold, it goes presumably to PNS or whatever it is. And at that point, who gets the benefit of the lower costs of sea freight versus air freight. Is that margin benefit to you or is that the margin benefit to TNS or is it split somewhat?","Jacek Olczak","This is Philip Morris International Inc who take the full benefit of\u2026","Jon Leinster","At the lower cost. Okay, fine\u2026","Jacek Olczak","It\u2019s us it\u2019s just our cost because we cover the air freight. This doesn\u2019t change anything on the revenue recognition, because always somehow like factories to warehouse, et cetera plus-minus. But this is always at the center of manufacturing. It technically creates, optically creates that higher inventories, which somebody was loading to at the beginning of this call today, because when I have air freight inventories, how long is the plane flight, is a flight from Italy to Japan. You could assume next day you have a cigarette on the other side.","When I put the cigarettes on the boats on the ships and obviously you count the eight weeks or so of either inventory, revenues recognize, but inventories not as accessible to the market for further commercialization because it\u2019s on water. So this is just a technicality of this thing. But as we\u2019re trying to put the HeatSticks to the same model or operations models which we have combustible. There is a significant different in shipments and the sea shipments, air freight\u2026","Jon Leinster","Yes. But who gets the benefit of the shifting in terms of\u2026","Jacek Olczak","Yes, it\u2019s all to us, it\u2019s nothing to whoever distributes or anybody else in a supply chain.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question today will come from the line of Owen Bennett with Jefferies.","Owen Bennett","Hi guys. My questions has been asked.

Please go ahead, Sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 second quarter results. You may access the release on our Web site at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the second quarter 2014, and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise stated.","A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s Webcast slides, which are posted on our Web site. Please note that reduced-risk products, or RRPs, is the term we use for products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As we expected, we achieved strong results in the second quarter, driven by a lower cigarette volume decline of 2.7% and a solid pricing variance of $494 million. As a result, net revenues, excluding currency, increased by 4.5%, and adjusted OCI was up by 9.5% on the same basis.","Both the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions had a very strong quarter, with adjusted OCI growing by 28.8% and 27.1%, respectively, excluding currency. Furthermore, the EU Region achieved a 3.3% increase in adjusted OCI, excluding currency, despite the adverse pricing impact in Italy. The results in the Asia Region, meanwhile, continued to be impacted by challenges in specific markets, although we are making progress in dealing with them.","Our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 20% to $1.56 per share. This was driven by our strong business results and a relatively easy comparison with the same quarter last year.","For the first half of the year, our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 12.4% to $2.91. However, we will face much more challenging comparisons during the second half of the year and in particular during the fourth quarter. In the second half, we will make investments behind the commercialization of reduced-risk products, roll out Marlboro Red 2.0 and incur some underlying costs related to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. Overall, our spending this year is skewed towards the second half. As a result, we\u2019re anticipating a lower EPS growth, excluding currency, for the second half of this year.","As we announced at our Investor Day in June and reaffirmed today, our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at prevailing exchange rates, is in a range of $4.87 to $4.97, versus $5.26 in 2013. Our guidance continues to include approximately $0.61 per share of unfavorable currency, at prevailing exchange rates; an after-tax charge of $0.24 per share recorded as asset impairment and exit costs in the second quarter related to the discontinuation of cigarette production in the Netherlands in 2014; and the $0.01 per share charge recorded in the first quarter relating to the decision to end production in Australia.","Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate, excluding currency and these restructuring charges, of approximately 6% to 8%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013. As stated in June, given the down-trading and heavy price discounting in Australia, in combination with plain packaging, we anticipate that this could result in our currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS being at the lower end of this range.","Let me now provide you with an update on key markets, starting with the challenges we face this year in a number of Asian markets and the progress we\u2019re making in addressing them.","In Japan, cigarette industry volume declined by 14.4% in the quarter as the trade de-stocked following the April 1st tax-driven price increases. Our shipment volume decreased by 16.4%, reflecting the overall market decline and our lower market share. On a June year-to-date basis, industry volume declined by 2.8%.","As expected, our market share in Japan rebounded during the second quarter, reaching 26.4%, following our 25.5% share in the first quarter when the trade built up higher inventory levels of competitive products. Adjusting for trade inventory movements, we estimate our share in the quarter was 25.8%, indicating that the process of stabilizing our market share is under way, and we believe that our share should level out during the second half, a period during which we plan a number of new product launches, including Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth-tasting, regular-to-menthol capsule product.","In Indonesia, we witnessed a rebound in cigarette industry volume, with a second-quarter increase of 4.9%, which brought the first half of the year to a 2% growth rate. We are currently maintaining our forecast for the full-year of market growth of up to 1%.","Our market share increased sequentially from 34.6% in the first quarter to 34.9% in the second quarter, though it was below the last year\u2019s level of 36.1%. While the unfavorable trends in the hand-rolled kretek segment continued to impact our overall share performance, the decline moderated, and we achieved strong share progression in the machine-made kretek segment. This was helped by the April launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue, which reached a quarterly share of 0.6%. We expect this sequential improvement to continue during the second half of this year.","Total estimated tax-paid cigarette industry volume in the Philippines declined by 13.4% during the second quarter, while consumption levels remained resilient, as measured by adult smoking incidence and daily consumption. The drop in tax-paid industry volume reflects the fact that Mighty Corporation\u2019s tax-paid volume was down by around 40%. In contrast, we estimate that its total sales volume, both tax-paid and non-tax-paid, increased by about 20%.","PMI\u2019s share of the tax-paid market increased to 85.9% during the second quarter, representing an increase of 3.4 share points, driven mainly by Marlboro and Fortune. The pressure on Mighty Corporation continues and we hope that the introduction of tax stickers, now expected in August, will reduce its ability to avoid paying excise taxes and VAT.","Let me now move to Australia, where the combination of a certain commoditization of the market, induced by plain packaging, large excise tax increases, and heavy price discounting, particularly at the bottom of the market, has accelerated down-trading to lower price, lower margin brands, or even illicit products. The super-low price segment has grown from 6.3% in 2011 to 28.3% in the first half of this year, when the effective price gap between a premium brand, such as Marlboro, and a super-low price brand, such as Bond Street, widened to about AUD$1 per pack of 25 cigarettes, or about 36%. This compares to a gap of about 26% in 2011.","Our market share averaged 37.7% in the period 2011 through 2013, but came under significant pressure from competitive discounting in the first quarter of 2014, when it dropped to 32.9%. We responded with increased investments in tactical price discounts for choice and Bond Street in order to regain our market position. As a result, in the second quarter, we increased our segment shares in the low and super-low price segments from 31.4% and 11.2% last year to 36.8% and 14.5%, respectively. However, the combination of increased price discounts and volume\/mix deterioration due to the down-trading is impacting our profitability in Australia this year","Let me now turn to the EEMA Region, starting with Russia where our strong and diverse brand portfolio is driving market share gains and enabling us to increase prices. On a May quarter-to-date basis, our market share increased by 0.9 share points to 26.8%, thanks to premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street.","We estimate that cigarette industry volume declined by around 10% during the second quarter. This was driven by price increases averaging some 25% year-on-year, an increase in the prevalence of illicit trade and the weakening economy.","As you know, we announced in May a further price increase of RUB$4 per pack across most of our portfolio. This should impact adult smokers later this month and, along with the implementation of the restrictions on public smoking that were introduced in June this year, is expected to result in a full-year decline of between 9% and 11% in cigarette industry volume.","In Turkey, cigarette industry volume increased by an estimated 2.5% in the second quarter and was slightly up June year-to-date. A stable underlying trend is expected during the second half of the year, despite a mid-year upward adjustment in the specific and minimum excise tax of 5.1%. We increased the prices of our low and super-low price portfolio, Bond Street, Chesterfield, Lark and L&M, by TRY$0.50 per pack.","Our May quarter-to-date market share was marginally lower at 44.6%. However, the premium brands\u2019 share of our portfolio increased, driven by the 1.2 share points gained by Parliament, which reached a record market share of 10.8%.","Let me now turn to the EU Region, where June cigarette industry volume was stronger than expected and included a favorable inventory variance. Cigarette industry volume declined by just 1.2% in the second quarter and by 3.4% in the first half, compared to a 9.3% decrease during the same period last year.","The improvement in cigarette industry volume trends has taken place despite persistently high unemployment levels. We attribute the moderation to a slight decline in illicit trade, a slow-down in the growth of e-vapor products in many markets, relatively less out-switching to fine cut products, and some trade inventory movements.","We should also remember that the comparison with 2013 was easier in the first half of this year and, in addition, we\u2019ve recently implemented or announced price increases in Germany, Portugal and Spain. Consequently, we\u2019re expecting the full-year decline in the EU Region to be approximately 5%, which is a more modest rate of decline than the one forecast in June and a marked improvement on the 7.4% decline that occurred during 2013.","We continue to outperform the industry in the EU Region. Our Regional market share increased by 0.9 share points in the second quarter to 40.4%. We achieved share growth in five of the six largest markets in the Region and expect our positive momentum to continue throughout the year. Absent trade inventory movements, our market share would also have been up in Germany.","Our strong share performance is based on the strength of our key international brands. Marlboro remained resilient with a 19.4% regional share, despite the continued weak macro-economic environment. L&M grew by 0.3 share points to 7.2%, driven by an outstanding performance in Germany and continued share gains in Poland. Chesterfield performed particularly well, gaining 1.4 share points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 5.8%. Its market share has grown very rapidly since we repositioned the brand in Italy and it has also benefited from geographic expansion.","On a June year-to-date basis, our cigarette volume in the EU Region was essentially stable at 91.6 billion units. This was the key driver of the improvement in our adjusted OCI, excluding currency, during the first half of the year. Our pricing variance, on the other hand, was lower than in recent years, mainly driven by Italy, where we remain cautiously optimistic that the government will implement excise tax reform.","In the second quarter, we increased our market share in Italy by the 2 share points to reach 55.3%, as Chesterfield, which was repositioned in February to the super-low price segment, achieved a 10% overall market share, up by 6.5 share points, although with lower unit margins, while Marlboro\u2019s share declined 0.8 share points to 25%.","On a global basis, pricing remained the key driver of our higher adjusted OCI during the second quarter. Our pricing variance reached $494 million in the quarter and $900 million in the first half, broadly in line with our annual historical average of $1.8 billion. Our strong second quarter pricing variance was led by Indonesia and Russia, but was partially offset by an unfavorable pricing variances in Italy and the Philippines.","We achieved a 2.1 point improvement in PMI\u2019s adjusted operating companies income margin, excluding currency, in the second quarter, driven by pricing and helped by the timing of costs. Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the second quarter of 2014 increased by 0.2 points to 37.3%.","Marlboro is one of the key drivers of our favorable market share momentum. During the second quarter, Marlboro progressed to reach an international market share of 9.2%, excluding China. It gained share in three out of our four regions, with a particularly strong performance in the EEMA region. The decline in the Asia region was mainly attributable to Japan.","We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.4%, which puts us at the upper end of the range of our peer groups.","During the second quarter, we spent $1 billion to repurchase 11.6 million shares at an average price of $86.13 and continue to target spending of $4 billion during the full-year of 2014.","In conclusion, the second quarter was financially a strong one, helped by a favorable comparison with last year and hindered by some ongoing challenges in the Asia region. The results in the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions were particularly strong, driven mainly by pricing, while better volume trends in the EU region enabled us to increase regional adjusted OCI, excluding currency.","Our business fundamentals are solid, although the comparisons are expected to be more challenging during the next two quarters. We will make investments behind the commercialization of reduced-risk products, roll out Marlboro Red 2.0, incur some underlying costs related to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint, and, overall, our spending this year is skewed towards the second half. This is already reflected in our EPS guidance and we remain confident in our ability to achieve a growth rate in adjusted diluted EPS of 6% to 8%, excluding currency, for the full-year 2014. Thank you.","I\u2019ll now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, David.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","A couple of things. First of all, I realize you haven\u2019t changed your outlook for the year, but the second quarter come in higher than the internal plan or was this what you more or less had envisioned?","Jacek Olczak","No, this came as per our plan. We knew and we have highlighted at the beginning of the year that we expect particularly strong quarter, partly driven by the comps, as you remember the growth rate in the second quarter of last year was 0.7% on EPS level ex-currency. So it was not really challenging comp which we\u2019re facing, but also we knew that we will expect some continuous step-by-step improvements in the key markets where which we try to address this year. So you had the EU, Japan, Philippines, etcetera. So this all was baked in, so it came as expected.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Secondly, two of your three major international competitors intend to make fairly sizeable investments in the U.S cigarette market to conventional cigarette market, and I\u2019m just curious you obviously exited that market, but did their actions cause you to rethink at all the attraction and\/or the risk of the U.S?","Jacek Olczak","Well, not really. I think we will make it very clear that the reasons are well-known, why we focus on an international market. We\u2019re not looking in a conventional business at the U.S. I think our plans are very clear that, yes we do see U.S on the -- from the perspective of the reduced-risk products, but as the separate part of this strategy. So when it comes to the conventional cigarette, cigarette markets I don\u2019t really see any impact in terms of our thinking of that transaction, which was I believe announced yesterday.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Thank you. Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi. Good morning, Judy.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","So a couple of questions. First, in the EU region, obviously you had called out the pricing variance being negatively impacted by the price reposition in Italy. So just wondering, number one, can you just quantify the Italy impact and whether the underlying -- the other market, the pricing variance has also slowed and then you\u2019ve taken some pricing in some of the European markets, so would you expect pricing variance in the back half or EU to be much stronger?","Jacek Olczak","On Italy I think the Chesterfield repositioning obviously generated some negative pricing variance on the Italian market, but this is largely offset by the volume gains. So I think Italy is more of a question of the VAT absorption which we still have since the end of the last year and this is causing the negative pricing variance. And this is very much linked to the way to discuss or debate in Italy, the tax restructuring. Italy to quantify -- the total pricing variance for Italy would be in a range on the year-to-date basis, you\u2019re talking in the range of about $100 million. But as I said, it\u2019s more the higher component is the VAT absorption, just the repositioning of the Chesterfield, because you pick it up at the revenue level for the volume -- positive volume variance.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Right. Okay. And then, other markets where you\u2019re taking -- have taken more pricing so, broadly speaking if you take total EU in the back half pricing variance would accelerate more meaningfully?","Jacek Olczak","Well, just to conclude in Italy, if you would add to the pricing variance on the EU the negative coming from Italy, the EU would have already a pretty decent pricing variance for the first half of the year, okay, because Italy really depressed the pricing variance for the entire region. And I think overall for the PMI, the pricing variance is about equally spread between half of the years -- of the year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Got it, okay. And then the second question is relating to the situation in Australia and wanted to just get a little bit better understanding of what actions you\u2019ve actually taken already in that market and whether there more actions to come in the back half and just if you\u2019re detecting any sort of competitive responses now that you\u2019ve responded to the competitive behavior in that market.","Jacek Olczak","Well, what we did in Australia is as of the end of the first quarter essentially we will have increased some promotional spending -- price promotional spending behind mainly two brands, Choice and Bond Street, which are the brands, which are competing in a low-price segment. In other parts of the low price segment and they\u2019re being challenged by the discount segment or the lower part of the segment. So that investment there and our actions around this when we try to regain the competitiveness when it comes to the price point versus the key competitive brands. This is a free pricing in Australia, so the situation is pretty dynamic, and you appreciate that I cannot comment on any future price moves, but this is a price discounting situation when the price is being set individually by the key account by trade channel, by territory etcetera. So I mean, that situations may change and may turn -- may change pretty rapidly. So we will have to see. I mean, I think our share reacted as expected. We would have gain the share, especially behind this brands in the second quarter. As you remember, we lost some share significantly, some share in the first quarter. So, so far that part of the strategy works. Now well let\u2019s see how the situation will prevail. I think what is maybe important to say that you\u2019ve some brands already in the market discounted in the low price segment there to the level that they essentially yield about zero margin, okay. So I think once it reach that point, I think a fair question to ask is, isn\u2019t that the moment when the logic should start prevailing while you start to balancing your profit versus volume objective.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Right, okay. Got it. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","I just had two questions for you, if I could. The first would be, if you look at the EU, the first half benefiting from some inventory movements. How much of that reverses in the second half of the year? I guess, with the volumes being much stronger so far, do you have to see -- sort of a major inventory reductions occurring in the second half of the year?","Jacek Olczak","Small component, I think it was mainly in Germany, but you\u2019re not talking about the very important component. So yes, there will be obviously some reversal in Q3. But I don\u2019t think it would change our outlook when it comes for the full-year. Hence as you noticed, we have revised shortly after Investors Day while now having a full June data, we\u2019ve revised our total industry outlook for the year to the 5%. So again, obviously that some inventory movements between the quarters.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And then just another question for you, if I could on Japan, which is that obviously the share of shipments was up in the quarter, but it also was distorted by inventory movements. I\u2019m just curious like what\u2019s -- is there a better metric or better measure for the ongoing share, if you will, in Japan this quarter 26.4%, is that sustainable or \u2026?","Jacek Olczak","The way we\u2019re tracking the performance, we look at retail off take at some key to change there, so -- but the share performance there is somehow reflecting the trend with sequential trends which we see on our adjusted churn. So we start -- we see the stabilization of the share over the last three quarters, maybe 0.1 down sequentially Q2 versus Q1, but it is all pointing to what we expected in the second half of the year, we should essentially have Japan share pressure behind this.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thanks for your time.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you very much.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities","Good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities","My first question is on the Philippines. So despite progress being made with the tax underpayment issue by your main competitor, the market was still down quite a bit in the second quarter. Now how do you see this playing out for the rest of the year and when should we expect the market to stabilize? Then also do you think the tax stamps coming in? I think it sounds like in August now -- will fix or address the bulk of these problems?","Jacek Olczak","The market -- we have to be cautious when we talk about the total market size in Philippines, because we essentially have a better visibility on a tax paid market rather on a total market. Therefore, I think also in our slides we\u2019re using the data on the consumption, the smoking incidence in a daily consumption, which gives a better feel what is happening for the total market covering both tax paid, non-tax paid. I think there was the distortion coming a little bit from what has happened in Q2 last year with the Mighty supplying the market and the Mighty level of supplying the market in the second quarter of this year. Hence you had a 14% decline. When it comes to second question, I think the tax stickers implementation is an important step in the whole portfolio of the steps which we wish the government should have already taken to address that issue. I don\u2019t think tax stamps is the only element which is going to address that issue. I mean, as you know when we\u2019re dealing with an under declaration, I mean you need to obviously demonstrate the same diligence and the vigilance when it comes to all the things that tax stickers etcetera. But we\u2019re very pleased that this is coming to its fruition, to its realization, and I think it\u2019s going to help in overall addressing the situation.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, that's helpful. Then I do have a second question on Russia. Could you give us a little more color on how Marlboro is performing in that country? And then in light of the price increases you took, could you talk about where price gaps are now? And are you seeing any changes in the consumer behaviors given the increases and then possibly from some of the smoking bans?","Jacek Olczak","Well, when it comes to the price gaps because Russia essentially is having price increases, the same absolute amount per pack across the price segment. So, it\u2019s not much change over price gaps -- price gaps in absolute terms, but obviously the price gaps in the relative terms tend to close. When it comes to consumer reaction, the price increase which we announced in May, as I said in my remarks we\u2019ll kick the market around this time early August. So we will have to wait a month or so to have the reading how consumers -- what is the reaction of consumers. I think we shouldn\u2019t our outlook for the market, total market size for this year. I think there is a 9% to 11% range of decline for this year is valid which factored in the impact of the two price increases this year, and also in this forecast it\u2019s factored in the impact from smoking restriction in public places.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thank you, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Bonnie.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Hello, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, good morning.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Good morning. Couple of questions. Firstly, following on in Russia. I was just wondering if you could confirm that you\u2019re still seeing substantial up-trading, as it looks like Bond Street was actually taking a bit more share, say, relative to Parliament. And then related to that, I was wondering two things, if you're -- what you\u2019re estimating is the effect from the greater smoking restrictions or is that going to be relatively modest? And how are you characterizing the risk of a greater tax increase than in the current rolling through your plan, say in next year or in 2016?","Jacek Olczak","Up-trading in Russia, and because you\u2019re talking about the market which has a relatively high -- absolutely in the relative price gaps. So the up-trading is better -- you\u2019ll see up-trading better when it comes to the two segments next to each other. And I think you\u2019ll still see up-trading in the market. So it\u2019s not straight up-trading from the lower price product going to the premium product, but in the segments next to each other I think you\u2019ll see some uptick in the volume. Hence the performance of the Parliament and also performance in the -- of our brands. I mean usually our brands will tend to occupy the upper part of each respective segment. The smoking ban, I would say like there\u2019s -- I mean we have experience in other markets from implementation of a similar regulations, similar restrictions. Yes, you\u2019ll have some impact at the beginning, usually it comes to the moderation later on when consumer adjusts to the new consumption pattern or accommodate the fact there might be places or occasions when they cannot really smoke. As I said this is all factored in our 9% to 11% forecast for the total volume decline. And the key driver behind this 9% to 11% is that, price increases on the back of excise increases which we\u2019re taking this year. So, most of this 9% to 11% is the elasticity driven impact on the total market rather than accounting from a smoking restriction. And the third part of your question, we have now the second year where Russia is dealing or the Russian government is approaching the taxation of the cigarette market through this three year plan. Every year the rates are getting reconfirmed around November I think in their legislative process, I mean do mind the Cabinet. Every year they reconfirm the next two years, and they bring a rate for the third year in that plan is a rolling over plan. So we\u2019ll see how they reconfirm the rate this year. I mean, so far the government was very pragmatic in setting this rate, on one hand balancing -- they desire to increase the tax level, but on the other hand recognizing the unintended consequences namely the illicit trade which they wouldn\u2019t like to have in that market, quite right. So, I mean so far, I don\u2019t see anything which would change my opinion why the Russian Government should not act pragmatically this time. But let\u2019s see, I mean we\u2019ll have to wait until November.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Okay, thank you. And then just a short follow-on on Australia. Where do you see the low and super low price segments stabilizing as a percentage of the market? Are we looking at those continuing to rise over time or do you think that they will kind of reach a natural ceiling and then stabilize?","Jacek Olczak","Well, the prices in Australia overall the cigarette prices in Australia are pretty high. But I haven\u2019t seen that in other markets of the comparable maturity when the lower, super low price segment will take it all. I mean there is always medium segment, there\u2019s always a premium segment. Usually the markets may go into polarization, so it\u2019s more the questions of the medium brand slowly being eroded by the low, super low price segment and the premium somehow holds its position. I mean, obviously in Australia we\u2019ll have to take it for the lances of the plain packaging and some equity presumably erosion of the brands. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a 0-1 game. I don\u2019t think the whole market is going to go through the discount segment.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell with Exane.","James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas","Hi, thanks and good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas","I have, firstly, a question on Europe, please. Firstly, could you give a bit more detail on the price increase in Germany? I think previously you raised prices and then pulled one, so just how much is that and does it differ by brand at all? And also, what do you see as the outlook for pricing in Europe as we go through the rest of the year? Here, you have outlined that Italy is the drag, but what about elsewhere? Would we expect that to improve in H2?","Jacek Olczak","In Germany the price increase was on average \u20ac0.20 per pack. As you remember Germany has various stick counts for per pack sizes, the pack of 19\u2019s and the larger packs, boxes. So per pack, individual SKU the price might be slightly different. But on average its \u20ac0.20 across the portfolio in Marlboro to the low priced -- lower priced L&M and Chesterfield. When it comes to pricing, in Europe again I think we should look a little bit at the pricing in Europe excluding Italy, because Italy is really dragging the price in Europe low. And I said earlier answer I think one of the questions that the pricing impact of Italy is in the range of about -- in the tune to $100 million for the first six months of this year, and that\u2019s significant. You will add it back to the realized pricing and you\u2019ll see that the pricing in Europe is not as being perceived by some that we\u2019re falling a little bit behind. I mean in all other markets the pricing was taking -- a lot of pricing was taking at the beginning of the year usually around the tax rate increases that is especially the case in Central Europe, Poland. I said on the -- during the remarks today we recently took also the pricing in Portugal, in Spain. So, I think the pricing in Europe would have to take a little bit of different view on Italy and the rest, because the rest of Europe in my opinion is not looking as low as one could see.","James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas","Okay, thank you. And just to come back on the Germany price increase. Do I see now that that\u2019s slightly different to your previous increase that was then pulled back in terms of price caps between different size packs or is it the same?","Jacek Olczak","No. I think -- no, I think it\u2019s the same with the same principal. Okay, so sorry I don\u2019t want to say its 100% the same because maybe there was some completely irrelevant fine tuning on one or two SKUs by the same principal, its \u20ac0.20 across the board on average.","James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas","Okay, thank you. And my second question was just on Korea. What from your perspective is the likelihood of a tax raise anytime soon? If it is an 80% rise in average prices which is one of the proposals that we\u2019ve had, do you think that would still be good news after any short-term disruption?","Jacek Olczak","Well taking into considerations that no one almost remembers when Korea had raised the tax last time. I think this would be a good news, but we\u2019ll have to see how it unfolds. I mean, we\u2019ve heard in the past also some rumors or some initiatives even to raise the taxes in Korea and this has not materialized. So, I think myself, I\u2019m more cautious about when Korea will have a tax increase. Well we\u2019ll have to see.","James Bushnell - Exane BNP Paribas","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Hello.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, good morning.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Just a few question\u2019s on Indonesia. I'm curious with the 2% first half category growth what -- and with the easier comparisons in the back half, why you expect the deceleration to -- second half basically flat to give the 1% category growth. Is there some kind of headwind here you expect or consumer pressure or how do you see that unfolding?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean we see so at the beginning of the year, first half of the year some deceleration in the GDP growth. So we\u2019re always looking at the macros in order to feel more comfortable with the total industry outlook. But I agree that 2% year-to-date growth rate for the market versus our forecast of 1%, one could say that there is a potential for an upside. And I would have to confront, there is a potential for an upside. I think I need one more quarter or at least one or two more months to reconfirm that Indonesia is moving to -- the total market is moving to the better growth rate. I mean its good news for us, but I think it was very clear in the remarks that despite the fact that the market is year-to-date 2% we still think for the 1% growth for the full-year.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Then just looking at your market share, you've got the 60 basis point decline in Dji Sam Soe and the 60 basis points share from Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue, so obviously that nets to zero. And you've got the increase over 1 point in U Mild, only slightly offset by Marlboro, but your total share is down over 1 point. So how do we reconcile that as Dji Sam Soe Magnum, the non-Blue down pretty significantly?","Jacek Olczak","No, Dji Sam Soe in the machine made both Dji Sam Soe Magnum and the Magnum Blue in the machine made segment it\u2019s actually growing as expected very nicely. So, increasing our share in this, in the machine made part of the market. Dji Sam Soe in the hand-rolled version, the challenge is, under one hand this consumer is going to the machine made but the prime challenge which the brand faces this year is the price point, well as you see it\u2019s above the round price point while the competitors are approaching, but its still technically slightly below that price point. So I think in Q3 we should see that sort of a headwind for the Dji Sam Soe to being removed. And one more comment if I may, when you look at the Marlboro share in Indonesia, this is all weighted to the total market, right by the white cigarettes market, a non-kretek market and a kretek market are not necessarily highly interlinked markets which in the one cigarette market. So, I mean you\u2019ll have sometimes the fluctuations on a Marlboro share just because the total market growth which happened last quarter came obviously for the kretek as the main driver. So the rate of the kretek market will sometimes give you fluctuations on a Marlboro share.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","That's helpful, thanks. And then on the hand-rolled price points, have you seen a better balance in how the competition looks. I know some of those have crossed the same (indiscernible) mark, but it's a little scattered sort of regionally or by channels and things like that. So, is that looking like that's more consistent now across the competition?","Jacek Olczak","No, this is as we\u2019ve predicted that there will be a -- there\u2019s a time needed when in a pricing [ph] [stats] in the region by region etcetera, these brands or the SKUs will go in across this price point. So some have already reached, crossed, some are still hanging slightly below. I think the Q3, as we predicted initially is about the time when the Dji Sam Soe should have that price point pressure behind the (indiscernible) or in front.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, now that's great. And then just last question on Indonesia, as you\u2019ve mentioned in the release how the optimizing production was -- contributed higher costs, but certainly it seems like if you're optimizing production that would be a better cost profile. So, is it right to assume those are one-time and how significant was that and is that behind you now?","Jacek Olczak","Well Indonesia is optimization or production is essentially to manage the capacity between hand-rolled capacity and the machine made capacity. So, it\u2019s a little bit different that optimizations which we undertook in Australia and in Holland, in Bergen op Zoom. Yes, that\u2019s it. So they\u2019ll have some cost associated with managing the hand-rolled capacity not transforming the hand-rolled to July capacity into machine made capacity.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Well, I guess, I'm just trying to understand what that is. Do you have an ongoing cost, like do you just have idle factories of people making hand-rolled that aren't producing \u2013 I mean, what\u2019s the cost that hit in this quarter, is it a one-time plant closure cost or is it something ongoing?","Jacek Olczak","Well these are the costs associated with the down siding. So they don\u2019t really qualify into reporting adjustments therefore we have not carried out in our reconciliation from a reported to adjusted result, they sit in our underlying numbers. But the cost is essentially about what we need to unfortunately the results were the termination of the employment of hand-rollers and there are smaller and creating a capacity on the machine in the factories which are producing machine made cigarettes.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, now that\u2019s helpful. So even if we keep it in the adjusted number, can you give any sense of what the magnitude is in terms of how to think about the comparison next year?","Jacek Olczak","No, but what we\u2019ve done is, if you remember not in the case of Indonesia but if you remember in Q1 of this year we have said that our cost associated with the closure of the plant in Australia would be $0.03 out of $0.01 was recorded in Q1 which was reporting adjustment and the $0.02 which will pick up later on, but not as reporting adjustment. Now I will have a boss, which also I\u2019m incurring some costs which do not qualify by U.S GAAP rules as the reporting adjustments. I will incur this cost this year in order to complete this project. So, in total if I take all the projects together in my underlying results, you\u2019re talking about the $0.02 to $0.04 which I associated with the cost of a closure or adjusting the -- or factoring the footprint and the capacity optimization.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","Jacek Olczak","(Indiscernible) underlying. This is not part of the reporting adjustment.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Right, Okay. And then just on the Netherlands plant closure, that scales if I believe for September 1st, if that goes as planned some of that benefit would come in fourth quarter of this year, correct?","Jacek Olczak","Very small, I don\u2019t think -- no, this will not be material, because you\u2019ll need to take September 1, with the location of the production. You obviously having rent rates, in the meantime which we already produce etcetera. So this will not materially impact this. (Indiscernible) pick up the full impact of boss of a better (indiscernible) some restructuring next year 2015.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","So it would lag even if the plant is closed for three or four months later this year. There wouldn\u2019t be a savings benefit really in 2014?","Jacek Olczak","No, but I will have as I mentioned before I will have also some cost associated with the closure of that plant which I mean my underlying results, the net of this project you will not see the material impact of that thing. Actually I will be more out weighted on the cost than the benefit which I may pick up for the literally few weeks of this year.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, now that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then, I know Australia has been covered a bit, but just one last question there if we can. Can you just help us understand some of the dynamics? It seemed like even with plain packaging coming in, this didn't -- there wasn\u2019t any real issue over the first kind of 13 months during last year and when it started in December. And now certainly it looks like it's a different picture in 2014. What started all this? I mean what was kind of the trigger that made the issues for you become something you would call out and is it directly related to plain packaging, value brand erosion happening maybe more quickly than people might have thought or can you just explain some of those -- kind of what started all this?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean what started, when I start discounting was much earlier in the market in plain packaging. So, the market always was correct arising by some level of a discounting when people were essentially buying down the price for a consumer at the retail level. What we have observed that towards the end of the last year frankly speaking, there was an increased discounting activity by some of our competitors. So, when we look at our share erosions which I think was pretty visible in the first quarter I mean it was obvious decision that we had to react, stay competitive and not allow the shares to further decline. So yes, there is obviously the element of the plain packing in the whole thing, but I think we couldn\u2019t just attribute the current situation entirely to plain packaging but plain packaging clearly but the fact that somebody took away your trademarks, erodes the equity of my brand. I mean, erodes the equity of my product. So there is an element of the thing, how much you would attribute to this, I mean it\u2019s difficult to say at this stage. You cannot ignore it, but this is not the only element which was, which is happening there. This is all in the context of very significant tax increase which took historically in the last year and also will happen this year in the market, because last year September you had 12.5% extra tax increase \u2013 excise tax increase. We in September of this year we will have another 12.5% additional excise tax increase. I mean that obviously makes the end of year after, so it makes the significant price -- it drives to the significant price increases. And obviously as the market already had the cigarettes at the price of average of about $17 per the pack of 25 of the 25 cigarettes, you\u2019ll have a natural sort of a tendency to go into the down-trading which can be further fueled if you active discounting, because you open the gap. Maybe if you look at the market and you realize that the price gaps are in the range of $6 to $8, I mean that\u2019s the price level per pack in many other markets. And in Australia we have the price gaps of that margin issue, obviously because the underlying prices per pack are already pretty high. But $6 or $8 sort of the erosion in the mix is already pretty significant.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett with Nomura.","Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, good morning.","Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management","And just a quick one, I\u2019m just wondering on the EEMA top-line performance, how much of this was driven by the change in Egypt business structure? How long will this benefit continue before it lapse or was it more a one-off influence in the quarter? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. There was an impact of that in Egypt obviously because of the business structure but there was an underlying growth in Egypt and the entire, very strong quarter for the region very much driven by the price came not only from Russia but came from North Africa, some other markets in Egypt. Egypt played the critical role, but this is in addition of us now reporting Egypt the difference due to the business structure change this year.","Owen Bennett - Nomura Asset Management","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","In terms of the improvement in the EU, I appreciate fully that you are waiting to get the full June results before you have the confidence to raise your guidance for the region. I was curious if you could speak to the sequential trends through the quarter, and if there was any one or two key markets that really kind of drove the improved outlook relative to what you had offered at your Analyst Day?","Jacek Olczak","Just to clarify, we\u2019re not giving guidance at the segment level Vivien, so we\u2019re giving an outlook when it comes to total market, right?","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","Certainly, yes.","Jacek Olczak","But that\u2019s -- no, I mean we\u2019ll look at the June results. I mean the markets which we -- I mean all of the market essentially confirmed what we\u2019ve seen over the last five, six, seven months depending on the market trends. If you look at the total market trend they are three markets which are today somehow lagging behind in terms of declined rate should be better i.e. lower than the entire region. One of this market is, France. So we have to watch it, but I don\u2019t think its going to change dramatically total EU picture. And the two other markets they are relatively smaller market, is Greece and Hungary. So, I have three markets which I wish would follow the trend line of the rest of the region. But even in absence of this I think EU as we announced today in my remarks EU outlook for the full year is close it\u2019s around 5% and its based on the sequential improvements which we saw.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","Excellent. Well, that\u2019s certainly good news. Just a follow-up quickly on Indonesia, I appreciate why you\u2019re holding your guidance I think that makes a lot of sense. I was curious whether embedded in that was an outlook for any change in the fuel subsidy, I know we\u2019re still waiting to see how the presidential election unfolds as they count the ballots, but it does seem like that might be a reality in that market very late into \u201914?","Jacek Olczak","To my recollections, there is not much I haven\u2019t -- I don\u2019t really recall there was discussions about any changes to the fuel subsidies recently until -- unless I\u2019ve missed something, but I don\u2019t think so. On the presidential elections, all fine and we will have to see how does it unfold and how what\u2019s the new direction -- political direction there. Now I was much more -- we\u2019re much more looking into the GDP development, the pricing development etcetera and based on this we\u2019re trying to the best of our knowledge to estimate the market growth. But as I indicated a moment before, I do admit that with a 2% year-to-date our 1% outlook it maybe too cautious. We will have to see. I mean, at this market -- as you know is a market which has a lot of stick sales, the levels of the sales and the consumptions can pretty rapidly change in these places. So we will have to see.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","Yes, that makes sense. And lastly, maybe it is still too early, but I was wondering whether you wanted -- could offer any commentary as you go into your city tests on the iQOS, can you dimensionalize for us how you\u2019re thinking about the pricing of the iQOS system relative to other competitive novel tobacco systems and their respective markets of Japan and Italy?","Jacek Olczak","You know me; I\u2019m a great fan of iQOS. I\u2019m using this product. I wish I could share this with you, but I can\u2019t.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","Fair enough.","Jacek Olczak","One thing when we talk about the iQOS, which is also to explain a little bit our cost variance this year. And I know that I\u2019m bridging from your questions to something else, but its important to remember that the two test markets on iQOS will happen in Q4 this year, okay. And this obviously will also contribute -- one of the contributing element when we will have a less favorable cost towards the end of the year versus the previous period -- previous year.","Vivien Azer - Cowen and Company","That makes perfect sense. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Our next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","Hello. Thank you very much for taking the question.","Jacek Olczak","Hi. Good morning.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","Good morning. It\u2019s a question about Italy and the outlook for changes in the tax situation there. Now, I believe or I\u2019ve seen that there was an announcement, I think in the last day or two, of what I believe is a very small increase in tax, but an increase nonetheless. And I was wondering, first of all, if you could just confirm that I\u2019m right, that it\u2019s pretty marginal. And secondly and perhaps more importantly to comment, if you can, about how you think and when you think there will be a substantial change in the tax situation in Italy? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","You\u2019re absolutely right. There was a very small almost cosmetic sort of a change which resulted in I think a 0.1 -- I know it\u2019s a 0.1 incident increase. The increase, the specific the minimum excise tax on cigarette by a \u20ac1 and the minimum excise tax on the fine cut products by \u20ac3. So this is -- there is some sort of a legacy coming from still last year and just Italy was pretty late in translating this into the tax rate. This has nothing to do with the tax restructuring which in our understanding is that the government is debating as we speak. So we will see how does it unfold. I mean, I think there are number of people who are recognizing that the tax structure which Italy has today is pretty archaic. I mean it doesn\u2019t stand to the market requirements both on the government revenue side -- very much on the government revenue side, but also into overall market. So let\u2019s see.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","When would you expect to have news on a substantial reform?","Jacek Olczak","Well, because it is Italy, the expectations with regards to time you have to be pretty flexible.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","Okay. But this calendar year, I guess?","Jacek Olczak","As I said it\u2019s Italy, so we will have to see.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Adam Spielman - Citigroup","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Thanks for taking that. I was actually -- I had the same question as Adam. So I\u2019m all sorted. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","So I will give the same answer, I guess.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Superb.","Operator","And at this time, we have no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Nick for any additional or closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","Thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us. That concludes our call for today.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations App.","A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced-risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures, and our business transformation metrics are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products. Comparisons are presented on a like-for-like basis reflecting pro forma 2018 results, which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. effective March 22nd, 2019.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer, will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer session. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you, Nick and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our 2019 results continued to reflect strong underlying business performances from both our combustible and smoke-free portfolios.","IQOS is performing strongly across a broad array of geographies and remains firmly on track to meet our 2021 heated tobacco unit shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units.","Meanwhile, our combustible business continues to perform well underpinned by solid pricing. We achieved several important milestones in our transformation to a smoke-free future. This notably included the authorization for a version of our IQOS product from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration through the pre-market tobacco product application pathway and the subsequent commercial launch in Atlanta and Richmond under our licensing agreement with Altria. IQOS is now Commercially available in 52 markets worldwide.","Let me now take you through the main elements of our full year results, starting with volume. Industry total volume for cigarettes and heated tobacco units declined by 2.0%, broadly in line with the historical trend and slightly better than our prior forecast of around 2.5%.","Our shipment volume declined by 1.4%, in line with our previously communicated forecast decline of 1% to 1.5%. The outperformance of the industry was driven by heated tobacco share gains of 0.6 points which helped offset cigarette declines, partly impacted by heated tobacco unit cannibalization.","Focusing on the fourth quarter, I would also like to highlight that while the effect of inventory movements across the year was small, the greater shipment volume decline of 4.4% in Q4 2019 partly reflects unfavorable combustible cigarette inventory movements of 2.3 billion units compared to the prior year quarter, notably due to the European Union region and Japan. We anticipate a partial reversal of this effect in these geographies in the first quarter of 2020.","Fourth quarter in-market sales volumes declined by 3.1%. As previously anticipated in our third quarter remarks, this in-market sales decline primarily reflects the impact of recent pricing in Turkey and the Philippines.","In Turkey, our cigarette volume decline was due mainly to the impact of two price increases during the year, taken in April and August -- totaling five Turkish Lira per pack, or 44% which disproportionately impacted our share given the timing of our pricing vis-\u00e0-vis the competition, in addition to the industry decline. In Q4 2019, our share improved on a sequential basis, but the total market was weak due to a rise in illicit cut tobacco consumption.","In the Philippines, our cigarette volume decline mainly reflected a lower total market in the immediate aftermath of industry price increases. Though from a volume\/mix perspective, this was partly compensated by a strong share performance from Marlboro.","Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 44% to 60 billion units in 2019. This performance including shipments of over 17 billion units in the fourth quarter, reflects broad-based growth across our launch markets with notable contributions from the EU Region, Japan and Russia and keeps us well on track to deliver our 2021 shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units.","This excellent performance means that heated tobacco units, now make up nearly 8% of our total shipment volumes, as compared to almost nothing in 2015. We expect this proportion to grow further, as our positive momentum of reduced risk products continues.","Turning to our 2019, financial results, net revenues increased by 6.4% excluding currency, driven by strong pricing from -- for our combustible product portfolio and growth in heated tobacco units.","RRP net revenues reached $5.6 billion or close to 19% of PMI's total net revenues with IQOS devices, accounting for approximately $0.7 billion or 13% of RRP net revenues.","As highlighted previously, this lower proportion of device revenues primarily reflects favorable geographic mix of heated tobacco unit volume. The longer lifespan of the latest IQOS devices and the impact of device retail price changes in select markets.","We recorded a strong combustible tobacco pricing variance of 6.5% in 2019, better than our initial expectations for the year, helped by a broadly rational excise tax and competitive environment.","There were notable contributions from Germany, Indonesia and Russia, in addition to the aforementioned pricing, in the Philippines and Turkey. This was in line with the average historical variance, since the 2008 spin.","On a currency-neutral basis, adjusted operating income increased by 11.2%, while adjusted operating income margin grew by an excellent 170 basis points. This margin expansion was driven by RRP scale effects and favorable geographic mix for the heated tobacco unit.","Additional drivers include pricing in combustibles and the impact of our cost initiatives, where we're firmly on track to reach over $1 billion of efficiencies by 2021, helping to finance growth investment, behind RRPs.","To this point, we implemented all of our $400 million planned incremental RRP investments in 2019, with the net increase in spend, partially offset by higher efficiencies realized as part of our overall cost program. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased strongly, growing 9.9%, excluding currency and exceeding our prior forecast of around 9.5%.","As explained in the third quarter results, the lower currency-neutral growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share, compared to adjusted operating income, reflects higher non-controlling interest and a higher like-for-like tax rate.","Our strong operating cash flow of $10.1 billion, increased by $0.6 billion, benefiting from a number of working capital initiatives and the timing of certain cash costs related to our Berlin factory optimization. Capital expenditures of $0.9 billion came in slightly below our full year assumption of around $1 billion, benefiting from production efficiencies.","Turning now to market share, our total international share grew by 0.1 point to 28.4%, with lower share for cigarettes, including the impact of cannibalization, more than offset by higher share for heated tobacco units, which reached 2.2%.","The share of our cigarette portfolio declined by 0.5 points, reflecting continued adult smoker out-switching to IQOS, particularly in the European Union Region and Japan, coupled with lower share, notably in Argentina, Indonesia, Korea and Turkey.","Further, despite this out-switching, Marlboro's share of the cigarette category increased by 0.3 points to an all-time high of 10%, driven by Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.","IQOS is now commercially available in 52 markets, representing 44% of the total international market, where our weighted-average geographic coverage within these markets, is approximately 60%.","This follows the addition of 8 new markets in 2019, including Hungary, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and the fourth quarter launch, in Mexico, initially focused in select areas, of Mexico City.","In the latter part of the year, we took another important step in our journey towards smoke-free future, with the launch of IQOS 3 DUO, which is now available in all of our international IQOS markets, supported by our new Simply Amazing brand campaign.","The Simply Amazing campaign focuses on everyday, relatable moments and emotions, by showcasing to adult smokers, who would otherwise continue to smoke the benefits of switching to IQOS.","This latest addition to the IQOS family was designed with enhanced features to help adult smokers switch more seamlessly from cigarettes. IQOS 3 DUO allows two consecutive uses without recharging the holder, while it's charging time is significantly faster compared to IQOS 3 and IQOS 2.4 PLUS.","We have seen positive initial effects on rates of conversion and consumer satisfaction, from the roll-out of DUO, which offers us encouragement on consumers' response to innovation, as we start 2020. We continue to nurture a strong pipeline of future product improvements and innovations for the core IQOS platform.","Turning now to a more detailed discussion of RRP performance. We estimate that there were nearly 14 million total IQOS users as of year-end, representing the addition of four million adult users over the course of the year. Based on our current momentum, we expect this rate of acquisition to significantly increase in 2020.","We further estimate that 71 of the total or close to 10 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS, with the balance in various stages of conversion. This reflects widespread user growth with highlights including a near doubling of users in Italy and Germany, a near trebling in Poland, very strong growth in Ukraine and the addition of 1.7 million users in Russia to reach a total of 2.5 million.","Let me now take you through the performance of IQOS in 2019. The overall share performance for IQOS heated tobacco units continues to see excellent progress. Indeed in international markets where IQOS has been commercialized, IQOS heated tobacco units were the third largest tobacco brand in the fourth quarter with a 5.5% share, increasing from the number four position in the third quarter. This has been achieved despite not having full national distribution in a number of markets as mentioned earlier.","The continued excellent growth of IQOS reflects progress across a broad range of market. Our commercialization approach starts with a focus of the key cities -- on the key cities within a market, building adult smoker awareness, trial and conversion.","On this slide, we see the strong off-take share momentum in a number of key cities. This gives us further encouragement as to the potential future growth at the national level as we see increases in both our geographic reach and rates of consumer awareness and trial.","In the EU region, fourth quarter share for HEETS reached 3.2% of total cigarette and heated tobacco unit industry volume, an increase of 1.5 points but near doubling, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018.","On a sequential basis, share growth accelerated in the quarter increasing by 0.7 points. In-market sales volume also grew 16.1%, compared to the third quarter 2019. This growth reflects continued strength across a broad range of markets as detailed in this slide. It is worth noting that IQOS is only present in geographic areas, representing approximately 57% of industry total volume in the region.","The quality of consumer acquisition is also high with conversion rates and registration rates improving over time. IQOS continued strong performance in Russia in the fourth quarter with HEETS share up by 3.3 points to reach 5%. On a sequential basis versus the third quarter, HEETS share increased by one point, while in-market sales increased by over 20% to reach 2.9 billion units.","HEETS share growth in the quarter was consistent with the pace of adult smoker adoption and our geographic expansion. We are now commercializing IQOS in cities, representing approximately half of the market by total industry volume compared to an estimated 40% at the end of the second quarter.","In Japan, our total reported share for heated tobacco units increased by 2.4 points to reach 17.6% in the fourth quarter, supported by the launch of IQOS 3 DUO and line extensions in a Marlboro HeatSticks and HEETS line-up.","As we have previously mentioned, total industry and share metrics in Japan are currently somewhat distorted by the low price cigarillo category, which grew rapidly over the past two quarters to reach a total tobacco share of 6% in December. These products presently enjoy a significantly preferential tax treatment though the tax council of the ruling party has recently announced the closing of this gap over two steps in October 2020 and October 2021. While the growth of this category is likely to be temporary, we plan to enter with the Philip Morris brand in the current quarter to capture our fair share.","On a total tobacco view including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movement, the share of our heated tobacco unit brands increased by 1.5 points versus the prior year quarter and by 0.6 points sequentially to 16.9%.","2019 in-market sales volumes over heated tobacco unit brands grew 4.2% compared to a total tobacco market including cigarillos, which declined just over 3% after adjusting for the estimated impact of trade inventory movements. This helped drive growth of the overall heated tobacco category to a fourth quarter total tobacco share of almost 24%, including cigarillos and adjusted for trade inventory movements.","In Korea, there remains a lingering impact on the heated tobacco category of the consumer confusion goes by the Korean FDA's 2018 communication on tar. The category also remains highly competitive, particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions that are also present in the cigarette category.","HEETS share in the fourth quarter declined by 2.2 points or by 1.4 points on an adjusted basis. However, on a sequential basis, fourth quarter adjusted share was essentially stable and our segment share continued to grow, supported by IQOS 3 DUO and recent launches that expanded the flavor line-up. While we are encouraged by this trend, we still have a lot of work to do to reinforce the heated tobacco category's benefits and build upon IQOS' leadership position.","A key development in 2019 was the launch of IQOS in the U.S. through our commercial arrangement with Altria. The first IQOS retail stores opened in the initial launch markets of Atlanta and Richmond, marking a historic milestone in providing better alternatives to the 40 million men and women in the United States who continue to smoke. While it remains early days in the lead market commercialization, we're excited about the significant opportunity.","As a reminder IQOS is currently the only heat-not-burn product on the market authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, so the PMTA pathway as appropriate for the protection of public health. We also plan to seek an additional marketing order of the IQOS 3 device in the coming months, which will further support the efforts to convert U.S. adult consumers who would otherwise continue to smoke.","Building on the success of our heated tobacco portfolio, we plan to launch our e-vapor product IQOS MESH 2.0 this year. Following consumer confusion around e-vapor in the later part of 2019, we took the decision to postpone our initial commercial launch. Unfortunately, these misperceptions although moderating, still persists and as such, we now plan to launch in the third quarter of this year when we will also reach the optimal capacity to deploy at scale.","As a result, we plan to -- a faster acceleration of commercial rollout through the second half of 2020. It's worth pausing briefly to consider the dynamics of the international e-vapor market in which IQOS MESH 2.0 will operate. The existing market is concentrated in a small number of geographies with 10 markets making up around 70% of the approximately 25 million international adult users, which despite numbering almost double that of heated tobacco, contribute less than half its retail value. This reflects the heavy existing skew to open tank systems, a low degree of product differentiation and a low rate of full conversion relative to heated tobacco products.","Of these 10 markets, seven also have a meaningful limit on nicotine concentration. The IQOS MESH product has been designed to address this dynamic and will be able to leverage our existing RRP commercial infrastructure and capabilities to drive consumer trial and repurchase. In summary, we're optimistic that IQOS MESH will deliver a superior experience and drive further growth in our business over time.","Lastly, in terms of the commercialization outlook on RRPs, we also recently announced a global collaboration agreement with KT&G for the commercialization of their smoke-free products outside of Korea. The key rationale for this agreement is to accelerate the growth of the smoke-free category, which will require multiple products, providing a wide array of brand, taste, price and technology choices to adult smokers.","The capabilities we have built around RRPs in term of commercial infrastructure and know-how, technology, scientific substantiation and regulatory engagement are best-in-class. These capabilities can be leveraged to broaden our strong portfolio and innovation pipeline to further drive category growth including partnerships with others when it makes strategic and economic sense to do so. KT&G has a range of smoke-free products, which we see as complementary to ours. We have responsibility for all elements of commercialization of product supply under this agreement and we intend to apply a market-by-market approach to deployment.","The agreement will run for an initial period of three years with the intention to expand the market footprint based on commercial success. While we don't disclose the financial terms of such arrangement, this is a royalty based agreement. Products sold under the agreement will be subject to careful assessment to ensure they meet the regulatory requirements in the markets where they are launched as well as PMI's high standards of quality and scientific substantiation of their harm reduction potential. We are now working towards the first launches later this year. There are no current plans to commercialize KT&G products in the United States. With this agreement and our own IQOS MESH launch in 2020, we have an active and exciting year ahead.","Turning to 2020 guidance. We forecast reported diluted earnings per share to be at least $5.50 at prevailing exchange rates compared to reported diluted earnings per share of $4.61 in 2019. On a like-for-like basis and excluding an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.04, at prevailing exchange rates, this forecast represents a projected increase of at least 8% versus pro-forma adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.13 in 2019.","In terms of quarterly phasing, we expect EPS growth, and net revenue growth, to be particularly strong in the first quarter, and notably softer in the second quarter, 2020. The first quarter will benefit from the timing of pricing in the Philippines, and a favorable comparison with first quarter, 2019, which included the absorption of a substantial excise tax increase in Turkey.","Conversely, performance in the second quarter will likely be impacted by, both the comparison to a strong performance in second quarter, 2019, and the most pronounced effect of the tax-driven pricing in Indonesia. It's also worth noting that the higher weighting of growth to markets with significant non-controlling interests seen in the second half of 2019 will continue into the first half of 2020 due to annualization effects.","Let me now explain the dynamics in Indonesia in more detail. As we said in December, the industry faces an atypical year of catch-up on excise tax and pricing. The 2020 excise tax took effect on January 1st, implying a weighted-average excise tax increase of 24% industry-wide, with a 46% increase in the minimum banderole price.","While the potential tax pass-on is relatively steep at 14% of the weighted average price, in the context of a two-year stack, with no excise tax increase in 2019, the average percentage increase is broadly in-line with historical levels. The tax increase and the higher banderole price should also give us the opportunity to address the price gaps which impacted our 2019 share performance. So far, between October and January, we have announced pricing of 8% on a weighted-average basis, or approximately 60% of the pass-on.","To date, some of our competitors are lagging on pricing, and will require a larger catch-up to comply with the new minimum retail price that is effective April 1st. We should also highlight the one-time impact on our pricing variance from the lack of any excise tax increase in 2019.","With minimal pricing taken in the first nine months of last year, we will not benefit this year from the usual annualization effect of increases taken in the prior period. This exceptional dynamic effectively creates a one-off drag on our 2020 pricing variance of over $200 million.","In line with our prior comments, we expect the total industry, measuring 307 billion units in 2019, to decline by around 6% to 7% in 2020, with the highest impact likely in the second quarter, as the new minimum retail selling price takes effect and the new prices work their way through the trade. With the resumption of pricing this year, we expect market dynamics to improve in 2021.","Our 2020 guidance reflects certain key assumptions. The most significant, as we just noted, is the pricing roll-out in Indonesia, which at this stage, we assume to dilute our combustible pricing variance to approximately 5% in 2020. While lower than our 2019 pricing variance, this is still very robust and is supported by a generally rational excise tax environment.","In combination with the projected total market decline of 6% to 7% in Indonesia, at this stage we cautiously assume currency-neutral net revenue growth of around 5%. However, I would reiterate that we remain very confident in our guidance of at least 8% currency-neutral earnings per share growth.","One of the reasons for this confidence is the positive margin outlook; where our efforts to deliver over $1 billion in annualized cost efficiencies by 2021 are bearing fruit, led by important initiatives related to productivity, cost category management, a project-based organization model and other cost efficiencies.","In 2020, we expect cost efficiencies to fully offset expected net incremental RRP investments. With the growing scale and geographic reach of our RRP business, additional investments now primarily reflect variable costs linked to new consumer acquisition and existing user retention, plus new market entries.","Consequently, the cost per user is improving, with an expected decrease of 25% in our acquisition cost per user in 2020. We expect the increasing leverage of our commercial platform to contribute to an increase in currency neutral operating income margin of at least 150 basis points in 2020.","Moving to the industry volume backdrop, our estimated total market decline is around 3.0% to 4.0% for the year. While this is weaker than the historical average of 2.0% to 3.0%, this very much reflects the temporary situation in Indonesia, which represents around 11% of total industry volume. An additional factor comes from the present growth of the cigarillo category in Japan, which is not included in the cigarette total market calculations.","As shown on the chart, we assumed 6% to 7% market decline in Indonesia has an expected effect of around 0.7 points on the global industry, with a further 0.3 points from the growth of cigarillos in Japan.","While there are the usual puts and takes elsewhere, together these two temporary impacts fully explain the deviation from the historical average with underlying fundamentals remaining unchanged.","An additional upcoming development included in our industry forecast is the Tobacco Products Directive ban on menthol cigarettes in the European Union, effective May 2020.","Menthol and menthol capsule variants make up for around 10% of consumption in the region. And while we do not expect a significant impact on the overall industry volume decline of 1% to 2%, there is a further opportunity for IQOS given that menthol HEETS variants are not covered by the ban.","We expect PMI shipment volumes in 2020 to again outperform the industry trend, and anticipate a total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume decline of approximately 2.5% to 3.5%. We expect our shipment volume trends to be slightly better in the second half compared to the first half due to the dynamics already mentioned in Indonesia and Turkey.","While we're not providing a specific 2020 target for heated tobacco unit shipment, we expect continued broad-based growth and remain well on track to meet our shipment volume target of 90 billion to 100 billion units by 2021.","We anticipate a full year effective tax rate of approximately 23%, consistent with last year, and a relatively stable net interest expense compared to 2019. We're targeting 2020 operating cash flow of approximately $10.5 billion, subject to year-end working capital requirements and currency movements.","This includes the expected one-time adverse impact of new excise payment rules in Australia, and the timing of certain cash costs related to the Berlin factory restructuring.","Together, these two factors account for an expected unfavorable cash impact of approximately $350 million. We project total capital expenditures this year to be approximately $1 billion.","Summing up a strong year, we made very significant progress in our transformation to a smoke-free future in both our organization and our 2019 business results. Just over four years since the first full-scale IQOS commercial launch in Japan in September 2015, we already have $5.6 billion in RRP net revenues, making up almost one fifth of our business.","Importantly, RRP revenues are increasingly accretive to our profits, as evidenced by the strong margin growth seen in 2019, and expected in 2020. IQOS continues to perform strongly, with 35% growth of HTU in-market sales volumes from an increasing number of markets where close to 10 million adult smokers have already stopped smoking and switched to IQOS.","We project the number of new users over the course of 2020 to be significantly higher than 2019 and at a cost per user that is lower, as the large RRP infrastructure investments of the past several years are mostly completed.","We are also very focused on maintaining the leadership of our combustible tobacco portfolio, which is delivering robust performance and pricing power. Despite the temporary headwinds in Indonesia, we are confident in our 2020 guidance and remain well on track to deliver our 2019 to 2021 compound annual ex-currency growth targets of at least 5% net revenue growth and at least 8% adjusted earnings per share growth.","Finally, we are confident in our strategy for a smoke-free future and are convinced that our current and future RRP portfolio continues to provide us with the single largest opportunity to accelerate our business growth and generously reward our shareholders over time.","Thank you. Martin and I are now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer session of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Michael Lavery from Piper Sandler.","Michael Lavery","Thank you. Good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Michael.","Martin King","Good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Good morning.","Michael Lavery","Can you touch on IQOS, and some of what's going on in really sort of two different ends of the adoption curve? I guess, on the one hand you see a market like Hungary, for example, that has four share points plus in just a year out of nowhere. But then you're also talking about the lower costs of acquisition per user that you've mentioned in the past comes from scale and growing word of mouth. I guess I'd love to just understand both dynamics a little bit more. One is, how are you driving some of the rapid adoption in select markets. And then second, what are some of the key drivers of your efficiencies as they get a little bit more mature.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yes. Well, I guess, as a learning organization, every time we launch in a new market, we apply what we learned from the previous one. So the time where we start growing faster is shorter and shorter. And I think we showed a chart like this recently and will explain that in CAGNY next week. So it's a learning organization. The deployment of more digital skills that makes that every new market, we open starts growing faster than the previous one, and that's fact of organization knowledge.","Now as we have also the infrastructure in place, clearly, the cost per user will decrease and does decrease this year in 2020, we have to invest a little bit more money in retention. I would say, although the cost of retention will also go down as we have more people. But clearly, you know, and the cost of acquisition is higher, so it makes sense. Now that we have enough people in our CRM base to invest a bit more there, because losing a consumer that we have acquired is much bigger loss than not acquiring someone by definition. Okay. And also because now we have the digital infrastructure, we can start enlarging beyond over time the offering beyond accessories and just special editions and normal products to more things that can help us build a different type of business over time as we have data on consumers and so on.","So I'm optimistic that, although we will continue investing Michael, incrementally in the RRP, so we grow the number of users. This cost per user is going to go further and further down and obviously you know, we retain more consumers, so that's all on the positive side and that's how I see it define. Was that clear?","Michael Lavery","No. That's very helpful. Thank you. One just quick follow-up related to that. When you look at the evolution of IQOS usage of consumers, you've shown the charts that it's pretty consistently show around 70% of users who fully convert. But obviously, you're also adding new users constantly as well who have obviously just gotten started. What amount of time does it typically take for somebody to transition and maybe related to saying it kind of a different way, for users that began using the product, say, a year or two ago, is the amount that's fully converted more like 75%, 80% or 85%, or how should we think about that dynamic?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, for the new users clearly, on average, we say two weeks to a month depending on the individual, sometimes people take much more time to fully switch. Okay. They start using the products immediately obviously, because they bought it. Now, regarding retention over time, it's fairly stable, I would say, and I think with the new programs, we have in our CRM, will increase this retention. Now it depends also on the market as you know.","In markets, where we have a lot of competitive activity, we get some dilution of consumption, because people buy other devices typically vastly cheaper from competition and they try a few products, but if I compare markets where the competition is not yet successful, I think we have very good retention, and I think we can further enhance this retention as we now deploy a much better CRM program during the year. So I'm really happy with what we have and we can improve from here.","Michael Lavery","That's great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Rampton with UBS.","Robert Rampton","Hello. Three questions for me. The first would be in \u2013 outside Korea and Japan, are there any markets where IQOS volumes have declined sequentially and then on the flip side, are there any markets where sequential growth has accelerated?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. I mean, except for Korea, I would say, we have growth in every market. Okay. Korea is a particular phenomenon because there is a confusion of consumers around the heat-not-burn category that is not dissimilar to what happened in many markets on the e-vapor category and that happened at the beginning of last year in June, when the Korean FDA, although they found a very significant reduction in the toxicants of heated tobacco product compared to cigarettes, very similar to what we have communicated, they kind of confused consumers by saying yes, but the tar of this product is very similar to cigarettes, although, we're comparing apples with oranges, because there is two different paths. The one is water and glycerin, and the other is but chemical.","So this has stalled the category, and I think will take a bit of time to restart the process. I think sooner, or later there is realization by the authorities in Korea that that's not the right thing to do with consumers and the alignment we have now much more with KT&G, after the agreement, I think they will help grow the category, but except for Korea, I don't see any other place where we have an issue.","Robert Rampton","Great. And then just in terms of the margin expansion. So, if we think about, how much of your 2020 expectation is driven by say cost saves, pricing and IQOS, is it fair to think that the impact of IQOS is offset by cost savings and the incremental increases pricing or how should we think about that?","Martin King","Yeah, the margin expansion is driven by a number of factors. First of all, it's partly mix in that we're growing very rapidly now in the EU, which has very good margins on IQOS via tobacco units. The second piece is, as you point out, our cost saving initiatives have stepped up significantly.","At this point, the investments that we're making behind RRP are now fully offset by these cost savings initiatives and that's where you get the big benefit for margin expansion and the cost saving breaks down into a couple of buckets. In the operations area, we have various productivity, especially, as we get better and better at producing the consumables for heated tobacco units with scale, better uptime on the equipment for waste.","We're improving the footprint across the whole manufacturing area. You saw the factory optimizations we've done in the last year, which begin to pay off in 2020 and beyond and we also have initiatives across all of our spending categories to find ways to become more efficient intelligently and rotate money out of less efficient areas and be able to put it into reduced risk products.","So that whole effort started to pay off for the last year, you saw our margin expansion last year was very strong at 1.7 percentage point increase and then this year we're committing to at least 1.5 percentage increase, and this is something that we will continue to focus on in the out years going forward as well.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah. Regarding pricing, I would say, as I explained, we foresee pricing to be a bit below this year than 2019, but is essentially due to Indonesia, okay. Because if we took 2019 we had annualization of pricing from 2018 in Indonesia, which at this stage we assume is not going to happen.","Obviously, one, there was no real pricing in 2019. So you have no annualization in 2020 and we have to be a bit cautious about pricing and how it rolls out in Indonesia, there is a pretty steep increase. But we assume that this situation will resolve during 2020. So in 2021 we have annualization of pricing in Indonesia and come back to normal, okay.","Robert Rampton","Excellent. Apologies. Just one follow-up, in terms of IQOS operating margins, can you give us some color on how it compares to cigarettes in say Italy at one end and Russia at the other?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, IQOS margins are higher than cigarettes. Okay. So that's basically clear and a lot of the margin improvement is coming, as Martin explained from IQOS essentially.","Robert Rampton","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer from Cowen.","Vivien Azer","Thank you. Good morning.","Martin King","Hey, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","So you guys sound very constructive on the momentum on IQOS that is clear. I was hoping that you could comment on your key competitor's commentary this morning for the RRP category in Japan. Specifically, they may be have a different view than you specifically saying that they're looking for more moderate growth to capture 25% of industry volumes as competition intensifies, can you comment on that.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I think it's very difficult to comment at this stage what is going to be the precise growth of the category. Maybe I see it higher than them, but we see both growth and that's the important part. And I think we are well positioned with all the initiatives we have to capture the largest part of the growth.","So we'll see as the year unfolds where exactly we end, but the key thing is that we remain focused. IQOS still has a lion's part of the segment share and the momentum is positive and accelerating. We're increasing segment share and overall market share. So that's the key thing to retail.","Vivien Azer","Perfect. That's helpful. Just a follow-up on in Japan. Can you offer any color on what your HTU mix is between HEETS and Marlboro at the end of 2019?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I don't have the exact numbers in my head, but I would say the cannibalization is stable. We had a little bit of down-trading, I would say, after the price increase because Marlboro increased prices more than HEETS, but now it's back to stable and both are growing, but Marlboro is growing, again.","Martin King","I think, Vivien, we haven't given the exact split.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah.","Martin King","But I think it's safe to say that Marlboro's share, Marlboro HeatSticks share ended up being more than we had originally expected. We thought that HEETS would a bigger component by now and Marlboro HeatSticks has held up better than we expected given the pricing.","On the other hand, HEETS did its job of expanding their category and making the offering available to a broader array of consumers that were more price sensitive. So we're satisfied with this performance and overall it did its job. However, more heated tobacco users opted to stay with the Marlboro HeatSticks than we originally planned, which is positive of course for our margins and for the profitability.","Vivien Azer","Sure, absolutely. Now, that's a great outcome. Last one from me. Andr\u00e9, I appreciated your commentary on some of the e-vapor concerns that are spreading seemingly to the EU. That's certainly consistent with what we heard from one of your competitors yesterday. Are there any principal markets that we should be watching out for, in particular where consumer concern or confusion around e-vapor risk is taking hold most dramatically?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, I think the maximum was after the unfortunate cases in the U.S. with the lung disease and deaths that was spun by some people in the wrong way. As you know, I think this is getting better, but we are not there out yet, because there are still people that spread confusion despite all the efforts.","Myself and others are making to explain that this has nothing to do with the e-vapor category and more with misuse with cannabis, oils and so on. My \u2013 our perspective on this was in any case our plan on e-vapor was to build the capacity and go into the bulk of the market, that is the European Union towards the year end, okay, because then we have capacity at scale.","We had planned a couple of markets earlier on a try basis. I think it's better not to put oil in the fire, especially, since we will put the e-vapor under the IQOS brand. So to minimize confusion, I prefer that we let a little bit time fly. We build capacity and it doesn't move in reality our plan for the European Union, which was towards the end of this year. So that's my perspective.","And I think that it's about time, there are more voices here to stop misleading people and I was reading the recent Q&A by the World Health Organization and it's not my commentary, but it is so much of misleading and I would say malicious statements in there that some of the top advocates in public health came out and said, this is unacceptable. So they modified their version, but they still misleading.","So I think short-term that may appear not a good thing, but long term, the more people say insane things, the more credibility they lose and the more the alternatives will become more credible because they lose their credibility. And I think we are in this phase now who are frankly speaking, you see more and more of this nonsensical thing and more and more voices saying let's stop these, have I reset now of the situation and stopped talking seriously because these alternatives are better for people would otherwise smoke. But as far as the commercial part is concerned, that's it -- that's why, it's what I said and I explained just now. Hope I'm clear.","Vivien Azer","Very clear. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Adam Spielman from Citi.","Adam Spielman","Hello, thank you very much for taking the question. As Vivien was asking about Japan, can I just ask one quick question there before turning to IQOS. And the question on Japan, is whether in your pricing variance, you're baking in any assumption for the around the tax rise that we're obviously going to get in October this year, so that's the first question.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, any, pricing is all in the guidance, obviously Adam. So we're always hope there is an opportunity in Japan, when there is a tax increase to get pricing, we'll make some assumptions, we'll see how much they materialize or not.","Adam Spielman","Perfect, that's very, very clear. So the real question, the core question is obviously around IQOS and so one \u2013 and so thinking about the European to begin with, the European Union to begin with, in Q3, you had 0.1% quarter-on-quarter market share growth and then you've had a much high, really, really strong growth in Q4.","And I was just wondering how you should think, how we should think about EU market share progressing going forwards, whether there is any sort of seasonality in that and how you think we should sort of smooth out those two things, slightly disappointing in my view in Q3 and then a really strong performance just in Q4?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. In broad strokes, okay, there is as on seasonality in summer pretty obviously that's favoring cigarettes hence a little bit less market share on the heated tobacco unit. The second thing, although IQOS was very marginally affected by the whole situation of e-vapor in the U.S., it was just the moment in the quarter, we had a bit of a slowdown in September I would say but we recovered as of October\/November and I think we're entering 2020 with a pretty good momentum.","Number of users is increasing. As I explained, I think the menthol is an opportunity for us towards second half of the year. So I'm very optimistic about the momentum and outcomes in the European Union.","Adam Spielman","And so just to summarize, I think you're saying, you expect to get more new users in the EU in 2020 than you did in 2019, partly because of a medical issue, but also the CRM that just the whole momentum is so good?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah, that's what I'm saying.","Martin King","Hey Adam, I'm Martin. On the IQOS heated tobacco unit share in the EU there is seasonality there. If you look at for instance in 2018, you see the same basic dynamic, where the increase from Q2 to Q3 is relatively small with a bigger increase from Q3 to Q4 and then again in 2019 you see the same dynamic.","In addition, this year we had even more pronounced effect that Andr\u00e9 mentioned with the other news flow, but this is -- this is back to the seasonality piece. Cigarettes in EU are going to be higher because it's warm weather, people go outside and they can use it more and then lower in the winter months, whereas IQOS you could use much more easily frequently without any worry as far as what the weather outside is, so you don't see the volume changes quarter-to-quarter as much as you do on cigarettes. So it's really the cigarette seasonality that's driving these share numbers to be impacted.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Overall, I would say, Adam, we see a significant increase in the number of users overall across the market. Okay. And I think it's also due to the fact that we're getting scale, getting momentum. We see more word of mouth happening in the markets and the tools we use now are more scalable. So I hope we will see this accelerate.","Adam Spielman","And then quickly, so turning to Russia, which obviously is a very large market and you're gaining share very fast. Roughly speaking, well in Q3 last year you had roughly 1% market share, you've now got 5%, so in five quarters you've gained four percentage points of market share. I guess the question is, do you think that rate of growth can continue or would you expect it to slow slightly?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, first of all we need to compare comparable things. Okay. We are still growing in cities where we started before. There is some obviously some expansion in there that helps and we still have scope for expansion. Now it's pretty clear in my mind that at a certain stage, we would need probably a second price point in the portfolio in Russia because in certain cities, we will be getting the essence of the premium and somehow, a large part of the more I would say wealthy part of the mid-price segment. I don't know that we will need this in 2020, but we have to plan at least for 2021. Okay. And that's how I see it. So we don't see a slowdown, but we need to prepare for reaching the limits in terms of affordability over time in the big cities. Now in the cities we just started clearly, we have more runway in front of us.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman from Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","Hi, good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Pamela.","Martin King","Hello, good morning.","Pamela Kaufman","So over the last several years, you've quantified a level of incremental IQOS investment in each year. How much incremental investment do you anticipate in 2020 relative to 2019?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, in my view is going to be a bit less than 2019 and it's all variable. At the end of the day, it all depends on the number of new consumers you acquire. So I would say we would be between 300 and 350 depending on the number of new users and that we have because there are certain cost that are purely variable. But as Martin clearly said, all this is offset on a comparable basis by all the savings we have in -- from a cost saving initiatives. So that helps clearly the margin expansion plus the geographic mix of IQOS that is helpful.","Pamela Kaufman","Thanks. That's helpful. And I wanted to better understand your decision to partner with KT&G and how you see their products competing with IQOS and given that this partnership expands your portfolio to e-vapor and hybrid products, do you also see a need to fill the gap in modern oral?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah, I think at the end of the day I said many times, I don't think we will do all the new products on our own or invent everything and we're very open to partnership and this is a very simple principle is what can we add to the partnership. I think we have technology, we have IP that complements, we have the scientific assessment capabilities and obviously the route to market. And in my view KT&G has an interesting product like the hybrid product, which by the way is a peripheral heated tobacco product that vaporizes at the same time.","When we think there is potential in certain markets and certain consumer segments, their heated tobacco product has -- is the second more performing heated tobacco product and it's also heating from the inside and I think with the know-how we have if necessary, we can improve this product. And I think we decide market-by-market, what are the right price points for this product, so that they are complementary to our IQOS strategy. And as we discussed in Japan, for Japan, there may be some cannibalization, but from Japan, for example, we did two price points with our own products. We didn't see much cannibalization. We're still much more incrementality. So that's how I see it.","For the e-vapor product, we have not major plans at this stage, but a much more interested in their hybrid and the heated tobacco with the team that has potential in these markets and that's how I see it.","We also have more alignment I would say overall, in Korea, that's important for the Korean market. And we also have access from a technology point of view to a country like Korea that is one of the centres for electronics. So I think it's a win-win for both companies. It's a license agreement, the financial works for both of us. So I look forward to working with them and expanding in the right markets offering consumers much more wide range of products.","Pamela Kaufman","Thank you. And can you give an update on the impact on new user adoption in Japan from your device price reductions and other initiatives to accelerate IQOS growth in this market over the last year? Are you seeing increasing heated tobacco adoption and trial among the harder to convert later adopters?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Certainly, we see some. I think the IQOS DUO would help, because consecutive use for some people is important. We addressed this problem with the multi, but now we address it also with the main product and we see better adoption.","The pricing is also in general to avoid all these promotions and promotional money, we think that's the right price of the product and we always prepare the portfolio for the next generation that will always come at a premium. So we always reduce the previous version price in view of the forthcoming new version. And as I explained, many times, we have a strategy of having a major innovation every two, three years and significant upgrades every year in the portfolio and that's why we're doing in Japan.","So say that there is enormous reduction -- reaction just because we reduced the device prices, it helps, but there is a whole mix that works. We see actually more reaction in Russia where disposable income is really an issue. By having still the 2.4 Plus on the market and IQOS 3, where still a lot of consumers buy the 2.4, because the more price sensitive market.","I think the answer is not only pricing, is much more resolving constantly the consumer pain points that are a barrier to entry in the category and that's why we're working on the current version and the forthcoming one. So that's a little bit the philosophy we apply.","Pamela Kaufman","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi, I just had a question for you and a bit of a follow-on from earlier question. As you said, your cost per user and acquiring users in IQOS is going down, and I guess I'm interested in that scale effect you have in RRPs. You, obviously, had to spend more money this year but I think at the same time, I'm just trying to understand how you can leverage that infrastructure you have as you think about the launch of Platform 2 or MESH. Is the lot of the same or are a lot of the same resources being used for that? Are those -- I assume they are figured as part of the $300 million to $350 million you cited for this year as you think about the launch cost of those new products.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, obviously, these new products, if you go through our infrastructure, which means our own retail, third-party retail where this kind of franchises. Our own digital platforms now that are put in place, our coaches, obviously you can use the infrastructure you have in a much more efficient way.","So I would say that, still the vast majority of the investment during the year is still on IQOS heat-not-burn and we assume even when we are allowed a bit more massively IQOS before it's going to be on a per user basis much cheaper compounded by the fact that we don't have to explain the category to people. We just need to explain to people what the difference is and what the benefits of MESH are compared to existing e-vapor product. So there is no category explanation effort behind. So it will be much cheaper in my view or less expensive than the heat-not-burn product.","Chris Growe","Okay. Yeah, thank you for that. And then one of the follow-up question. And this gets to a question, a bit of a question earlier in your response. But you have seen this -- a number of markets in the EU, where IQOS market share has really accelerated and we talked in the -- couple of -- few years ago about in Japan when you got over that 2% to 2.5% threshold, you start -- started to see market share really accelerate. Are we at that point in the EU? Do we see that in the fourth quarter? Because some of those market share increases are quite notable. Are we at that stage is my question and are you seeing that in more markets, or do you hope to see that more markets in 2020?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, we hope we'll see in more and more markets in 2020. As I said we expect the number of users to grow, which means compared to -- we had 4 million users, we expect a much higher number than that. So I call this acceleration on a same market basis, okay.","Look it's the beginning of the year, we feel good about the fourth quarter. We have good momentum going into 2020. We'll keep you up to date on how we progress and that comes at a much lower cost. So I think we're building it pretty nicely.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Operator","We have time for one final question and that is from Gaurav Jain from Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Hello, good morning. My question is on the Canadian subsidiary, so can you tell us where we are with the RBH creditor protection negotiations, which are happening?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, they are progressing, but I cannot give you more details. Okay. Still, there is a stay of all litigation and there are discussions to resolve the issue. Once we have something concrete, I can give you more details, but things are progressing.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. A follow-up, on the IQOS MESH launch, so would you consider applying for a PMTA, considering Altria changed some of the language around their Juul agreement, if Juul is not allowed in the market for a year and other things?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I think we have a lot of plans for before. So, one day, we will probably apply for PMTA in the U.S., but we still have to finalize a few studies on P4, for we have the same type of file as we head for IQOS, but that's important also for many other countries. And in due time, we will discuss if and when we want to enter the U.S. market. The FDA is going to be very busy in the U.S. over the next you know few months on, on all the PMTAs. I don't think that's the appropriate moment to do anything.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. And if I can ask one last question, can you comment on the sell-in versus sell-through trends for IQOS, both in the last quarter and for the full 2019?","Martin King","I'm sorry, the in-market sales versus the shipments or in your words, sell-in versus sell-out, we are approximately equal. If anything actually, the IMS was a little bit more than the shipments. So, there was no inventory change on the year.","Gaurav Jain","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah, it's in line with I said from beginning of the year.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Thanks a lot.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay.","Martin King","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes the Q&A session of today's call. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah. I would like to thank you all for joining. First of all, I would say, we had a pretty good 2019. We're entering 2020 in a very good shape. We outlined the one unusual thing that is Indonesia. We think we'd see how this unfolds. We prefer to be cautious about this at the beginning of the year. And just something that is in the air just now, I mean this whole, this issue around the coronavirus. We have no problem today.","But clearly, if that continues, there may be some impact on travel and the duty-free and in terms of supply chain; I think we're in pretty good shape for a few weeks. But if that persists for a very long period of time like everybody else, we may have some issues with device supply. Now, that's not a continuation of this like in any company is not baked into our guidance, but we all hope this is going to be soon resolved. So we put it behind us.","So, thank you again and I look forward to a pretty good 2020.","Nick Rolli","So, thank you very much. That concludes the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations team here in Switzerland. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 second quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the second quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to the [ph]   volume excluding acquisitions, and net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.","You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Thank you, Nick, and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. We again achieved strong underlying business results in the second quarter, with actual results impacted by both unfavorable currency movements and the hurdle we faced in Japan due to our extraordinarily results there during the second quarter last year.","Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was down 1.2% to 238.3 billion units. However, excluding the Japan hurdle of 6.3 billion units, organic cigarette volume was up 1.4%. In addition, our organic volume of other tobacco products increased by 11.8% in the quarter.","Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 2.9% and 3.5%, respectively. Without the Japan hurdle, our growth rates would have been in line with our annual mid- to long-term currency-neutral targets of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8%, respectively.","Adjusted diluted EPS reached $1.36 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of last year and were up by 9%, excluding the currency. If one also takes into consideration the previously disclosed Japan hurdle of $0.10 at an EPS level, then adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, was up by a very strong 17.7% in the second quarter.","Our results for the first half of the year were excellent. Organic cigarette volume was up 1.8%. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI grew by 6.5% and 8.3%, respectively. Finally, adjusted diluted EPS increased by 13.3%, excluding currency.","These results confirm our expectation of solid organic cigarette volume growth in 2012. We have the best geographic footprint in the industry and leadership in both emerging and developed markets. Our volume is growing strongly in many markets in both the Asia and EEMA regions, offsetting weaker volume trends in the EU region due to the deterioration of the economic situation and weaker consumer confidence. Consequently, we expect to continue to grow currency-neutral profitability at a rapid pace, with sustained strong pricing and a favorable product mix only partially offset by an unfavorable geographic mix.","Exchange rates, however, continue to be volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, the forecast currency headwind this year is slightly higher than the $0.25 per share that we predicted in June. However, our underlying business is very strong, and this is expected to offset the additional unfavorable currency impact of $0.02 per share.","We are therefore today reaffirming our reported diluted 2012 EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20 compared to $4.85 in 2011. On a currency-neutral basis, our guidance implies a forecast growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this despite the Japan hurdle and weak industry volume in Europe. Let me remind you that our mid- to long-term currency-neutral annual growth target for adjusted diluted EPS is also 10% to 12%.","As we indicated during our Investor Day last month, cigarette industry volumes in the EU region were unusually depressed in the second quarter. The overall decline was 9.7%, with significant reductions not only in markets such as Greece and Spain, but also in Italy and Poland, with even Germany suffering a 5.1% drop. The decline was driven by a reduction in daily consumption, while smoking incidence has remained relatively stable.","For the first half of the year, cigarette industry volume in the EU region was down 5.8%. This confirms that the second quarter decline was unusually severe as adult smokers adjusted to the renewed recessionary environment and there were some unfavorable timing issues. Our current expectations for the second half of the year is that the decline rate for cigarette industry volume in the EU region should be similar to that experienced during the first half of the year.","The average unemployment rate across the European Union increased by 0.7 points between June 2011 and May 2012, with significantly more pronounced increases in Greece, Spain and Italy. Only Germany showed a meaningful  [indiscernible] .","As a result of the deteriorating job markets, the average unemployment level in the EU stood at 10.3% in May, with Spain and Greece double this level. France and Italy are just below the EU average, while Germany and the Netherlands continue to have relatively low levels of unemployment.","We have always highlighted unemployment levels and trends as key indicators for industry volume. We therefore do not expect a return to the normal underlying decline rate of 2% to 3% in the EU region until the issue is addressed in a meaningful way.","We have achieved a resilient market share performance in the second quarter, with 38.5% overall in the EU region, 0.2 points below the previous year's level. On a half year basis, our share of 37.9% was down 0.4 points.","We are very encouraged by the performance of Marlboro in this difficult economic environment. In the second quarter, Marlboro's share in the region grew by 0.3 points to 18.4%, and it was up slightly on a 6-month basis. Marlboro gained share in the quarter notably in Belgium, Czech Republic, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy and Poland. L&M continued to grow share in such markets as Finland, Germany, Poland and Slovakia, but this was not enough to offset declines in the quarter in Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Chesterfield is performing very well and is being successfully established as a strong second leg for us in the low-price segment in the EU region.","We are rapidly gaining share in the growing fine cut category. Industry volumes increased by nearly 8% in both the second quarter and the first half as adult smokers down-traded to less expensive options. Our share of the fine cut category rose by 1.4 points in the quarter and by 1.7 points in the first half to 14.1% and 14%, respectively.","The market situation in Italy deserves specific attention. Cigarette industry volume in Italy declined by 10.5% in the second quarter and by 8.5% in the first half of 2012. The most important single factor has been a reduction in consumer purchasing power, aggravated by the payment of increased property taxes in June and the increase in cigarette prices over the last 12 months. This unfavorable development in the cigarette industry is not a unique phenomenon as a wide range of consumer products have been affected by the economic slowdown.","Impacting specifically the cigarette industry, there has also been down-trading to the fine cut category and an increase in illicit trade, particularly the so-called illicit whites, with brands such as Jin Ling and Classic. Despite recent price increases, the fine cut category grew by 74.6% in the quarter, though it still represents a relatively modest 6.5% of total tobacco industry volume.","In terms of market share, Marlboro is performing strongly. It gained 0.3 points to reach a 23% share in the quarter, despite the continued pressure on the Premium segment. However, our overall cigarette market share declined in both the quarter and the first half, as the strong performance of Marlboro and the launch of Philip Morris Selection in the low-price segment were unable to offset the decline of our local heritage brand Diana. In contrast, our share in fine cut grew by 24.5 points in the quarter to a record level of 31%, firmly establishing us as the category leader in Italy.","In Germany, cigarette industry volume declined in the quarter by 5.1%. This was attributable to the impact of the recent price increases, a decline in consumer confidence in spite of low unemployment rates, a difficult comparison with the second quarter last year that was up 4.6% and some timing issues. We believe that the first half year decline of 1.3% is a better reflection of the underlying trend.","PMI continued to strong perform strongly with further share gains in the second quarter. Our share in cigarettes was up 0.3 points to 36.4%, and our share in fine cut grew by 1.2 points to 16%. We are very pleased by the improved performance of Marlboro, which gained 0.3 points in the cigarette category and 1.2 points in the fine cut category, while L&M continued to grow share in the cigarette category and Chesterfield gained in both the cigarette and in the fine cut categories.","As a consequence of the industry volume declines, our second quarter results were soft in the EU region. Cigarette volume was down 9.4%, only partially offset by a strong 18.2% growth in OTP volumes. Net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, were down 0.7% and 2.7%, respectively. We were largely able to offset the lower volumes with higher prices. Excluding currency and acquisitions, June year-to-date net revenues increased by 2%, and adjusted OCI was just above the prior-year level on the same basis.","In contrast, we had another very strong quarter in the EEMA region, and our results year-to-date June were equally excellent. In the quarter, organic volume grew by 4.9%, while net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 12.7% and 22.9%, respectively.","While pricing at $114 million continued to be a significant contributor to the growth in EEMA's OCI, it was almost matched in the quarter by our $104 million volume\/mix variance. This is in fact the fifth consecutive quarter of positive volume\/mix in the region.","This was driven by the strength of our brand portfolio, with a particularly encouraging performance of our premium brands, with volume up 7.4% in the second quarter. Overall, 9 of our top 10 brands in that EEMA region grew volume in the quarter, with just Chesterfield down. Marlboro had a strong quarter, with a volume gain of over 1 billion units or 5%, driven mainly by North Africa, Saudi Arabia and Serbia. The performance of Parliament was truly outstanding, with volume up 1.1 billion units or 16.3%, driven mainly by Eastern Europe and Turkey.","On a market basis, our strong results were led by Russia, so let me provide you with further details on this important market.","Though we do not have definitive data yet, we believe that the Russian cigarette market grew slightly during the first half of the year. We attribute this to an improvement in the economy and a return of foreign workers as the construction industry has started to pick up again. As a result of recent price increases in cigarettes, foreseen hikes in utility prices and the slightly slower expected economic growth in the second half of the year, we forecast that full-year industry cigarette volume should reach a level similar to last year's.","We are outpacing industry volume. During the second quarter, our volume increased at a much faster rate of 8.7% and was 5% higher in the first half.  Two very important positive aspects of the Russian market were uptrading by adult smokers in spite of significant price increases and our ability to gain market share, thanks to the strength and breadth of our brand portfolio. For the quarter through the end of May, our market share was 0.7 points higher at 26.1%, thanks to the strong performance of Parliament, L&M, Bond Street and Next.","We took a further price increase of RUB 3 per pack across our portfolio in July.","We launched Marlboro ClearTaste in Russia in June. This is a much smoother-tasting line of products, which addresses adult smoker product preference. We started the launch in key cities and have already achieved outstanding distribution at point of sale. Initial consumer feedback and trial data are positive. It will of course take several months before we can draw any firm conclusions.","Our performance in the Asia region was again very strong in the second quarter. This was however masked by the aforementioned hurdle in Japan.","Our organic cigarette volume in the quarter was up 7.4%, excluding the Japan hurdle, driven primarily by Indonesia, though down 0.7% on a reported basis. Likewise, excluding the Japan hurdle, adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, would have shown a strong increase, but it was down 2.6% including the full comparison for Japan.","Industry volume in Japan increased by nearly 10% in the second quarter compared to the distorted period last year. For 2012, we are now forecasting a stable total market, though the underlying trend remains a moderate decline of 1% to 2% a year going forward.","During the first half of this year, Japan Tobacco accelerated its program of new launches, and this has had some impact on our market share, which reached 27.8% in the second quarter. This was 0.2 points lower than the previous quarter but still substantially above the pre-earthquake share levels.","Lark Hybrid 100s maintained an 0.4% market share, and we launched Marlboro Black Menthol Edge 8 and Marlboro Menthol Edge 1 during the second quarter. Our latest launch this month is Marlboro Ice Blast in 5-milligram and 1-milligram variants, 8-milligram variant having achieved a 1.3% market share during the second quarter. With these efforts and additional new launches in the pipeline, we are confident that we should be able to stabilize our market position going forward.","On the fiscal front, the Japanese government obtained Parliamentary approval for a two-step increase in consumption tax from 5% today to 8% in 2014 and 10% in 2015. While prices remain government-controlled, the last tax increases resulted in margin-enhancing price increases.","Volumes continued to grow in the second quarter in Indonesia, albeit as expected at a slower rate than in the first quarter. Industry volume grew by 6.9% in the second quarter, while PMI volume increased by 17.8%. Supported by a strong economy, adult smokers have been uptrading to the Premium segment, which has grown by 2 points in the first 6 months this year.","PMI has the strongest and broadest portfolio in the Indonesian market, along with an unmatched national distribution network and highly qualified and motivated employees. Our market share grew by 3.1 points in the quarter to 33.5% as Sampoerna A remained the fastest-growing brand in terms of share gains, with an increase of 1.2 points to 13.1%, and we continued to benefit from rounded price points.","Going forward, we forecast a market growth of around 8% for the full year and look for further PMI share growth, though at a slower pace than in the first half of this year.","Pricing continues to be the most important single driver of PMI's profitability. The pricing variance was $463 million in the quarter, giving a half year pricing variance of $832 million. This year, we have increased prices notably in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Spain and Ukraine.","Our volume\/mix variance was obviously negative in the quarter due to the Japan hurdle. However, as you can see on the chart, excluding the hurdle, 8 of our top 10 brands grew volume in the first half of the year and the other 2 were essentially stable. In volume terms, Marlboro achieved the largest growth, while in percentage terms, Fortune, Sampoerna A, Parliament and Lark all recorded double-digit growth.","We are continuing to expand our market share in our top 30 OCI markets. Our June 3-month moving average share of 36.9% is above both our 12-month moving share and the 2011 results and 1.4 share points above the 2010 share level.","Free cash flow declined in the second quarter by $703 million to $3.2 billion. Unfavorable currency movements were responsible for over half this decrease. In addition, we built up finished goods stock in Brazil and Russia, and working capital consequently increased by $388 million. This will be reversed during the third quarter when this inventory is sold.","During the second quarter, we spent a further $1.5 billion to repurchase 17.8 million shares. In June, the board approved a new 3-year $18 billion share repurchase program, which will start in August when funds from the previous program will have been fully utilized ahead of schedule. Our target remains to spend $6 billion on share repurchases this year.","Since the spin [ph] through the end of June this year, we spent $24.4 billion to repurchase 449.9 million shares, representing 21.3% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin [ph] at an average price of $54.21.","In conclusion, the second quarter of 2012 was, as expected, a very strong one in terms of underlying business momentum, but a challenging one in terms of reported results due to the Japan hurdle and unfavorable currency movements.","As we foresaw during our June Investor Day, EEMA and Asia region results were very strong in the second quarter, enabling us to offset unusually weak cigarette industry volume in the EU region.","The breadth of our geographic footprint, the continued strong pricing environment based on our superior brand portfolio and productivity gains enabled us to grow both net revenues and adjusted OCI in the second quarter, excluding currency and acquisitions.","Adjusted diluted EPS, ex currency, increased by 9% in the second quarter. If the $0.10 hurdle related to Japan were excluded, the increase in adjusted diluted EPS, ex currency, was a very substantial 17.7%, confirming the overall strength of our business.","We have reaffirmed today our 2012 reported diluted EPS guidance of $5.10 to $5.20. Compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88 in 2011, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency.","Thank you. I'll be happy to answer your questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Two things I wanted to ask you. First, in the EU, do you think that you can maintain on a local currency basis the overall profitability of the business for the foreseeable future if volume declines persist at these above trend rates, maybe not the rate in the second quarter but at higher than historical rates of decline?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, I'd say for this year -- I mean, for the second half we expect a similar decline, but at the same time, we continue to be cautiously optimistic to achieve low single-digit OCI growth, excluding currency, nevertheless. In the EU region, in years before where we had similar decline rates, we had similar results. Yes, we see continued market declines there, but there are also, talking for this year, also several positives in there. In Italy, there was still the potential VAT increase looming in September that has been called off, postponed to next year but who knows what happens until September of 2013. But it's not going to happen this year. In Spain, the VAT increase of 3% on all goods is being compensated for cigarettes by ad valorem decrease. That's good news, too, of course. And in France, some sort of price increase is going to come in the remainder of the year, and despite this economic trouble in the entire region, the Marlboro share is actually up. So overall, yes, I think we can do that, we can still achieve low single-digit OCI growth also in the EU region.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then second question, Hermann. Can you just update us all on the status of the potential excise tax increase in the Philippines and the potential for fairly substantial duty increase potentially in the GCC countries?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. Philippines first. The situation there is that the House of Representatives has passed a bill with pretty substantial disruptive excise increases for 2013. Thereafter, even in that bill, the positive is that it takes a multiyear approach, but that is for now the House of Representatives. The legislative processes is by far not being closed. After the summer recess, first the Senate is expected to weigh in on the question. Then should there be disagreement between Senate and House of Representatives, then it goes into the so-called bicameral committee. So what I'm telling you here is there is more discussions to come in the third and in the fourth quarter. Then on GCC, while there is a discussion going on, that discussion we have had many years also -- for many years also in the past, it's still an open question. I really don't have an update to that one. We'll see in the remainder of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the Philippines. Thanks for the update on the tax situation, which is helpful, but could you provide just a little more color on the current market dynamics just in terms of the market declining there, what's going on and how you expect this to evolve as the year unfolds and into next year?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, okay. First of all, I mean, let me start then with the economy. I see that the economic outlook in the Philippines, which is actually brilliant, I mean, the GDP, the last number I saw, I believe that was the quarter 1 number, up 6.4%, with an inflation, I think it has been May, a little less than 3%. Remittances of Filipinos working abroad, up substantially in 1 month. That's about an amount of $1.7 billion coming to the country. Therefore, I mean, in terms of consumer environment, that's actually pretty good. That translates now in the total market that for the full year, we would expect a slight growth. So I would say the full year market, about 100 billion cigarettes. Last year was 97.5 billion roughly. So a slight increase therefore in the total market despite the price increases that was there. In terms of shares, yes, share, we lost a bit of share, and we lost that share essentially to some local company there, which, let me put it this way, sells at surprisingly low prices.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Hermann, just a second question on your Be Marlboro campaign. Could you give us just further details on the rollout and then maybe a little more color on just some key markets where this campaign has been having a positive impact on Marlboro?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, first of all, it is, of course where it started it's in the German market, where it has been doing tremendously well, continues to do tremendously well. I mean, it is -- as you know, it is the continuation at the end of the day and the translation into modern values of what was the Marlboro campaign, the cowboy campaign stood for. So it's receiving excellent feedback, continues to receive excellent consumer feedback in the German market. In adaptations, you will find it in more and more markets around the world. It's not always going to be exactly the same what you see in Germany, but it's the same idea, the same philosophy behind. And we will roll it out from there. It has started in some Latin American markets, and it will go further. It is the new worldwide campaign.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First, in Japan, so the consumption tax proposals that you've talked about in Japan, other than the consumption tax increases, are there any discussions of national or regional tax increases that are being discussed at this point?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well not regional, what will come later in the year is, of course, a discussion on the excise tax outlook. Typically, as the budgetary year of the government goes from 1st of April to the end of March, there, as you, of course,  [indiscernible]  These discussions will start in December, with a decision kind of by year-end. At this point in time, I really couldn't predict the outcome there, but it is obvious and clear that we will be advocating for a multiyear excise tax plan, which would be beneficial for both the government in their quest to maximize revenues and could also be profitable for us at the same time.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Is there anything to glean from the fact that they did approve the other consumption tax increase?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes, I would say it is a positive there, it is a first step to developing an entire refinancing plan, if you like, for all the funds needed to cope with the cost of the natural disaster of last year. So in that context, the discussions take place. Consumption tax was, of course, the key element in there. Excise tax, I believe, is going to be a normal discussion. It will not be dominated by that question on the consumption tax. To put that a bit into the context, that's something that is going to be manageable for us. It always depends of course what you assume to be the price level when the consumption tax kicks in at that time, April 2014 and October 2015. But kind of the first increase means a rollover of about JPY 15, and the second one means a rollover of about JPY 10 per pack. That's manageable, of course.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay. And you've talked about the market in Japan, the market consumption decline this year being now more stable. Can you just talk about why at least this year the market seems to be doing better than expected?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, at the first quarter call, I think I still expected 1% to 2% decline there. It's of course -- to be honest, it's a hard market to read with all the distortions from last year into this year. We had a prolonged period where incidence -- smoking incidence had stayed stable. It has come down a little bit the last 2 months but not much. So that's why I think that the underlying, really, is probably a 1% to 2% decline going forward. Now I'm talking next years and thereafter. That's of course [indiscernible] pricing. I'm talking about the underlying trend. But this year, when we take it all together, the obvious estimate is now [ph] that it should be about flat.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of your guidance, so if you look at first half, your adjusted earnings up 13.3%, excluding currency, even with the hurdle that you faced in second quarter from Japan. It sounds like, just based on your guidance, maybe a little bit of a slowdown in the back half. I'm just wondering if there are any other factors that sort of makes you think that the earnings growth could slow down in the back half. Are you thinking just in terms of Europe potentially a bit more conservative stance? I'm just wondering if there's anything to think about in the back half.","Hermann G. Waldemer","No, I mean, there is nothing on the underlying business trends there. It is simply some -- often a question of comparisons. If I take the Japan hurdle out, then organic volume in the first half has been going 3.3%. I mean, I can't expect 3.3% for the full year, I think nobody does, although we are optimistic to achieve our mid- to long-term organic volume growth target of 1% despite the hurdle in Japan. To give you one example of tough comps, if you go to the EEMA region, then the first half volume results compared to declining trends in the first half of 2011, whilst the second half of the year will compare to already an overall growth rate of 2.4% in the second half of 2011 last year in that region. So it's a bit of comps, but underlying our business is in very good shape. And Europe has, of course, been factored in into our full year guidance.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kieley with Deutsche Bank.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just going back to Europe and Southern Europe specifically, could you just talk about if the volume trend in those countries has changed much compared to what you indicated at the Investor Day? And what gives you confidence that the volume in Southern Europe will have been most weakest this quarter and then stabilize more in the second half?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. Well, it seems they have not really changed much compared to the Investor Day projections. The quarter has come out slightly worse than what we already had highlighted there. I mean, in terms of market sizes, then the best will be we go to the biggest markets there. Germany, which has been down in the second quarter by 5.2%, is down on a year-to-date basis 1.3%. I would say in Germany, expect about 1.5% for the full year. So the 5% are not representative at all in that sense. Italy is a complicated market these days. I mean, I had it in my prepared remarks, austerity measures and consumer confidence going down, doesn't make it easier. However, I would say for the full market for Italy, I would expect something like 7.5%, maybe 8% decline. The first quarter was down 6%, the second quarter was down 10.5%. 7.5% [ph] to 8% could be a full year number there in Italy. Spain, I think the forecast that we had of something in the range of 10% for the full year outlook is still a reasonable assumption. It is, of course, was very important that the VAT increase has been offset by reduced ad valorem rates. Therefore, in that context, I think the minus 10% for Spain is still a realistic number. If I add in then France, there I would say take out the technical factors and stuff. Something like 3% is probably a realistic assumption for France.","Andrew Kieley - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question I had is just your commentary in the guidance, the language about the anticipated business improvement in Asia and EEMA regions. Does that mean -- I mean, it sounds like that's mainly -- you're seeing better macro trends in Russia, your growth in Indonesia. Are there any other specific positives that you are calling out in those 2 regions?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, we just raised our prices by RUB 3 in Russia in July. That plays into that one as well. But other than that, yes, I mean, the overall environment is really good. The economic environment is kind of the antipode of what we see in the EU region. And with the right portfolios, the right brands, we are benefiting from those trends in those parts of the world.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Hermann, I want to ask you 2 questions, if I could. The first was a bit of a follow-on to Japan, and it sounds like you're now expecting sort of share stabilization there for the year. And really just more a question about why. Do you have less new productivity or are you seeing a little bit more competitive activity, of course, out of Japan Tobacco? Maybe it's a combination of factors, but I just want to get a little more perspective on your expectation for share in Japan.","Hermann G. Waldemer","We had a very slight loss here. I mean, we came down from 28% to 27.8%. That's a slight loss. We are competitive people. We don't like that. But one also has to acknowledge that competitors are not asleep on the switch either. We have had a very successful launch with Marlboro Black Menthol, as you remember. JT has come out now also with a successful highly mentholated product that they pushed into the market, that has had some share consequence on us, but that's the second quarter. As I said, we are already out there in July. Our sales with new launches with 5-milligram and 1-milligram versions of Marlboro Ice Blast. The 8-milligram version is the one that has 1.3% share, which is after such a not-so-long period in the market a fantastic share. But competition will go on, and we're never afraid of competition. But we take also the other  [indiscernible]  Serious, that's all there is.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","It sounds like it's not a change though. And so your new product introductions are plans for, say, the second half of the year though. Correct?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No, we have still more in the pipeline for the second half of the year, of course.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just want to be clear on that. And then I just had a question for you, a follow-up on the EU. Obviously, we had obviously a difficult quarter this quarter, an expectation for that to improve a bit from where we were this quarter. And I want to be clear. In the second quarter, were there any -- was there any negative effect on volumes from inventory distortions or movements that made this quarter look a little worse than what the underlying results would have shown?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I mean, Germany has been comparing to the second quarter in 2011. That was up by 4.6%, and it happens to be that Easter is in the first quarter and in the second quarter from 1 year to the next. That's just very, very technical there. So yes, there were some inventory movements in there. And typically, at quarter ends, you sometimes see intense activity of some competitors with the trades, which we don't do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Hermann, you flagged the problem of illicit trade in Italy. Has the problem of illicit trade in Spain got worse in Q2?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Illicit trade in Spain should be about 10%, 12%. I would assume there, so it's increased -- it's on the increase there as well.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. My second question, Hermann, is whether you could give us some color on the phasing of marketing spend this year. Should we expect any change to the usual skew towards second half and Q4 in particular?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No, I wouldn't expect a change in general trends there. It's really -- it's kind of a lot of activities going to the second quarter before the summer break, and then you have -- it's picking up towards year-end. That's a very normal pattern which has not changed over the years. I don't see a change now either.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And my last question is just any early reading on volume trends in Brazil, both the tax-driven price increase and the minimum price.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Sorry, volume trends in Brazil, you said?","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","That's correct.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Brazil. Okay. Well, in Brazil, you of course have now had -- the pricing is implemented, the tax increase was made first. All the prices are there. We do see an adherence of local manufacturers to the new minimum price of BRL 3 there, but as the minimum price is still relatively low, I think the real effect will only come with the already scheduled and foreseen minimum price increases over the years. We don't see, however, really, an improvement on the illicit product flowing in from Paraguay into Brazil.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Hermann, I would have expected L&M to do a little bit better in the EU, given that there's probably down-trading going on. What am I missing there?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, sometimes you can't have it all. Marlboro is doing better. I think the 2 are a bit linked now. But seriously, that's -- L&M did nothing wrong. The brand is going well. In Germany, the growth has -- it's still growing, but it has slowed down a little bit. But that's fine with me it's recuperated with Marlboro. And then when you go over to Spain, well, in Spain, the declines there in Spain are actually linked to brands that absorb part of the minimum tax today there. I'm talking about brands that fell at less than EUR 3.55. This is today the kick-in with minimum tax. That kick-in actually is going to EUR 3.77 of September 1. So I look forward to that date.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in Japan, at what point do you think the innovation disadvantage that you have relative to JT right now? At what point will that start to fade?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I would say that I just admitted that they have had a real hit with the highly mentholated product that has come out under Mild Seven. We have  [indiscernible] had a series of very good ones, too. We will keep on working on our new launches, and being competitive in the market. A onetime hit does not change this plan.","Thilo Wrede - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question I have for you. With illicit trade picking up again in Canada, is that a cautionary tale that may be a sustainable fighting of illicit trade is much harder than some short-term successes might imply?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Honestly, to the contrary, although you might further elaborate thereafter, to the contrary, I have big hopes that illicit trade will come further down in Canada because the province of Ontario has declared that they are essentially copying the measures that the province of Qu\u00e9bec had implemented, was it now 2 years ago, which have brought quite a bit of volume back into the legal tax-paying market. So as the enforcements in Ontario kicks in and the total illicit trade in Ontario is estimated to be about 4 billion cigarettes, so quite a bit of that could come through and the legal market could benefit from that. So honestly, I would expect the opposite going forward in Canada.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","My first question has to do with the launch of the new Marlboro line in Russia. You guys posted volume growth on the Marlboro brand in that market for the first time in a number of quarters, and I'm curious if you could give us a sense of how much of that growth was from the selling of the new products versus any kind of underlying benefit to organic volumes for Marlboro.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes. In the second quarter on Marlboro ClearTaste, there is, of course -- and now we talk shipment numbers. We don't talk Nielsen numbers, we talk shipment numbers. It's still, of course, a pipelining effect, bringing the product to the distributor, and from there, into wholesale and retail trade. The volume, total volume increase in the EEMA region in the quarter was 3.8 billion cigarettes. Out of that, roughly 10% has been Marlboro ClearTaste. So yes, it's there. It's some pipelining effect, but it's just 10% of the overall growth.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Understood. My next question again on EEMA has to do with Turkey. At your Analyst Day, you highlighted some early successes in reductions in the illicit trade, and it sounds like that was, again, a benefit onto the Turkish market in the quarter. Given the acceleration you've seen there -- I think 4.5% roughly year-to-date volume growth for the industry -- do you have a sense of how much volume is coming back into that market?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes, our latest estimate is that illicit trade has come down by about 3 percentage points, national average from 20% actually to 17%. That's our latest estimate, these are of course by definition always estimates. So the 4% growth that you quoted, that's actually a good estimate for the full year. So I would expect the total market to be in the range of 95 billion cigarettes.","Vivien Azer - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wonderful. And my last question has to do with Spain. And I hate to split hairs here, Hermann, but if I think about your outlook for the full year of 10% in line with year-to-date and I look at the comps that you face, I think it implies some kind of improvement in the back half of the year because 1 half of '11, the market was down 19%, and then you finished the year, down 17%. So is it the VAT change or is there something else that gets you on the margin incrementally more positive that despite a tougher comp, you can maintain the trend?","Hermann G. Waldemer","[indiscernible] There's a multitude of factors at play here. There were the price increases that we have seen, several ones that you remember. There is now -- there hasn't been a price increase now for a while, and the VAT threat has been avoided. Then in terms of comparisons, it was also a question of how much volume is in retail trades. But at the end of the day, that's the best estimate we have coming out of the Spanish market. Can it be 11%? Can it be 12%? It could, but we talk something around 10% for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg Bank.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","I'd like to ask about the plain packaging, and I'm wondering if there's a difference in the WTO challenge, having the Dominican Republic file a complaint. Does this mean that there's more momentum in the formal adjudication panel? And then secondly, is there any read through from that to what may happen in the U.K. with the consultation underway and then perhaps with the results some time toward the end of this year, beginning of next year?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. I mean, on plain packaging, you have actually mentioned 2 of the 3 developments in that area. The WTO claim of the DR that has now officially filed a request for consultation with Australia, actually, I believe yesterday or the day before yesterday. That adds another country and it adds more doubt and pressure into the procedure. We continue to be optimistic that more countries will actually follow that example, so that put simply more weight into the WTO claims between those governments. On the U.K., the extension of the consultation period by another month now to mid-August because that was supposed to end mid-July, is simply driven that a lot of people have made submissions and continue to make submissions to the government. I take it as a sign that the government is serious about their evaluation efforts in that process. And if that is all happening on a rational basis -- and I continue to think that this is the case, then I would also expect that the U.K. government comes to the same rational conclusion as they came 2.5 years ago not to implement. The third new element, the new one is actually under the bilateral investment treaty claim that Philip Morris has. The first procedural hearing is actually now scheduled for July 30 in Singapore.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","And then coming back to the Turkish market, could you update us on the outlook for any tax increases at the end of this year, beginning of next year? Are they thinking about raising the ad valorem again or is that somewhat off the table?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. Remember, when we were here at the first quarter call, there we had had the press statement of the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister that they will address the excise tax structure. That has happened. The Council of Ministers has authorized specific tax to be implemented to an amount of up to 20% of the minimum excise tax. The timing and the actual percentage and amounts, that's still to be defined, but I would expect it still this year. So I think that is a positive development and a sign of rationality in the whole process.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ann Gurkin with Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was wondering if you could just help me with the Marlboro brand franchise. We saw volume flow sequentially from Q1 to Q2, and we saw good share of growth continuing in Q2. But how should I think about that franchise in the second half, the impact of market pricing innovation? Can you just help me think about volume and share progression as the year unfolds?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, first of all, I mean, really, I mean, not even the quarter  [indiscernible] year-to-date. Yes, for Asia, I have to pick the hurdle out. But excluding the hurdle in Asia, Marlboro is up 0.24 to 6.2%. That's all year-to-date June numbers. In the EU, it's up 0.3 to 18.4. In EEMA, it's up 0.1 to 6.9, despite still measured by Nielsen declines in Russia. Latin America, up 0.4 to 14.2. So yes, it's growing. It's also growing in terms of shipments. So even year-to-date, excluding -- including the hurdle, it's up 1.7. Excluding the hurdle, it's up 2.9. And if I then move over to really to the big markets, where it's really substantially up, then you have there -- first of all, I would think of Mexico. It's growing -- I mean, the quarter, 1.2 percentage points to 53.2. I mean, the brand is in terrific shape there. It's growing by 0.9% in Poland. In Poland, you see a phenomenon that the top 10 brands really capture more and more of the market volume, and you see a consolidation into fewer brands. That's clear uptrading [ph] potential for us and for a Marlboro  [indiscernible] element there. Germany, we talked about earlier on the call. Italy, it's growing despite recessionary environment. And 0.3 percentage point to 4.5 in Indonesia, given the size of the Indonesian market, it's quite some volume. Then you go to those markets where Marlboro is actually down, and there are very specific reasons in there, understandable reasons, which are not there to be forever. Korea, it's down 0.9 to 7.7, while that is clearly driven by our price increases that we implemented and we compare still to the periods that we had price advantage versus international competitors and were at par with the Korean competitors. In France, it's down 0.8 in the quarter to 25.2, very simply driven by the fact that Marlboro is the only big brand who is retailing at above EUR 6. There are a lot of brands retail below EUR 6. As I mentioned earlier, there's a price increase coming up in France. And in Spain, the decline -- in such a recessionary environment, what else could we expect? But take it all together, driven by the innovation, driven by new campaigns, driven by better execution on the marketing and sales level, a new commercial approach, Marlboro is doing well. Pockets of weakness like Russia exist, and we work on those. I'm very positive on Marlboro overall.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","So tracking where you all would expect for the year? Is that fair?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Could you say again? I could not hear.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Is it tracking in line with expectations for the year, Marlboro, overall for the first half?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Absolutely. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Hermann, just one last clarification on the EU. Not to beat this thing to death, but it does sound like you're indicating broadly across the segment that I guess the first half volume numbers may be a better indicator of what the go forward looks like than are the Q2 numbers, right? Even though it looks like things have continued to worsen, especially from a macro perspective, and the number was a little worse than you even thought a month ago. So I guess can you, I guess, give a little bit more color on what the inventory\/timing piece of the EU is that will cause Q3 and Q4 to get better than Q2? I'm just trying to understand why we'd think that, that first half number is a better indicator than the more recent Q2 number.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, I mean, there is many markets in there. And as I said earlier, Germany is just -- I think it's the most flagrant example there. I mean, you had Q2 down by 5.2, whereas year-to-date, it's down by 1.3. And our full-year estimate for the German market is down 1.5. So you have this technical reason in the second quarter where in Q2 2011, you compare to an up of 4.6%. These are comps. Let's not get hung up too much really on quarters. Year-to-date trends are the more reliable indicator. I'm not talking it rosy here. Yes, EU region is not easy, but there is no reason to believe that the EU region is now going to be down 10% for the rest of the year. It's not going to be down 10% for the year, it's going to be down in the range of where the year-to-date is, which is anything around 6.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Avery with CLSA.","Michael Avery","One quick question. You had said your estimate for the increase in leaf costs was around 2% for 2012. Has that changed at all with the drought in the U.S.? Is there upward pressure on that?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No. I mean, what we see there really is about 2%, 2.5%. 2.5%, I think, is the most realistic number of the kilo prices going up. The drought in the U.S., I mean, this is a worldwide business. One individual geography does not change total trends. So maybe marginally but not substantially.","Michael Avery","Okay, that's helpful. And then you had cited Thailand and Vietnam as a couple of the drivers for growth in Asia. Those are obviously relatively small markets for you, but can you give a little color on what's going on there? Were they up quite a lot to be worth mentioning? What sort of growth that you're seeing there?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Vietnam, remember, we have kind of restructured a bit our business set up there last year, which has given us a better influence on marketing and sales of our products. We are actually from a very low place, almost doubling volumes in that market, but admittedly from a low base. We concentrate on the 5 or 6 big cities. The best example that highlights the future growth potential is actually that in the city of Hanoi, we now have a market share of about 15%. So there's plenty of possibility going forward. Thailand is a bit more a volatile environment where we are up against a well-protected Thai monopoly. But we have good trends there, but it's a bit more complicated there, I would say.","Michael Avery","Well, that's helpful. And lastly, just in Indonesia, obviously, the volume growth there is very strong. What kind of pricing gain did you see in the quarter?","Hermann G. Waldemer","In Indonesia, the way we implement pricing in Indonesia is actually that we increased several times over the year. That can be anything between 5 to 8x on average per year. Our trading price is into the wholesale trade. So it's not like in many other places where you have whatever an excise increase and the morning thereafter all the prices changes. So Indonesia has constant pricing throughout the year.","Michael Avery","So that just continued like normally [indiscernible]?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes. There's nothing particular there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.","David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Two, if I can. Just coming back to this, the guidance not changing. Obviously, as you made the point, the EU was a little bit worse since we saw you in June. The currency obviously got a little bit worse as well. Could you just be a little bit more specific about which markets have got better over the last, I guess, 4 to 6 weeks that leave you confident that you're still in that range? Or was there a little bit of comfort baked into the previous guidance and you're just not through that level yet? And then secondly, just following up on the Indonesian point. Clearly, that's been a huge successful year both in terms of the market but your market share performance. Are you seeing anything from competitors in terms of trying to arrest that market share momentum that you seeing? Or would you be confident that, that will continue, given what you're doing there through the second half in terms of market share?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Let me start with Indonesia. As I said [indiscernible] before, I mean, we don't -- nobody can expect continued share growth in the range of 3 percentage points all the way along. We have said that this is going to slow down a bit. But that being said, I'm just convinced that we have the best company there, we have the best brands, we have great management, we have great employees, we have great distribution. We're just doing extremely well. And overall, the pricing environment is rational, the government, yes, is increasing excise taxes every year but has not done that for years in a disruptive manner. So the elements are all there for a very positive performance to continue in the Indonesian market. And then for your first question on the overall guidance, I mean, let me answer that way. We are all very pleased to see that our Asian growth engine is now complemented by very strong performance also in Eastern Europe.","David Hayes - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. Is that Russia? I mean, it sounds like the presentation in the release that maybe Russian trends were stepping up a little bit in the last and then I guess your performance there with the investment behind Marlboro. Is that one of the key markets to your point that's kind of got better than you were hoping for over the last couple of months?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Russia, by its sheer size, of course, is the most important market in the EEMA region. But there is also Turkey, there is also Ukraine, there is Kazakhstan, there is North Africa, there is the GCC countries, which are also very prosperous countries with growing population and growing purchasing power. So there are many places in that region. Of course Russia is the most important but there are many others.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Karen Lamark with Federated Investors.","Karen Lamark","Just wanted to go back to the EU and ask you to comment on how you see the balance of volume and pricing in light of apparent increase in price elasticity and the illicit trade. And really, what I'm trying to get at is whether or not these conditions and competitive dynamics might warrant a change in thinking about pricing, particularly if macro pressures seem, as they do, seem likely to persist.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Honestly, I don't think so because when it comes to pricing, then the first thing you need to think about is excise tax, and governments all across Europe have been rational. I think there can't be a more convincing example of the very recent one in Spain that disruptive measures do not maximize excise revenues, but regular moderate steps maximize excise revenues. That is, at the same time, the best not only for the governments, but also the best for industry competitors like ours. So I do not see a change in the rational environment. You have seen a continuation of that rational environment. If you look back over the last 2 years, the European crisis is already going on for a little longer and then the last 6 months. And I see no sign why that all of a sudden would turn and change into an unreasonable environment. I can't see that.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo & Gardner.","Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner","My 2 quick questions. Can you spend a second talking about the role of Lark in Japan? It seems like the brand that's most impacted by the Japan hurdle and tell us about the strength of Lark and the innovation applied to Lark in Japan. And then the second question was just to look for an update, any kind of narrative on the next generation of products that you tipped [ph] us to recently and whether there's been anything newsworthy.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. I mean, on Lark in Japan, let me put it this way. Lark is more of a traditional brand, more of a Japanese brand, as funny as that might sound. And that's why it's probably a little bit more vulnerable than a truly international brand like Marlboro is. That's why successful launches of competitors, as the one I was quoting, probably is putting more of a dent into a Lark than it eventually could put into a Marlboro. That being said, it has been a big growth driver last year. So everything has 2 sides. So we did have a lot of additional smokers into Lark during the special situation, the crisis of last year. In terms of NGPs, there's really nothing new to report compared to our presentations that we had at our Investor Day, really, only a month ago.","Operator","That was our final question. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. I'd like to close with some personal remarks here. It was an exciting journey over the last 5 years, which started with preparing the spinoff, the spinoff itself, and then life as an independent company. Quoted at the stock exchange has been a wonderful period of my life. It was a great pleasure for me to work with you all. And more importantly, to get to know you, the analysts following our company and many of our investors. Let me thank you for your confidence and trust over these years.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome, thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 fourth quarter and full year results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012 and comparing them to the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating Companies Income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles.","You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit, and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures which are posted on our website.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the Forward-Looking and Cautionary Statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Louis Camilleri, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer who will join Louis for the question-and-answer period. Louis?","Louis Camilleri","Thank you, Nick and good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. As expected, we finished 2012 on a very strong note with fourth quarter organic cigarette volume growth of 2.9%; net revenues and adjusted Operating Companies Income or OCI both excluding currency and acquisitions increasing by 6.4% and 12.3% respectively; and adjusted diluted earnings per share growing by 16.4% excluding currency.","Our strong volume performance was partially flattered by some favorable inventory movements, which we estimate added some 60 basis points to our 2.9% growth rate. Cigarette volume for the full year reached 927 billion units, an increase of 1.3% on an organic basis. The solid performance reflects the breadth of our geographic coverage, our excellent balance between emerging and developed markets, and our superior brand portfolio.","The key volume drivers were the EEMA and Asia regions, where we realized organic volume growth of 4.6% and 4.2% respectively, which more than offset a 13.5 billion unit or 6.4% volume erosion in the European Union region, reflecting a decline in cigarette industry volume due to continued economic woes particularly in Southern European markets.","In 2012, we achieved strong market share performances across all four regions with gains of close to 1 share point in the Asia, EEMA, and Latin America and Canada regions, and an essentially unchanged share in the European Union region despite significant competitive trade loading in Germany at the end of the years. As a result our global market share excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.5 percentage points to a record 28.8% in 2012. Our global volume and share performance should be solid in 2013 and we anticipate organic volume growth of up to 1% excluding the Philippines. Continued strong pricing across all four regions was the key driver of our revenue and OCI growth. Generating a favorable variance of $1.8 billion in 2012.We incurred a slightly unfavorable volume mix variance, with positive volumes, stable brand mix and an unfavorable geographic mix. Indeed absent the Japan hurdle, our volume mix variance would have been positive which we view as a significant achievement. In addition we increased our investments in the business notably in Germany, Indonesia and Russia focusing in particular on our key brands in market field forces and infrastructures.In 2012 net revenues grew by 5.6% excluding currency and acquisitions, on the same basis adjusted operating companies income increased by over $1.1 billion or 8.1%. These growth rates were at the high end of our mid to long term currency neutral annual growth targets of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8% respectively.Our strong business results and our substantial share repurchase programs, enable us to increase our adjusted diluted earnings per share to a level of $5.22 in 2012 representing a growth rate of 11.7% excluding an unfavorable currency impact of $0.23 per share. We entered 2013 with strong business fundamentals and excellence trends and we\u2019re optimistic on the prospects of our business. With the recent exception of the Japanese Yen exchange rates have generally stabilized compared to 2012 and we\u2019re forecasting a currency headwind of approximately $0.06 per share in 2013 at prevailing rates. We must recognize however that currency rates remain volatile. Our reported diluted earnings per share guidance of prevailing exchange rates is in a range of $5.68 to $5.78 versus $5.17 in 2012.This corresponds to a growth rate excluding currency of 10% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22 in 2012. Thus we again expect to meet our mid-to-long term currency neutral annual EPS growth target in 2013. This would be the six consecutive years of achieving this target. This guidance factors in the expected impact of the disruptively large excise tax increase that took place at the beginning of this year in the Philippines. The new law increase the excise tax on premium price Marlboro and low price Fortune from 12 to 25 pesos and from 2.72 to 12 pesos per pack respectively.In a response we have increased the recommended retail price per pack of Marlboro from 32 to 51 pesos and that of Fortune from 15 to 25.5 pesos. It will take several months before we can accurately gauge the actual impact of such pricing on total industry volume and on potential consumer down trading.The volume impact however is expected to be considerable in a range of 20% to 25%. We nevertheless anticipate that the impact on our earnings will be marginal given our pricing actions. I would like to say a few words about one of the key regulatory challenges that we\u2019re facing, the European Union\u2019s proposed new tobacco products directives or TPD.Let me emphasize at this stage, it is a proposal, the content of which still has to be approved by both the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. During this review process, it maybe amended and the final outcome remains uncertain. Once the consensus is reached by both the Council and the Parliament, the TPD has to be transposed into local laws by each member state. The European Commission has indicated that it expects that it will take through 2014 to reach an agreement and the full implementation will only incur in 2015 or even 2016.The proposed TPD does not mandate plain packaging as was feared, but it does contain a number of proposals that we believe have no credible scientific basis and would be counterproductive. These relate both to products and their packaging. It calls notably for a ban on menthol and slimmer cigarettes and the introduction of 75% graphic health warnings. Menthol and slimmer cigarettes accounted for approximately 10% of European Union cigarette industry volume in 2012 though in markets such as Poland accounted for about one-third of consumption. We believe that such measures would inevitably lead to both an increase in illicit trade and a reduction in government revenues with no benefit to public health. Rest assured that we will do everything in our power to ensure that reason prevails and that the obvious unintended consequences of the current draft do not materialize.As mentioned earlier, we expect to achieve organic cigarette volume growth, excluding the Philippines in 2013. Strong volume growth in the EEMA regions and the other Asian markets is forecast to more than offset continued volume declines in the European Union region, where no significant overall improvement is foreseen until the current high levels of unemployment are meaningfully reduced. Our key premium brands Marlboro and Parliament are performing strongly, as volume and share are expanding across a wide range of geographies. Our overall brand portfolio is in excellent shape with a strong complementary presence in profitable mid and low priced segments.The global excise tax environment remains reasonable with the obvious exception of the Philippines and the pricing environment continues to be favorable. Pricing will again be the key growth driver of our earnings. Some 75% of our anticipated pricing variance in 2013 upon which our guidance is predicated has already been implemented or announced. The Asia, EEMA, and Latin America and Canada regions are forecast to generate strong OCI growth again this year, while we expect to be able to maintain our current high level of profitability in the European Union region, excluding currency.Our brands are performing very well with 8 of our top 10 brands increasing volume in 2012, excluding the Japan hurdle. Arguably, our greatest achievement in 2012 was the continued growth of Marlboro with its architecture firmly in place complemented by the new campaign and the continued rollout of an array of consumer relevant line extensions across the Flavor, Gold, and Fresh lines, Marlboro continued to expand its share on a global basis to reach 9.3%, excluding China and the U.S.For the first time, since the 2008 spin Marlboro grew share in all four regions underscoring its enhanced brand equity, continued relevance, and renewed vitality. Above premium price, Parliament achieved double-digit volume growth last year to reach a total of 43.4 billion units. This excellent result was driven by its superb performance in Turkey, in Russia, and across Eastern Europe as well as in Middle East.","Parliament has a refined luxury image and has benefited from packaging upgrade and the launch of the industry\u2019s first ever re recessed filter capsule product in Korea. We\u2019re also very pleased with the renewed strength of L&M in 2012. Volume grew by 4% to 93.7 billion units.This growth was driven by increased availability in Egypt. The long awaited turn around in Russia, a strong performance across the bakkens, shared gains in Thailand and a higher volume in Turkey. In the European Union region, L&M continued to grow share in this five most important markets, namely Slovakia, Poland, Belgium, Germany and  (inaudible). However this was offset by a shared decline in markets in the Southern part of the Europe largely compensated by share gains on Chesterfields. On a regional basis, L&M share was stable at 6.6% last year.Our leading position and our strong share growth momentum in Indonesia give us a unique position in the global tobacco industry. Based on an expanded Nielsen coverage, we have updated our market data on Indonesia. In 2012 we estimate that the total cigarette industry volume increased by 8.2% to 303 billion units driven by favorable demographics and a strong economy. We expect continued strong industry volume growth in a range of 5% to 6% going forward.Our volume search by 17.5% last year and we expanded our market share from 32.8% to 35.6% a gain of 2.8 share points. Our strong premium skewed portfolio led by some Sampoerna A and our superior national distribution was reinforced by favorable retail price points.I would also like to highlight our strong performance in two email markets, our volume in Russia increased by 3.8% last year while total industry volume declined an estimated 1.3% over the same period driven by higher prices. In 2012, we gained 0.5 percentage share points, thanks to the strength of our broadly based portfolio and investments in marketing and sales. The key drivers of our market share growth were above premium parliaments, mid-priced L&M and low price Bond Street and Next. Importantly, we improved our position in the growing slimmer diameter segment.Last autumn the Russian parliament approved excised tax increases for 2013 in-line with it's previously published plans. Subsequently we registered new retail prices with increases of 6 to 7 rubles per pack across our portfolio. In Turkey, total cigarette industry volume grew by 8.8% last year to 99 billion units driven by a reduction in a listed trade, trade loading in the fourth quarter of 2012 ahead of a full seen excise tax and price increase. A weak fourth quarter 2011 growth in the adult population and the strong economic environment. Our volume increased by 12.7% last year and we expanded our market share by a further 0.9 points to 45.7%.At the same time we improved our mix behind the growth of premium parliaments and mid-priced (inaudible). In January we increased our retail prices by 1 Turkish Lira per pack and responded to the excise tax increase that was announced by the government. The new excise tax regime now includes a specific element for the very first time. In contrast the business environment in the Southern part of Europe remains very challenging as illustrated by Italy where unemployment reached 11.1% in November 2012, 1.7 above the prior year level.In 2012, Italy\u2019s cigarette industry volumes declined by 7.9% as adult smokers impacted by a reduction in purchasing power switched to lower taxed fine cut products and to illicit trade, which grew by some 40% and 80% respectively. However, during the year, the government reduced the tax differential between fine cut and cigarettes. Consequently, the growth of the fine cut category slowed to less than 2% in the fourth quarter when cigarette volume declined by a more moderate 4%.Despite this challenging environment, our brands performed strongly in Italy. Marlboro grew its cigarette market share by 0.6 points to 23.1%. The growth accelerated in the fourth quarter when its share increased 1.3 points to 23.5%. We successfully launched Philip Morris Selection in the growing international low-priced segment at the beginning of 2012. It achieved a 0.5% share for the full year and 0.8% in the fourth quarter. Finally, Chesterfield in addition to holding its own in the cigarette category obtained a 23.5% share of the fine cut category.While revenue growth remains the key to success in our business, we continue to be very focused on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted Operating Companies Income margin increased in 2012 from 44.1% to 45.2%, excluding currency. This improvement reflects not only higher pricing, but also limited cost increases, our success in surpassing our $300 million one year productivity target and our continued efforts to optimize our manufacturing footprint. This year, we are targeting a further $300 million in productivity savings to help offset expected moderate increases in lease and direct materials as well as higher clove costs. While our business continued to generate growing amounts of cash from higher earnings, our free cash flow of $8.4 billion in 2012 was down $1.1 billion or 11.6%, excluding currency. This decline was attributable to higher working capital requirements of $1.7 billion as well as a $220 million increase in capital expenditures.The working capital increase was primarily driven by Indonesia, where our business growth led to higher tobacco leaf and finished goods inventories and where we took advantage of a larger, but admittedly significantly more expensive clove crop to build stocks for future business growth. In addition, we needed to replenish our global tobacco leaf stocks following our unexpectedly large cigarette sales in Japan in 2011. The increase in capital expenditures is attributable in particular to production capacity increases in the Asia and EEMA regions.We anticipate a strong increase in our currency neutral free cash flow in 2013 though we do plan further increases in capital expenditures related notably to additional capacity in Indonesia and to the establishment of next generation products manufacturing capacity. In addition, as has been the case historically, forestalling related inventory requirements can fluctuate significantly and are difficult to forecast accurately. However in 2013, we project that our cash flow growth will exceed that of our earnings growth.As you can see on this chart since the 2008 spend, we have transformed the higher proportion of our growing net revenues into free cash flow than any of our consumer products in tobacco industry peers. In September last year, we increased our dividend by a further 10.4% bringing the cumulative increase since 2008 to 84.8%. We initiated a new three-year $18 billion share repurchase program in August of 2012. Last year, in total, we spent $6.5 billion to repurchase 74.9 million shares.We remain committed to a balanced program of returning cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and we target share repurchases of 6 billion in 2013. In conclusion, we expect to deliver strong results again in 2013? A diluted earnings per share guidance is $5.68 to $5.78, this corresponds to a 10% to 12% growth rate excluding currency, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22. This is fully in-line with our mid-to-long term currency neutral, annual EPS growth targets which we have achieved or surpassed every year of our existence as an independent public company.The excise tax and regulatory environment we believe are manageable. The pricing environment remains favorable and we have already achieved 75% of the pricing that is baked into our 2013 guidance. We forecast organic volume growth this year excluding the Philippines. We have strong growth momentum, Marlboro gained share in all four regions, parliament achieved double digit volume growth and our business in the Asia and the EMO regions is in great shape. The EU region remains fragile but we certainly do not anticipate a deterioration thus is the overall consumption trends we observed in 2012.We forecast strong free cash flow growth excluding currency this year and we remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through attracted dividends and substantial share repurchase programs.Since March 2008, we have returned the total of nearly $50 billion to our shareholders and repurchased 23.2% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spend. Thank you for your attention. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.David Adelman - Morgan StanleyLouis first a question on the guidance and fundamentally it's whether are you being conservative in your initial outlook because it's early in the year or are there some things to be mindful of particularly this year and the reason I ask is it that in the year just concluded is it 11.7% underlying local currency, EPS growth and that was despite the Japanese hurdle which you\u2019re not going up against this year.Louis CamilleriThat\u2019s correct David. No I don\u2019t see anything out there that is of concern to us, in the Philippines we have mentioned for some time and that\u2019s baked into our guidance. I have to say that Southern Europe as I mentioned in my remarks continuous to be fragile, as opposed to what others may have said we have actually have not detected a deterioration in trends. In fact if you look at fourth quarter trends they were better in every single market in the European Union with the exception of Spain and Italy whether you look at it from a total cigarette point of view or cigarette including OTP. France has been a slightly weaker because of the price increase but we have detected a significant improvement in the trend from October, November, December and even January now.So, the watch out is Southern Europe elsewhere we\u2019re in great shape I think David. I mean Asia and EEMA are growing strongly and growing in a quality manner. If I look at EEMA alone and you look at their growth, 60% of their growth came from pricing and 40% from volume mix which is quite a phenomenal achievement and if you go to Asia pricing was 70% but volume mix contributed 30%. So I would say we\u2019re in very good shape, you may call our guidance conservative I think at this time of the year we always have to express caution and we will see how the year unfolds but we certainly have momentum going forward.David Adelman - Morgan StanleyOkay. And then maybe if I could one other quick question, you have obviously a major competitor domiciled in Japan and with the weakness in the yen, there is presumably some prospect that, that competitor could elect to be a little more price aggressive than otherwise would be the case? Is there any evidence of that\u2019s materializing to any extent to this point?Louis CamilleriNo, evidence whatsoever David. In fact, I was very encouraged that they increased their earning guidance to reflect the weakness of the yen. So, that\u2019s a positive sign. And I would say that in terms of pricing, things are looking pretty good.David Adelman - Morgan StanleyOkay, great. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.Judy Hong - Goldman SachsThanks. Good afternoon everyone.Louis CamilleriGood afternoon Judy.Judy Hong - Goldman SachsLouis, just on your volume for 2013, so if I understood you correctly, you said Philippines down 20%, 25%, so that\u2019s probably a negative 2, 2.5 points of an impact. If we assume that the underlying volume trend ex-Philippines kind of stay what we saw in 2012, up 2% ex-Japan, is the kind of all-in volume outlook for 2013 close to flattish?Louis CamilleriAs I said in my remarks, we see organic volume growth of about 1% this year excluding the Philippines, if you include the Philippines, your calculation was right as to the impact of the Philippines was down about 1.5%. We have had significant price increases in a number of markets. Russia has been a significant price increase. It\u2019s being implemented in the market as we speak. So, it\u2019s hard to gorge at this point what will happen in terms of volume. We don\u2019t anticipate a dramatic deterioration at all, but it remains a watch-out. Southern Europe as I said we believe that the trends are likely to remain the same as last year. There could be upside Judy, but it\u2019s a bit early to call that, we will see as the year unfolds and certainly when Jacek takes you through the April \u2013 in April through the first quarter, we should have a much better read of Europe. So, that\u2019s where we stand, Judy.Judy Hong - Goldman SachsOkay. And then Louis if I just kind of take a step back and I look at your portfolio from a geographic exposure perspective, you have got now about 55% of the profit coming from sort of the non-OECDs and excluding Japan and Europe and those markets are growing profit double-digits. So, when I think about your long-term growth algorithm, 6% to 8%, if you can maintain that 55% of your business growing at a double-digit, you probably only need flattish kind of growth in Europe and in Japan from an operating profit perspective. So, I guess my question is kind of is there upside to that Europe, Japan profit growth number going forward or is there downside to kind of that double-digit growth from a profitability perspective on these non-OECD markets?Louis CamilleriNo, I think your analysis is very accurate, Judy. We have always said that we feel that European Union one day will come back, but we need to see some meaningful assets to get the employment rates back up. And the economies remain fragile and there is still quite a lot of restructuring to do, but we are somewhat optimistic that government seemed to be now weary of the austerity push and are trying to focus a bit more on employment. So, yes, if the EU were to improve that would obviously increase our growth capacity.As to Japan, I would say one of the highlights for me anyway of Japan in 2012 was that the market was relatively stable, relative to the secular decline trend that we had witnessed previously. So, we enter the year with a pretty strong market. Our share as you noticed increased sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter, so we hit 27.7% which admittedly was lower than our exit share in 2011 but if I look at our January share in Japan it was 28.3%, so Japan volume I think has, is potentially stronger than it has been in the past but clearly income will come from pricing and in terms of pricing we\u2019re a follower in Japan. We try to lead once and clearly we need to follow.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.Bonnie Herzog - Wells FargoMy first question is on net price realization. You mentioned you know key growth driver this year is your price realization, it looks like you generated maybe around 4.5% net price realization on an organic basis last year which is very positive but I think down from historical net price utilization of maybe mid-to-high single digits. So I guess I would like to understand what gives you the confidence that you can reaccelerate price realization this year you know given the tough macroeconomic environment and I think you mentioned you have already put 75% of your pricing actions in the market. So I\u2019m just trying to understand the probability of these actions sticking and also love to hear from you Louis if this is typical that you have typically started a year with this much pricing action already in place.Louis CamilleriI believe you know if I look at the last three years we have sort of hovered around 60% to 70%, this is 75% so we feel we\u2019re in a pretty good shape and yeah pricing has been the driver and we will continue to be the driver of our growth. There is not much I can add to that Bonnie as you know pricing is always a very delicate subject.Bonnie Herzog - Wells FargoThat\u2019s fair but I guess that was helpful to understand that you have put more in place early on in this year than you have typically have, so that\u2019s helpful. I guess I also have a question on Asian and specifically Indonesia very impressive growth as you highlighted for us. So, you know as I look back at some of my modeling work you know it looks like your profits in Indonesia can actually soon surpass the profits you generate in Japan. So my first question is you know what\u2019s a realistic growth forecast for this market in Indonesia and then could you maybe touch on potential opportunities you have in Thailand, Vietnam and maybe other key markets in Asia that could be a nice surprise for us over the next few years.Louis CamilleriWell it clearly would be a lofty ambition for us to get Indonesia upto Japan in the very near future, I think one day yes that is very possible. You know it also relates to Judies question earlier, you know the market in Indonesia has been growing at more than 8% back in 2011 and 2012. This year we forecast a growth of 5% to 6%. I think that also translates into higher pricing because cloth cost have increased significantly and they have increased for every player in the industry. We see our variable costs increasing by about 3.5% going forward and half of that, half the increase to total company relates to cloth cost so that will require pricing in Indonesia which may somewhat temporarily slow down the growth we have seen in the past couple of years. Having said that we continue to feel optimistic that we will continue to gain share, essentially all our brands gain share in 2012 so we have momentum.So yes Indonesia is a jewel. As to the rest of Asia, I think we\u2019re performing very strongly in various markets and of course China is still out there one day and the market still continues to grow.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.Vivien Azer \u2013 CitiMy first question has to do with the EU and then I fully appreciate that you are not expecting a deterioration and things seemingly are so bad already that seems fair enough on just from a macro perspective, but what gives you confidence that you won\u2019t see an acceleration in illicit trade as the consumer remains cash trapped?Louis CamilleriBecause if we look at the pricing environment in the EU, we don\u2019t see a major acceleration, there has been equalization on fine cut. So, people \u2013 tax equalization on fine cut in number of places, so people are moving back to cigarettes as I showed in Italy in my remarks. Illicit trade continues to be a concern. Our census last year it was about 11.1% of consumption relative to 10.4% in the previous year. So, it\u2019s grown. And our hope is that governments and we are doing a lot of work as you know we signed an agreement with the INTERPOL. There is work on tracking and tracing to ensure that we can fight the illicit trade as has been done successfully in other markets and most notably last year in Turkey.Vivien Azer - CitiFair enough. That makes good sense. Switching gears to next generation products when we were in (indiscernible) in June, you mentioned that there were short-term clinical trials underway on your Phase 1 product are you able to give us an update on how those went?Louis CamilleriNot much I can say Vivien. So far all the results we have are extremely positive and the green lights are shining. So, we continue, but there is still a lot of work to be done on risk assessment as well as clearly on the regulatory front. In the meantime as I alluded to in my remarks, we will be starting investments in setting up manufacturing capacity to those products, so that tells you that we continue to very firmly believe in that.Vivien Azer - CitiFair enough. And my last question have to do with plain packaging, I know Australia is a very small market for you, but could you give us your read on how plain packaging has affected that market?Louis CamilleriWell, as you know, it was implemented effective December 1, there was a bit of turbulence in the market. Retailers in particular found it very difficult to adapt. Some of our competitors were slightly out of stock. So, our share was actually quite strong in December, but all the daily sales we see and the research we\u2019ve done there appears to be no change whatsoever in terms of sales levels, incidence, or brand choice. Having said that, it is still very, very early days. And we\u2019ll see what happens over a long-term period. And I think other governments will watch the Australian example very carefully. And my sense is that wisdom would dictate that people would look at the Australian example before they take on this policy measure, which we believe will do nothing to help public health.Vivien Azer - CitiThat\u2019s great. Thank you very much.Louis CamilleriYou\u2019re welcome.OperatorYour next question comes from the line Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg Bank.Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg BankGood afternoon, Louis.Louis CamilleriGood afternoon Erik.Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg BankIf we could follow-up on the plain packaging issue in particular with respect to the status of the WTO and BIT challenges. And then I was curious with respect to the tobacco products directive, what implications in its current form does that have for Philip Morris\u2019 NGP business? Thanks.Louis CamilleriWell, in terms of the BIT claim that is proceeding essentially according to schedule. We still feel that the merits of our case is very strong, but it will be a two-year process Erik. There is not much more than I can say on that. The arbitration panel has been formed. The procedural elements have been set up. And now there is a whole schedule of our claim being filed and then the responses from the government and then hearing et cetera but as I said it will be a two year process. On the WTO aspect that claim is proceeding. The very interesting thing is that there are some 31 countries that have asked for observer status including such major countries as China and I\u2019m told that that is probably the highest ever level of countries that have asked for observer status which shows the interest there is on this issue in terms of plain packaging and the violation of trademark rights.With regard to the European TPD on NGP is still early days Erik, as you know they are either tobacco products or pharmaceutical products. So it doesn\u2019t in any way curtail the ability of the company to do NGPs. But frankly the thresholds that are within the proposal I think are subject to considerable debate and my sense is that before that proposal is put to bed things are likely to change because essentially the thresholds were based on existing nicotine replacement therapies as opposed to new products.Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg BankAnd then with respect to Russia, I mean that appears to be quite a robust market in terms of up trading, you know favoring Parliament in Marlboro but I was wondering how should we think about the evolution of the market through the remainder of 2013 with respect to lower price. Are we seeing the market separate into premier oriented and then discount or how is that developing from a Philip Morris point of view? Thank you.Louis CamilleriSo the low segment Erik continues to decline, I think over the last couple of years it has declined by 10 share points and that\u2019s moving up to what we call value made and premium more recently premium as sort of been flattish. As you know there has been quite a significant price increase as I mentioned earlier prices are actually coming into effect in the market as we speak. The percentage gap between low value and premium actually is going to narrow and empirical evidence would suggest from various other markets that when the percentage gap comes down or narrows that generally actually helps up trading. So we don\u2019t really anticipate any change in the trend and we certainly anticipate continued shared growth with Parliament. With regard to Marlboro as you know we have put in a number of new products to enhance the brand equity of the brands, we said it would take quite a long time. Share has been pretty well flat over the last four months which is already an improvement over the erosion the brand has suffered in the past, the consumer research we have is clearly very positive virtually on all fronts but before that translates into share growth I think it will take some time. In the mean time we will continue to work that brand because we honestly believe that it does have considerable untapped potential in this very significant market.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.Jon Leinster \u2013 UBSJust going back to the European, with the increase and the unemployment and the rates declined that we have seen in volumes, do you think there has been a change in pricing last 50 and would that change again if illicit trade and (inaudible) was brought under control?Louis CamilleriI don\u2019t think there has been a significant change in price elasticity per say Jonathan, I think it's really purchasing power has declined quite considerably so people are looking for cheaper alternatives. Governments have noticed that and they are trying to both equalize the tax burden on fine cut and cigarettes to protect their revenues and also there is clearly a renewed effort to try to fight contraband and especially the advent of illicit rights and counterfeit. It\u2019s actually quite ironic that the European Union Tobacco Products Directive, when tobacco product represents some 11% of consumption in Europe, they want to ban slims and menthol that are about 10% of consumption. That\u2019s the size of the French market or the Spanish market, in fact slightly higher. So, there is a lot to be done on this TBD, because clearly illicit trade everybody has to get together to fight it.Jon Leinster - UBSOkay. Certainly, just regarding the exports are going to Japan, can you just remind us what your hedging policy is on the transaction event?Louis CamilleriWell, we try to hedge it occasionally. And this year, we have hedged 50% of our exposure. We did it several months ago, so obviously at attractive rates relative to the spot rate. Nevertheless, we still have 50% exposure on the remaining balance, but I am glad we at least have hedged 50%.Jon Leinster - UBSBut that\u2019s just a transactional exposure, certainly all the translational you mean?Louis CamilleriYes, we know about it, we know about hedge transaction.Jon Leinster - UBSCorrect. And lastly, the trade load in the fourth quarter, I think you mentioned out there just sort of 60 basis points. So, I mean roughly speaking that\u2019s sort of $45 million to $50 million in sales kind of (still confident) into profits?Louis CamilleriYeah.Jon Leinster - UBSYeah, okay, thanks very much.Louis CamilleriIt varies by the market, but that it\u2019s principally in the EEMA markets.Jon Leinster - UBSGreat, thank you very much.Louis CamilleriThank you.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.Chris Growe - Stifel NicolausHi. Good afternoon Louis.Louis CamilleriChris, good afternoon.Chris Growe - Stifel NicolausHi, I just had two questions for you. The first one a bit of a follow-on there to Jonathan\u2019s question regarding the inventory overall helped your volume in the quarter, but I think overall would it have been a drag on your EU volume in the quarter and could you quantify that effect in rough terms?Louis CamilleriIn EU, it was essentially neutral.Chris Growe - Stifel NicolausOkay.Louis CamilleriThe one thing that affected us was more in terms of share, because there was a lot of loading in Germany by some of our competitors. It was significant to give you a sense of the significance. Our January share in \u2013 our January share in Germany was slightly above 41%.Chris Growe - Stifel NicolausOkay. Okay, and then I have a follow-up question for you also about the EU and it\u2019s just kind of a bigger picture question if you will. In the current environment that we are in where you have volumes going down at a more aggressive rate, you have had some pretty good price realizations still to help to offset that. I guess I am just curious maybe it\u2019s just from a fixed cost standpoint or what you need to do to help keep profitability flat or even growing that market, do you need to do some sort of restructuring or asset work to try and keep that profit growth in that flat to up region if we are in this environment that we are in today?Louis CamilleriWell, first Chris, we don\u2019t see a deterioration in the volume trends. And your question was premised on a sort of more aggressive down trend, which we really don\u2019t see. And as I mentioned to Judy earlier, there maybe upside, but it\u2019s a bit early to call. With regard to cost structure, we have always been very careful to ensure that we are as cost efficient as possible. Our European factories supply a number of markets. So, they are running at pretty good capacities. We have invested considerable amount of money in marketing and sales forces in Europe to gain share and we continued to gain share. If you recall and I think we highlighted this in our earnings release Marlboro was up in the European Union and its share actually accelerated in the fourth quarter but it was up for the first time since 2002. So we\u2019re very encouraged by that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Chris Ferrara - Bank of America Merrill LynchSo just back to Japan, can you talk a little bit about I guess the Cadence of new products flow, because to your point market share increased sequentially while it's still down year-over-year. I guess we have fit a flattening out point on share do you think and how much does it relate to your new product flow relative to the competition in the market?Louis CamilleriWell definitely product innovation is key to gaining share in Japan, we think we have a pretty good program in place for 2013. Our launch is in 2012 we\u2019re pretty successful, so we actually believe we can continue to gain share in Japan, you know we said that the exit share was the base on which to go forward you know that was probably an ambitious target because you know JT probably hadn\u2019t gone back to it's normal share but certainly the January trend looks very favorable and given the product innovation we have going forward we see opportunity, as you know very well JT is embarking on a very ambitious program to move mile certainly to (inaudible) and we will see whether there maybe opportunities in there.Chris Ferrara - Bank of America Merrill LynchGreat and I guess just as a follow-up on the market, it's been a while I think for your point since you\u2019ve seen it normalized volume number, I guess how would you characterize the sustainable market volume rate of decline in Japan at this point?Louis CamilleriWell you know last year if you our best estimate taking care of inventories et cetera while there was an underline decline of about 1%. And without any pricing we wouldn\u2019t see why that would be any difference in that coming forward into 2013 which is clearly considerable improvement over the past.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSAJust a question on your repurchase guidance, I realize it's early and it could certainly fluctuate but with currency being such a headwind last year it's a little surprising that your guidance would be less than you did already, was there some other, was there a factor in 2012 that would have helped to make that bigger or what should we expect for this year? Is it just a conservative starting number or how do you think about how those two compare?Louis CamilleriWell I don\u2019t think I would call it $6 billion conservative but essentially we have premier program that\u2019s $18 billion that makes it $6 billion a year. If we went to $6.5 last year it was a one point, we felt it stock price was clearly very undervalued, I think possibly because of some sort of regulatory concerns or profit taking, so we took the opportunity to buy more shares what we thought was a very attractive price. It's I think a very generous target, and we hope that we will be able to do the 6 billion this year.Michael Lavery - CLSAOkay that\u2019s fair, and then just looking at your business in Korea, it looks like your 4Q share was a little less than your full year share but I know there is an uneven pacing there, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory there and what the competitive dynamics look like?Louis CamilleriWell it's slightly distorted because we took a price increase back in February if you recall, so clearly January, February we had a high share and we suffered after the price increase. However our share has essentially been flat at about for the last I would say seven months. So, in terms of share, we are in relatively good shape in Korea. What needs to happen in Korea is a reform of excise taxes and there are various proposals in legislature. As you know, there is a new government in place. And hopefully with taxes that hopefully will be adjusted for inflation every year that will give more flexibility in terms of pricing. And clearly we hope that KT&G will move prices one day.Michael Lavery - CLSAAnd then I realized obviously the politics are a little bit unpredictable, I mean in the meantime, do you have anything else that could bridge the gap like innovation pipeline or something else that could help share besides more narrow share gaps, price gaps?Louis CamilleriYes, most definitely, we have a program in place to launch some pretty exciting new products as we did last year. So, our ambition is to gain share. Our profitability in Korea increased significantly last year, because of our price increase. And I think our brand equity remains very strong in particular though with Parliament. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the Parliament capsule product we think has a lot of promise.Michael Lavery - CLSAOkay, that\u2019s helpful. And then in Indonesia, you share gains last year obviously were pretty significant, but you have several years where that\u2019s been the case? And I love to get a sense for what a sustainable trajectory looks like? Is the source of share primarily the 20% to 25% of the category that\u2019s small fragmented players, so that you have got a sort of a deep pool from what you can continue to draw or what are some of the dynamics there, what\u2019s the source that you are sharing and what can it look like in the next few years?Louis CamilleriWell, that\u2019s certainly one of the sources, especially as the government continues to narrow the various tax tiers in the tax metrics, but I would say that our major competitive advantage is the investments we have made in our distribution infrastructure and field forces and in terms of our brand equities. So, we feel very good about our share performance in the past and our future prospects for share growth. I would also say that because of the strength of the economy, there is clearly an up-trading trend and our share in the upper price segment is significantly higher than our total share of the market. So, we have then grown share growth built-in as those trends continue. And we see no reason why they should not continue. As you are probably aware, they dramatically increased minimum wage rates in Indonesia recently. So, clearly that will benefit the up-trading trend.Michael Lavery - CLSAThat\u2019s helpful. And then just one last question on the next generation products, I know an endorsement or approval or whatever the proper term is from the FDA would be sort of a passport to just about any market, but given the unpredictability of this administration in particular or just they don\u2019t seem to be in any rush to support tobacco companies, so what are the options without that how big of a hurdle is it to have that, and are you able to get similar approvals in markets that you would want to launch in that wouldn\u2019t necessarily need anything from the FDA to let you get a green light there?Louis CamilleriWell, clearly the FDA would be very helpful and we have engaged with the FDA, but it is not a pre-condition to launching these products elsewhere. We are in discussions with regulators in various jurisdictions. So, that is an ongoing effort that\u2019s parallel to the one that\u2019s going on with the FDA. FDA support will clearly be very helpful, but as I said it\u2019s not a pre-condition.Michael Lavery - CLSAThank you very much.Louis CamilleriYou\u2019re welcome.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.Thilo Wrede - JefferiesGood afternoon.Louis CamilleriHi, Thilo.Thilo Wrede - JefferiesTwo quick questions for you. First one in the Philippines, what\u2019s your level of confidence for this 20% to 25% volume impact, if I remember correctly the volume impact in Japan was supposed to be somewhat turn out to be much less dramatic, so how confident are you that this will happen in the Philippines?Nick Rolli","Well you know I would hope it would follow the Japanese example I think, the Philippines is doing well economically, worker remittance is continued to increase. So the macros look quite favorable, nevertheless it's a significant price increase. My concern Thilo is really the advent of contraband and as you know there is a lot of contraband product in other categories in the Philippines and also potentially tax avoidance by some of the other players which we have seen in the past. So, hopefully the government can plan down on that, they have said that they would have institute of very strict product tracking and tracing systems at the manufacturing end. Listen today as I said in my remarks it's a hard one to call, it could do better and if so I would be the first to be delighted.Thilo Wrede - JefferiesFair enough. And then Louis when you look out for the year and you look at the macro headwinds and so on Europe if you look at the noise from plain packaging, you look at tax increases in the Philippines, you look at illicit trade in Europe and so on. Is this the most challenging environment that you operate in be it from a two operational perspective or just from a noise perspective since this spin off from Altria?Louis CamilleriI\u2019m not sure that it's the worst. We have lived it with it for a little while, I would say that you know the strength of this company is irrespective of what\u2019s thrown at us we have various points of leverage to meet our ambitions and that\u2019s what makes this company great.Thilo Wrede - JefferiesAnd so you\u2019re not concerned about all that noises out there.Louis CamilleriOf course I\u2019m confirmed about it but I think we can overcome it and as you say a lot of it is noise as opposed to real action.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori with Credit Suisse.Rogerio Fujimori - Credit SuisseI have one question about consumer up trading in emerging markets. Among your top non-OCD markets which non-OCD markets which ones are standing out in terms of positive variance in the premier share of the market. I recall Mexican, Indonesia stood out in the first half, first as if they remain the bright spot in Q4, are there any other markets that now are standing out? Thank you.Louis CamilleriYou know if I look across the world essentially they all are growing up in terms of emerging markets. Clearly the ones you mentioned, Turkey, Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil pretty well everywhere at the moment. Philippines was somewhat distorted because there was trade loading by the competitors but we see if I look at Vietnam, Malaysia, you name it there is pretty well up trading across the board.Rogerio Fujimori - Credit SuisseAnd just one question about France, have you not see any sequential deterioration in volume trends. It looks like the total market was down 7% in Q4, any color would be appreciated. Thank you.Louis CamilleriActually no in France you\u2019re right, Q4 was down but it improved as the quarter essentially unfolded and in fact if I look at January total volumes were down 3.4% so that\u2019s clearly an improvement over the fourth quarter which was distorted by the October price increase.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of David Hayes with Nomura.David Hayes \u2013 NomuraJust in terms of the brands in pool and the infrastructure investment that you talk about in terms of the Be Marlboro success in Europe and then in Russia as well. How should we think about that in terms of that continuing into 2013? Was there a ramp up in \u201812 and that comes off a little bit or do we see another step change again in 2013? And the second question from me was just going back to Japan obviously no tax rise, JT seemed to allude to the fact they would try to get a price rise maybe still I just wonder whether you want to crack any comment about whether you think the environment \u2013 the regulatory environment there would allow for that and whether your guidance would assume any price rise in Japan or whether that would be upside to what you have outlined today? Thanks very much.Louis CamilleriYou are welcome David. The first question yes, there will continue to be a ramp up that was in \u201812 and there is actually going to be what we forecast a considerable ramp up in 2013 of the Be Marlboro campaign and all the consumer engagement try to engage programs that we have as they are slowly rolled out across the world. In terms of JT, the partial privatization, I think nobody is quite aware of the timing and we\u2019ll see when that happens. It may trigger JT\u2019s desire to increase prices or enhance their ability to do so. If JT were to increase prices that will be terrific news and yes, there would be an upside.David Hayes - NomuraOkay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.Louis CamilleriYou\u2019re welcome.OperatorOur final question comes from the Ann Gurkin with Davenport.Ann Gurkin - DavenportHello everyone.Louis CamilleriHi Ann, the best for last.Ann Gurkin - DavenportHi. I had a question regarding Russia and if Russia decides to ban smoking in public places, how do you incorporate that into your outlook, particularly in the second half for calendar \u201813?Louis CamilleriWe don\u2019t anticipate a major impact and it\u2019s not at all sure there would be. There is a reading I think for February 12 of the tobacco control law and we will see what happens there, but we don\u2019t anticipate any major shift in trend there.Ann Gurkin - DavenportOkay, great. And then I always like to ask about leaf cost and listening to your comments about expecting moderate increase in leaf prices in \u201813, is that trend in pricing in line with your expectations following your vertical integration move, is that falling within that kind of band of pricing expectations or do you think you need to make changes to vertical integration?Louis CamilleriNo, it\u2019s fully in line with our expectations. And there is not much I can add to that. I think the one that I highlighted that will be a cost driver is the clove cost. That\u2019s the main driver. Leaf is certainly increasing at manageable levels and in line with our expectations.Ann Gurkin - DavenportThat is great. Thank you so much.Louis CamilleriThank you very much, Ann.OperatorThank you. That was our final question. I\u2019d now like to turn the floor back over to Nick for any closing comments.Nick RolliWell, thank you very much for joining us. That does conclude our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR team. We are currently in New York today and tomorrow. And just as a reminder, our next presentation will be at the Consumer Analyst Group of New York or CAGNY Conference in Boca Raton, Florida on Wednesday, February 20 and that presentation will also be webcast. So, thank you again and have a great day.OperatorThank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"17196":["Philip Morris International Inc.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the first quarter of 2013 and comparing them to the same periods in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes or to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes.","Operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the back of this presentation which is also posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We had a relatively sound start to the year when one considers the difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter last year. Our business fundamentals continue to be solid and we have good momentum in key markets and segments.","In February, we provided a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.68 to $5.78. We see no reason to change our guidance today due to business factors. However, we have witnessed increased currency volatility and in particular a weakening of the Euro and the Yen due to the economic crisis in Europe and changes in economic policy in Japan. Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates, we now forecast a full-year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.19 per share rather than the $0.06 cents included in our previous guidance.","Our revised reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is therefore $5.55 to $5.65, compared to $5.17 in 2012. This reflects a growth rate excluding currency, of approximately 10% to 12%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012. This is matching the growth rate that we announced in February. This is fully in line with our mid to long-term currency neutral annual growth target highlighting the continued strength of our underlying business model and the robustness of our growth algorithm.","Let me now take you through our first-quarter results and provide you with our outlook for some of our key markets.","Organic volume in the first quarter was down by 2.1%, excluding the Philippines. This reflects three main factors. First, we had a difficult comparison with a very strong first quarter last year when organic volume grew by 5.3% year-on-year. This was helped by the leap-year.","Second, there was a reversal of trade inventory build-ups that took place in several markets during the fourth quarter of 2012 ahead of expected tax and price increases, notably impacted Turkey. Third, cigarette markets in the EU region continue to be influenced by the economic crisis and high unemployment levels.","I would nevertheless like to highlight the fact that, excluding the Philippines, we achieved organic volume growth this quarter in the Asia and EEMA regions, and continue to expect organic volume growth on a global basis for the full-year of 2013.","The decline in our volume and the overall difficult comparisons with the prior year impacted our financial results in the first quarter of this year. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were up by 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively, excluding currency and acquisitions. Despite this, our adjusted diluted EPS performance excluding currency was solid with growth of 8.8%.","Pricing continues to be the key driver of our income performance. Our pricing variance in the first quarter reached $531 million, significantly higher than that achieved during the same quarter last year","Since October, we have notably increased prices in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Spain, Turkey, Ukraine, and the U.K. In addition, last week we announced new prices in Germany.","The favorable pricing environment is backed by the strength of our brand portfolio and supported by an excise tax environment, which with the exception of the Philippines, has been rational and characterized by structural improvements. Our market share growth momentum continued in the first quarter with gains in three of our four regions and the Asia region essentially stable, excluding the Philippines.","Marlboro volume, excluding the Philippines, was down by 2.2% in the first quarter, driven by cigarette industry volume declines in the EU. Nevertheless, Marlboro market share increased or was essentially stable in all four regions, excluding the Philippines. Marlboro achieved notable share gains of 0.7 and 0.8 points respectively in the EU and the Latin America and Canada regions during the quarter.","Our above-premium Parliament continues to show great momentum with a volume increase in the quarter of 5.4%, this despite the trade inventory reversal in Turkey. Parliament continued to gain share in its key markets of Kazakhstan, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine, while making further inroads in the Middle East.","L&M volume increased by 4.3% in the first quarter of this year, driven by its positive momentum in the EEMA Region and a resilient share performance in the EU Region. Three markets stand out, namely Egypt, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, and I would be also pleased by L&M\u2019s renewed growth in Russia.","Let me now review what is happening in key geographies. Let's start with the EU. The situation in the EU has attracted considerable attention given the region\u2019s high level of profitability and the depth and duration of the economic crisis. Consumer products companies have been suffering as average unemployment levels reached double digits and continue to grow.","The key driver of our 10.1% decline in cigarette volume in the EU Region during the first quarter was the decrease in industry volume of 10.5%, with a notably steep decline in southern European markets. This decline was exacerbated by unfavorable trade inventory movements and fewer selling days. Let me also remind you that the first quarter was the strongest for cigarette industry volume in the region last year.","While overall tobacco consumption levels remain fairly stable, there continues to be down-trading to cheaper fine cut proposition and to illicit trade. Fine cut industry volume increased by 2.1% in the first quarter, while the latest EU-wide study indicates that the level of illicit trade has climbed to 11.1% from 10.4% a year earlier.","Taking the distortions of the first quarter into consideration and based on our analysis of current expectations for the remaining three quarters, we continue to forecast that cigarette industry volume for the full-year 2013 in the EU Region should decline broadly in line with that of last year.","We are encouraged by our market share gains in the EU Region. Our share was up by 0.7 points to 38.1%, though I should mention that this was partially flattered by the impact of competitive trade inventory movement.","We gained share in our five most important EU cigarette markets, namely Italy, Poland, France, Germany and Spain. We also gained share in some of the smaller markets, such as Finland, the Netherlands, and Hungary, while market share declined notably in Greece, the Baltics, Denmark, and Portugal.","Our four key brands continued to perform well highlighting our strong business fundamentals. However, our volume was hampered by the prevailing very weak economic conditions.","Marlboro\u2019s regional share increased in the first quarter by 0.7 points to 18.7% as the brand performed well in its five largest markets. L&M\u2019s share was stable at 6.6%. Chesterfield\u2019s share was up by 0.2 points to 3.7%, driven by markets such as Austria, Portugal, and Spain, as well as geographic expansion. Finally, the Philip Morris brand gained 0.3 points to reach 1.9%, thanks to its continued growth momentum in France and the success of Philip Morris Selection in Italy.","While the overall growth of the fine cut category slowed down in the first quarter, we again outperformed the competition with an in-market sales volume increase of 7.6%. We are continuing to successfully roll out fine cut variants of our leading cigarette brands, Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield, into new markets. As a result, we increased our category share by 0.7 points to 14.1% and captured 48% of the additional industry volume.","Let me now focus on two of the most important markets in the EU Region, namely Italy and Germany. The economic downturn in Italy has been severe with a decrease in real GDP of 2% last year and an increase in unemployment from 10.1% in February 2012 to 11.6% a year later. This has resulted in a decline in consumer purchasing power, which, we believe, was the main driver of the 9.5% decrease in cigarette industry volume in the first quarter of this year.","The second important factor has been an increase in illicit trade, the incidence of which doubled year-on-year. The fine cut category, meanwhile, no longer grew following the reduction in the excise tax and price differential with cigarettes that took place in the middle of last year.","We believe that the rate of decline of cigarette industry volume in Italy should moderate during the remainder of the year. However, this is contingent upon the elimination of the previously planned July VAT increase.","The underlying fundamentals of our business in Italy remain strong. Our cigarette market share grew by 0.6 points in the quarter to 53.2%, as the continued momentum of Marlboro and the success of Philip Morris Selection in the international low-price segment more than offset the decline of Merit and Diana. We are also continuing to gain share in the fine cut category, with an increase of 3.3 points in the first quarter to 30.5%, thanks notably to the successful recent launch of Marlboro fine cut.","German market was distorted in the first quarter by the leap year effect, trade inventory movements, and an increase in border sales. While cigarette industry volume was 6.6% lower in the quarter, we estimate that the underlying decline was a more moderate 2.8%. During this period, fine cut industry volume increased by 1.2%. The German economy continues to be resilient with low unemployment, and this has translated into more robust overall tobacco market trends including a recovery in the premium cigarette segment.","Our business is in a good shape with our cigarette market share slightly higher at 36.1%. Marlboro grew by 1.5 points in the quarter to 22.3% and achieved its highest cigarette share since the fourth quarter of 2009. This confirms the positive response to our new Marlboro initiatives.","While L&M\u2019s cigarette share declined by 0.7 points to 10.5%, this reflected timing as the brand\u2019s share is sequentially stable. Importantly, we have consolidated our leading position among Young Adult Smokers, with a 20% share for L&M and a 17% share for Marlboro.","Last week, we announced to the trade an increase in our cigarette retail prices of essentially \u20ac0.20 per 19 cigarettes across our total portfolio. This should come into effect at retail in May.","I will now turn to Asia, where we are continuing to strengthen our business. Our organic volume grew by 2.8%, excluding the Philippines during the first quarter. Indonesia was a key contributor.","Our cigarette volume increased by 4.9% in Indonesia during the first quarter of 2013. We again achieved a strong share performance with a gain of 1.4 points to 36.3%. As anticipated, the rate of growth has moderated as certain brands are being impacted by the crossing of key price thresholds in line with our strategy of regular price increases. Our share gains were driven by the continued strong performance of premium Sampoerna A, which was up by 0.8 points, and by mid-price U Mild, which was up by 1.2 points. Marlboro meanwhile expanded its share of the white non-kretek segment by 4 points to 75%.","Industry volume was up only slightly during the quarter, after a 13.9% surge in the same period last year. For the full year, we are forecasting a growth rate of around 5% to 6%, in line with the current 12-month moving average.","The resilience of the Indonesian economy continued improvements in consumer purchasing power and the growth of the adult population underpin the continued industry volume expansion.","In Japan, cigarette industry volume decreased by 3.2% during the first quarter and we forecast an underlying decline of around 2% for the full year in line with recent trends in adult smoking incidence.","Our shipment volume increased by 6.9%, reflecting favorable distributor inventory movements. Intense competitive product and marketing activities, notably around Japan Tobacco's morphing of Mild Seven into Mevius, impacted the Lark and Philip Morris brands. As a result, PMI reached a first quarter market share of 27.5%, 0.2 points below that of the last quarter of 2012. ","Marlboro meanwhile maintained its share. We believe that the recent launch of Lark Ice Mint 5mg and 1mg, a natural mint 100mm product, and the planned launch in May of Marlboro W-Burst 5, a double capsule menthol innovation, should enable us to resume a more positive share trend.","In the Philippines, the disproportionate tax increase that took place in January has, as expected, caused significant market disruption. In January, we increased our recommended retail prices of key brands by 60% to 70%. However, the price of individual cigarettes, set by the trade, which account for about 70% of total retail sales, increased by a larger amount in numerous outlets.","In the first quarter, our volume declined by 42.5% reflecting the consumer reaction to the higher prices, the prior-year trade inventory build-up and the impact of the new prices on the trade\u2019s working capital requirements. Cigarette industry shipments are estimated, based on Bureau of Internal Revenue data, to have been down by 39%.","However, Nielsen consumer off-take and our market research data indicate that cigarette consumption was down significantly less. The difference reflects the aforementioned trade inventory movements and in particular a surge in illicit trade.","In March, we saw a sequential improvement in volume and provided the government is successful in its efforts to improve excise tax administration, we still believe that industry volume should decline by about 20% to 25% for the full-year 2013. We expect some share erosion due to aggressive competitor pricing at the bottom end of the market.","Let me now turn to the EEMA Region, where we achieved a 1.4% volume growth in the first quarter of the year. This strong result was driven by share gains in Eastern Europe, the Middle East and North, Africa and favorable distributor inventory movements in Russia, partly offset by the anticipated reversal of the December trade inventory build-up in Turkey.","In Russia, cigarette industry volume declined by about 5.5%. This was due to recent tax-driven price increases of RUB 6 to RUB 7 a pack, which corresponded to between 9% for Parliament to 22% increase for Optima. In line with previous years, we expect this decline to moderate once adult consumers adjust to the higher prices. We estimate that the total market will be down by around 3% on a full-year basis.","Our volume increase of 1.8% in the first quarter reflected the timing of shipments to our distributor. Our market share during the first two months of the year was stable at 26.2% with gains from above-premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street and Next offset by declines from mid-price Chesterfield and super-low price Optima.","Turkey is an example of a market where a strong underlying performance was distorted by specific dynamics in the first quarter of this year. There were significant increases in trade inventory levels in the fourth quarter of 2012 that were reversed following tax-driven price increases at the beginning of 2013.","As a result, while cigarette industry volume declined by 11.6% year-on-year, the underlying market showed a slightly positive trend thanks to lower levels of illicit trade. On a full-year basis, we forecast that underlying industry volume should be relatively stable.","Our volume was down by 17.4% in the quarter as we were disproportionately impacted by the trade inventory movements. Our market share in the first two months of the year was up slightly to 44.7% as premium Parliament and mid-price Muratti continued their growth momentum, while Lark and L&M lost ground to competitive brands that were priced lower at the bottom end of the market.","In conclusion, we expect to deliver strong results again in a very challenging year. We remain confident that, despite another difficult year ahead in the EU Region, we should be able to generate organic cigarette volume growth on a global basis, excluding the Philippines. We expect this year to again achieve the financial targets of our mid to long-term currency neutral annual growth algorithm.","Our new reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance, includes the latest currency rate and is $5.55 to $5.65. This reflects a full-year growth rate of approximately 10% to 12%, excluding currency, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22.","I should point out that we foresee our growth will be skewed towards the second half of the year We anticipate strong free cash flow growth, excluding currency, in 2013. We remain committed to rewarding our shareholders through attractive dividends and substantial share repurchase programs. We will continue to judiciously invest to reinforce the long-term prospects of our business.","In the first quarter, we spent another $1.5 billion in share repurchases. Since March 2008, we have returned a total of over $50 billion to our shareholders and repurchased 24% of the shares outstanding at the time of the spin.","Thank you. And, I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference. (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Thank you. So, it sounds like you are broadly reiterating industry volume projections for the year in most places like the EU and like Indonesia. Despite what was a pretty poor volume quarter, so I guess the question is, was Q1 volume worse than you had expected or was it pretty much in line with what you thought it was going to be?","Jacek Olczak","Well, taking into consideration, you remember in February we said that we had about 75% of the pricing already implemented or announced for the year, which was pretty high compared to other first quarters in the years before. I think it was rather expected that usually after the price increases, there is this initial sort of dip in the market, and then the markets are coming to some sort of recovery. So, this was not unexpected, but you also remember, I mean, in the first quarter for PMI in total, but also specifically for EU, first quarter of 2012 was a pretty strong quarter. We've been almost growing at the 6% PMI, and EU had just a decline of 1.5% in the first quarter of 2012. So, no, I don't think we had any surprise in the performance in the first quarter.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Thanks. I guess what I am trying to get to is whether -- how you feel about the 10 to 12 on a constant currency, and whether Q1 represents just a little bit more of an obstacle relative to getting to that number, but you just still had the flexibility to get there, or whether there really is no change and you still feel like you are in the same place within that guidance range of 10 to 12 that you were before?","Jacek Olczak","No. I mean, we are very confident about the guidance. As you noticed, we are revising the guidance -- the February guidance only for the currency. So, I think the business fundamentals are very strong. The brand\u2019s portfolio performance, essentially all of our main markets are pretty solid. We had some distortions in the quarter, which I have been mentioning in my remarks.","The only thing, which I would like to add is that, I mean, we clearly are looking in the second half of the year to be somehow stronger than the first half of the year. For a number of reasons, we have in our annualization of some increased spending behind mainly marketing and sales from the last year, which is going to have an impact on us , especially in the first half of the year. There are still some inventory distortions which will continue through the second quarter of this year, but all in all, I mean we feel pretty confident about the guidance.","I mean, all the risks, which we knew are there, I mean EU volumes, EU pressure on the volume, also Philippines, the initial impact are included or baked in our guidance. And as I said, I mean, we are pretty confident on a 10% to 12% growth for this year.","Chris Ferrara - Bank of America","Great. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citi Investment Research","I am curious as we think about Italy, I recognize your guidance reflects no VAT increase. Can you speak to the probability of no VAT increase occurring and conversely if you do see an increase, how would that impact potentially your guidance for EU volumes?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I will maybe start with the second part of your question. I think we are still at this stage despite the 10% decline of the reported volumes in EU for the first quarter. We still think, broadly the rate of decline for the full year will be in a range of that which we had last year, so 6.3%, if I remember correct.","The underlying volume decline in the EU Region for the first quarter, we estimate will come in the range of 8% if I eliminate some distortions  which were in the quarter. Italy is essentially the only market or the main market, which we will have on the watch list in EU as we still don\u2019t have a clarity what's going to happen with the announced VAT increase.","If we follow the politicians' announcement, no one regardless of the party they belong to, would like to have the VAT increase. However, in order for that wish to materialize, they have to form the government, and they have to change some legislation. So, we will have to watch how the situation unfolds in Italy. But I think with the exception of the VAT increase in Italy, I think that EU still can be broadly with the rate of decline that\u2019s comparable to last year.","Vivien Azer - Citi Investment Research","Fair enough. As a follow-up to that, can you comment, perhaps, on your outlook for operating income growth in the EU? I think you have said in the past, you could hold your EBIT flat but considering the significant trade down that you are seeing in the market, I wonder whether that needs to be adjusted downward at all?","Jacek Olczak","Well, it is very much dependent, again, on the total volume development in the EU. If news from Italy is positive, I think we can maintain all the profitability. If Italy talks will happen, then it depends on the pricing [attractions] (ph), that might have some impact on the profitability in the EU. But assuming my forecast, our estimate for the total EU volumes to be broadly in line of the rate of decline of the last year would hold, I think we can maintain the profitability.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","On the EU, with weaker volumes, not just for you but obviously for the competitors, are you seeing any change or an increase in competitive intensity, companies going more for share than they might have a year ago or is it fairly stable?","Jacek Olczak","No. whatsoever. I mean, we had that pricing in quite a number of markets at the very beginning of January or towards the end of the last year. So, on the pricing side, I haven\u2019t observed anything. No, I don\u2019t think there is any risk of that nature.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay, and then in the Philippines, you mentioned to get to 20% to 25% declines in volume for the year. You need the government to crackdown on the non-duty paid dynamic. But that\u2019s been a historical factor in the market. Is there any evidence that with prices up and the illicit volumes growing that the government is taking that any more seriously than it has in the past?","Jacek Olczak","I think there was that problem, historically. You are absolutely right. Historically, we had some problems with some non-duty paid domestic product. However, that thing essentially exploded since new tax kicked in and we increased the prices. As I said, if we look at the consumption trends, I mean our estimate of the consumption trend in the Philippines at the moment as we speak, so this is still relatively early after the new prices hit the market. I would argue that the consumption decline is in the lower range of 20% to 25% decline which we foresee for the market for the full-year.","The smoking incidents stays relatively flat at 50%, actually flat at 50%. As we do observe  some decline in the daily consumption, you know the daily consumption market is very much driven by stick purchases, about 70% of the volume goes on the stick purchase, and we see the daily consumption drop from 13 to 12 sticks per day.","So, you add these numbers together, you are actually in the lower range of 20% to 25% decline. We see our shipments volume and the industry volumes as estimated by the Bureau of Internal Revenues and we have a huge gap to reconcile.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","We see the volumes in the market, so they are clearly coming from the illicit sources.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then just lastly, Jacek  on cash flow, you reiterated the objective of having a growth year-on-year, currency-neutral and free cash flow, but it's down quite substantially in the first quarter. I think that's the second consecutive first quarter with a substantial decline in cash flow. Can you just speak to what happened in the discrete first-quarter cash flow? Why is it down and then you know what is going to be different in the remainder of the year? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","I think the developments on the finished goods, receivables and the tax payables, excise tax payables connected with corresponding volumes, build up inventories, they actually improved. We had one-off items you like, which was the timing of the payment of the withholding stocks on the profit which were to the U.S., which happen to take place in the first quarter of this year. If I take that that item out actually my free cash flow would be up, so we're still confident that the free cash flow for the full year can grow actually at the higher rate than our revenues.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","So debt repayment cash outflow was later in the year last year last year and it was in the first quarter this year?","Jacek Olczak","Happens to be. It will take place in the first quarter of this year.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","A couple of questions in Asia, so first just in terms of your margin performance there, clearly you had the impact of the Philippines volume there, but you had pretty strong volume in Japan as a result of the inventory movement, but the margins were still down. So, can you just help us understand the margin performance in Asia in Q1?","Jacek Olczak","I think it is mostly driven by Indonesia, the cost pressure the closed prices the raw material which we are using very manufacturing significantly increased over the last period, so we had the pressure of that and pricing in Indonesia has a tendency to be build over the year rather than just at the beginning of the year, so usually we had a slower start. I mean, you have a cost pressure coming from Indonesia and at the beginning we cannot offset it fully by the price and I think this should disappear during the year and actually Asia should be able to improve the margins for the full-year.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then in Japan, I think you called out share was down a little bit, called out the increased promotional activities from your competitor. So, can you just elaborate sort of the nature of those promotional activities? How much do you think that that's in part driven by the currency movement that's giving and JT more of the cost advantage in that market and do you think that that will continue to put a little bit more competitive pressure in your business and how you are sort of responding to that?","Jacek Olczak","Difficult for me to comment how JT's allocating their resources, but clearly the marketing promotional spend both, in terms of the new product introductions and the promotional support of existing products in the market from JT in first quarter was massive. And to that extent, yes, we lost some share on the Lark and Philip Morris.","However on a positive note, I haven't seen the Marlboro losing adult in a share. So, frankly speaking, I would read it as a positive on Marlboro that despite is a very high spend from a JT remain the market share of Marlboro, but I have to admit that Lark and put into lark and Philip Morris yet they contributed to summarize in the overall share.","We have launched two Lark brands towards the end of the quarter, so we don't see them in the quarter to innovative custom product behind the Lark and we also announced launch of the new Marlboro, highly innovative the first two capsule product, which will hit the market somewhere May-June. Our ambition is still to grow the share in Japan, but as I said, we are confronted with the most expense from the JT.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just lastly, in Australia just following the implementation of plain packaging, what kind of consumption performance or trends are you seeing? And then what is happening in terms of your actual volume?","Jacek Olczak","Okay, in Australia, we are roughly four months since the introduction of plain packaging. At this early stage, the Australian market has not yet shown any significant changes in consumer purchasing behavior. The volumes in the quarter were stable and this compared actually, with the 4% decline which tool place in the first quarter of last year. This stable volume, I believe, reflect the impact of disruptions in connection with the transition to the plain packaging last December, and there were some evidence with deflation, et cetera when manufacturers had to replace the old parts with the new parts.","Frankly speaking, based on the first quarter data, it would appear that consumer down trading might have accelerated slightly but this trend, however, has been a part of the Australian market for several years where the consumers are showing a bit more sensitivity to the rate of tax and the price increases. As you remember, in February this year, there was a price increase, I think, of around 4% in the market. So if take all of these things together, in short, I think at this moment, the impact of plain packaging itself is not yet evident in the market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","I just wanted to ask a little bit about price (inaudible). Maybe if you could give us some color on whether or not down trading pressures are increasing for your non-OECP markets. What's going on broadly with some of your price cuts and then your outlook for this as the year progresses?","Jacek Olczak","No, frankly speaking, I don\u2019t see that much of a pressure on the down trading. It will have to take the EU out of the equation although as you have noticed, (inaudible) continues quarter-on-quarter growth in the EU, even in Germany, recently. We see that the there the actually the premium segment is slightly growing. It is a phenomenon which we have not seen for a long time.","Outside EU, there are different forms of up trading. You see the premium segment growing in a number of markets. Indonesia, Turkey, Vietnam, big or small market. Russia, more up trading is happening from the low price segment to the new price segment. I think the premium segment in Russia is flat as we more or less have seen it over the year. So, no, I don\u2019t think it is that that much of the risks to us and worries which will come from the down trading. As you have seen in the Marlboro and Parliament, I should mention, they are growing across all geographies.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay, that\u2019s good. Then in terms of Japan, could you touch on what you think the likelihood for price increase, ahead of the consumption tax increase and April 2014 is (inaudible), what sort of necessary steps and timing of getting this to happen in the country?","Jacek Olczak","Japan, still is a market where there is sort of price control in to light. This would require the consent of Ministry of Finance and as you know, we are not the market leader on this market. So not necessarily we are calling the shot there. So there also we have to see whatever the tax announcement of the tax, the sale price increases at the beginning of the next year will happen because we also hear some news that maybe government want to change the policy. Nothing concrete but we will have to see that unfolds.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay, and then just my final question would be on NGP and just maybe an update on some of the progress again compared with your clinical trials and then recently the ATU has talked about their less harmful cigarettes and then their strategy to transfer their technology to their existing cigarettes. So I guess not necessarily new lines but I would like it if you could talk about your approach with your NGP and then how you plan on rolling that out and how you will address that either with your brand franchise or new lines and further pros and cons of these strategies?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we are progressing as per planned. With the clinical, the regulator engagement, and also with being ready to finally start building our manufacturing capability. As you remember we have a three platforms of NGPs which we are working on potentially simultaneously. I believe all of them altogether should address all consumers' needs which are in the market."," Our fundamentals of common denominator, behind the [platforms] is we are not going for the selective reduction of a small constituent, we just want to bring the level the old constituents down, so we focus on the reduction of changing the process from the combustions for heating etcetera, so that is our approach and we feel pretty confident about it.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Just quickly Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa and Latin America, Canada region both seem to have surprisingly strong price mix, particularly given the sort of geography of where the volume growth is being in South Africa. Can you explain why that is?","Jacek Olczak","Potentially the of North Africa, so Egypt, other locations as well. We are also benefiting from some disruptions, which we had on our supply chain, especially at the beginning of the last year. As you remember, there were some disturbances connected with springs affects us, but once we brought the stability to our supply chain, our brands are in a full distribution, I mean they clearly reaping benefits of this.","I think in Latin America, price increase which we taken in Brazil. I think there was pricing in the Mexico at the beginning of the year, pricing in Argentina. I think in the first quarter, I think all together this contributes to the stronger pricing contribution coming from this and also the volumes as I mentioned North Africa especially.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Just with regards if you ignore the Philippines and look at the sort of various trade inventory movements that have occurred in the first quarter, because obviously there's positives in Japan, Russia and negatives in Turkey and Ukraine. I mean, excluding the Philippines is that being a net benefit to sales line or negative?","Jacek Olczak","No. I think, it's positive from Japan and positive in Russia and there's essentially two places where we had positive. I think still the negatives would offset this so that had a drag on quarter rather than a benefit, if you like, in a quarter.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Your pricing, in the quarter was very strong. I mean, at that rate do you think you would be able to exceed this to 1.8 billion from last year in cost variance?","Jacek Olczak","For obvious reasons, I cannot comment about the future pricing, but yes I mean as the quarter indicates indicate that the pricing is strong and is obviously supported also by the pretty pragmatic if I [say] so tax regimes. I mean, again excluding the Philippines, which we discuss separately. So, you know it's a good pricing environment and that would have a stronger pricing volume.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Okay. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi. Good morning. I just had a couple of country related questions for you, Jacek. The first one is in relation to the Philippines. I just was curious about two factors. One would be that you are seeing some low price competition, and I guess I was curious is Fortune not going to lower prices or get more promotional work to read that. Then related to that, Marlboro did relatively well, so I am just curious as to price gaps and it was very early there, but the price gaps are at all allowing for some better performance of premium brands.","Jacek Olczak","Well, as we said, unfortunate thing about the Philippines Stock Exchange is the magnitude of the change in a short period of time, the magnitude of an increase. However, immigration of the reductions to [TOs] on a full specific system they do support it, the narrow the price gaps narrow. So, clearly Marlboro going forward should benefit from closer of the gaps in a relative terms.","When it comes to the lower price competition, I think we have to remember about one thing. Philippines is a big pricing market, okay? So, dollars can cut the prices on their own in the outlet. There are about 1 million outlets in Philippines out of which we have about a quarter, roughly about a quarter, so what our self have to go and manage the right the right price per stick, which is important in that market and price per pack and bring the price down to the recommended level.","That\u2019s clearly something which we are doing in the first quarter. I think its going to continue very heavily in the second quarter. That obviously requires some extra spending. But, I think, once we bring the prices to the recommended level, we should be in a good situation.","I also should mention that the sequential evolution in the volumes, if anything, when we started the year, I think the first week of the year, our shipments were down by about 50%, very quickly will move to the 40%, then the 30% decline. Actually, if I look at, essentially the last few days, we almost had a 20% something decline.","So we know that the total market goes in the right direction which I have to manage the price and address or help the government or hope that the government will improve the tax collection from all market participants.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. The other question I have for you is in relation to Russia. Marlboro had a bit of a softer performance. I was curious if that was somehow related to inventory movements a year ago. I know that inventory overall was a benefit to Russia. Then, just to understand the investments you made in that market. I know Marlboro has been a really key focus for you. any comments on that or any relation to the weaker performance this quarter?","Jacek Olczak","Okay, investment in Russia is behind Marlboro but also behind the Parliament, L&M and a number of other brands. We, in general, still think the much stronger, much robust infrastructure, sales, marketing infrastructure, as much as the Marlboro in which we are investing. Obviously, Marlboro is our focus, as you know, it\u2019s the only brand which internally we have a much higher expectation for the performance.","There is a significant price increase. So I will have to wait a little bit how the prices, or how the situation tabulate in the market. I would argue that Marlboro, essentially, for the last few quarters in Russia is flat. We obviously shoot higher. But for the time being, it is flat.","Marlboro, over the past two years, took RUB 5 higher price increases than the rest of the market, because in the meantime we are trying to reposition the Marlboro really to the premium segment. So if I take all the large price increases in Russia and Marlboro adding on the top of this RUB 5, and I had a brand stable for the last few quarters, I think it is actually a good thing about the rest. However, we still have to wait until the Marlboro markets is going to grow.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","I want to ask a question on Indonesia first. Just to understand how you think about the competitive threat, if any, from the Gudang Garam Mild that just launched a couple of weeks ago. Obviously, it is just new in the market but they are doing TV commercials, they have got a little bit of a price discount to A Mild. Is that something that you might stand to defend against or do you see that, Mild has been obviously a lot of share gains. Dow do you think about that as an addition to the competitive equation?","Jacek Olczak","Well, as you remember, last year, we grew the share hold by almost by three point. With this quarter, we open with almost 1.5 point share advancement. Obviously our share continues to grow. A have to admit that the last year, our share growth was somehow supported by the more attractive price points for a number of our key brand. Some of this, as we take in continuously the pricing and increasing the pricing in Indonesia, some of this attractive price point, we are going to lose.","But we are still looking into the share growth in Indonesian. We are launching our product. We are expanding our product as well. So I don\u2019t its any sort of track that you will be able to see at this stage coming from, frankly speaking, in a competitive right now.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then, I know you have touched on this a little bit but can you give us some from color on the pacing. You said the second half would be stronger but the 2Q and 3Q are your easiest comparisons and so can you just highlight some more of the reasons that 2Q wouldn\u2019t also be a strong or what will help 4Q that the second half would be stronger just what some of the drivers are that shape how the year plays out?","Jacek Olczak","Okay, I think the reason why I said that we think second half of this year to be stronger than the first half, there are a few reasons. One is, we have a new annualization. We have ","annualization of the increased spending we started already in the first half of 2012. This was mainly Russia, but also some Asian market. It's also in the timing of our launches which we had the in first half of the last year versus the first half of this year.","Secondly, as I mentioned that we have to increase our spending in Philippines towards the end of the first quarter and I think is going to continued through the second quarter towards the situation which we have with compliance with the recommended prices at the retail level and also to address some competitive pressures there.","Also, if you remember we already in February that the three-quarters of 75% of our pricing was already been pretty heavily year. So, yes I mean some of these volumes will have to recover and that recovery in some places may continue through the Q2. Then obviously is also the shipment patterns which were having some market with some distortions may continue, will continue actually for the Q2. So, as I said we expect the second half to be stronger than the first half of this year.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","That's helpful. Then just my last question, you've talked before about opportunity that it could be the regain even sort of your fair share of illicit trade or just the stem that growth even, but it seems to be still more of a threat than an opportunity. What could make that tide turn? I know you've put money into Poland things, but how far off is that from having any impact? When should we see that actually start to become something that is heading the other way instead of gaining share?","Jacek Olczak","This is a process. Okay? It's going to take time. I mentioned Turkey in my remarks is one of the markets where despite the prices increases etcetera, tax increase and the price increases, government doing a lot of right things on illicit trade, and we see that through volume coming to the industry. I mean despite the tax and the price increase in Turkey we still think that the volumes for the full year helped by the recovery of illicit trade is going to be flat, so we can see that.","I think also that recently I think this week in EU is going to be another serious wakeup call to the number of the states in EU, because letting the contraband growing from a 10-plus percent last year to 11-plus percent this year in the middle of this crisis, I mean it doesn't necessarily tells the good thing about the number of the law enforcement authorities in the many of the EU countries, but this is going to take time. I admit it. We are working with Interpol, we are working on tightening the supply chain. There is cooperation among the industry members, the legitimate industry members, but more has to be done.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Good morning. I think you alluded to it already, but in markets like Italy and the EU you have a down trading market yet the premium brands that you have there are gaining market share. Can you give us a little bit more background how the dynamics there work?","Jacek Olczak","Well, first of all there is a number of the brand support activities, which were deploying behind Marlboro, okay? The whole commercial organization, commercial approach which we have already announced at the time on Investors Day last year here, and we start yielding results.","Second, in most of the countries the tax regimes are actually more and more supporting or not allowing for the too much of the down trading. I mean the price gaps despite the fact that they are price increases tends to narrow, so you know they have the minimum taxes, very high minimum taxes, or just the specific structure. I think this all together has clearly brand like Marlboro, but I think Marlboro quarter-after-quarter in terms of a EEMA's equity etcetera is getting into better and better shape.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Okay. Then in Japan for the last three quarters, your market share has been drifting down again after the post tsunami gains. What's your outlook? At what point you can actually maintain your year-over-year market shares in Japan?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I still think that we can make a share advancement in Japan. I mean, the quarterly 27.5%. I mean, that's not what we would expect, so I think the. There are still three quarters to go. We have a pipeline of our products and the programs there in place, but as I said earlier, answering one of the previous questions, there is a massive support from JT behind the Mevius in terms of the product promotion. The other manufacturers are already pretty active with launching their product. It's a competitive environment.","I look at this also positively that despite that there is a massive spending and activity coming from a competition or competitor, Marlboro actually is extremely resilient. I mean, that said, that's very important for us. We will have to address the situations with Lark, Philip Morris going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Just a brief question on the United Kingdom and the outlook for plain packaging in there. I thought the comment on the Australia were helpful. But what do you see in terms of the risk of the U.K. government moving forward on plain packaging and how do you see such a move does occur affecting the approaches if other governments within the EU that have expressed interest, such as the Irish most recently?","Jacek Olczak","Well, not much strategies on the U.K. actually because the government still have not revealed what is the conclusion of the public consultation in pack assessment, et cetera. So we are waiting for the decision of the government in which directions they really want to go. At the same time as you know there is still a tobacco product directive which is in the making,","There are still pretty important steps to go over the tobacco product directive. We will then have a much better visibility, really how many markets are key and if you like I am willing to introduce the plain packaging in many markets over there. As you know the plain packaging in European Union also at the member states level has the number of legal challenges for its implementation. So we will have to see.","And as I said, so far it's early, but so far especially on the smoking, on consumption of cigarette in Australia, you don't really see, as expected, frankly speaking, any impact coming from the plain packaging, despite what was promised at the beginning. So as evidenced, I have got the feeling its not being built in Australia. I mean there is still no evidence.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Rogerio Fujimori of Credit Suisse.","Rogerio Fujimori - Credit Suisse","Jacek, could you talk a bit about your other two big markets in the EU, France and Spain? Particularly in France, you reported market volumes down 8.6%, but in the last call you flag a decline of 3.4% in January. So is it fair to say that cigarette volumes are getting worse? Then in Spain I think you reported cigarette market volume down 15%. So, I was just wondering about the shape of the quarter and the underlying decline in this market?","Jacek Olczak","I think that France is still, towards the end of the last year we had a price increase in France. So market is still in the recovery. Although I have to admit that macros in the France are not the most encouraging, right. The employment, the GDP, et cetera are not necessarily going in the right direction.","Spain also had the beginning of the year price increase, but early in January. I think there was a $0.15 price increase in Spain. So we will have to wait presumably a few months to see how the situation develops there.","But as I said this is all both France and Spain as we see today are all in my forecast or estimate of the total market decline for the EU to be broadly in a range of last year. Italy, I will repeat it as well, I mean it\u2019s the only country. The main country which I have on the watch list with regards to the VAT development.","Rogerio Fujimori - Credit Suisse","Okay, and then secondly, you mentioned that we should expect some trade inventory distortions in the second quarter. Could you just elaborate on that to help us with our models please? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","I think it would be mainly in Asia and mainly still in Japan. I think the last quarter when we rebuild our inventories to the safety level what we require to what we regard as a safety level for the Japanese markets to place in the Q2, if you remember properly of last year. So clearly I will be missing this one this year.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.","Nicholas Rolli","Thank you very much. That concludes our call today.

(Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, Sir.","Nick Rolli","Thank you. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 fourth quarter and full year results and you may access the release on our web site at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, and comparing them to the same periods in 2012, unless otherwise stated. Our references to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources.","Net revenues exclude excise taxes, operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net. Our OCI growth rates are on an adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs.","Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our web site.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer period. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As expected, we finished 2013 with a strong fourth quarter. While our cigarette volume declined by 1.9%, excluding the Philippines, our net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 2.5% and 12.7%, respectively, excluding currency.","Most importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 19.4% on an ex-currency basis. Our results were strong across all four regions. Adjusted OCI, excluding currency, increased in the fourth quarter by 2.6% in the EU region, 22.5% in EEMA, 7.4% in Asia and by 34.9% in the Latin America and Canada region.","On a full year basis, EEMA and Latin America and Canada grew adjusted OCI at a double-digit rate in 2013, excluding currency. For the full year 2013, our reported diluted EPS reached $5.26. This includes the $0.10 charge for the restructuring of our business in Egypt, which we announced last week, as well as $0.04 in charges that we had previously disclosed. Consequently, our adjusted diluted EPS was $5.40 in 2013. Excluding the unfavorable currency of $0.34 per share, this represents a growth rate of 10% compared to the previous year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22.","Currencies, particularly in emerging markets continue to be extremely volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, we project $0.71 in unfavorable currency in our EPS guidance for 2014. Emerging markets account for nearly 60% of this total. The fact that we are currently hedged for approximately 60% of our forecast sales to Japan, with an effective rate of \u00a5 95 to the $1, is included in this projection.","Our results confirm that our business fundamentals are robust. However, as I outlined in November, we expect to continue to face specific challenges in 2014. Those affected our full year 2013 results. Furthermore, we intend to make significant investments in and increase expenditures behind our reduced-risk products in preparation for city pilot tests later this year and our first national launch in 2015, as well as additional investments behind our current portfolio. Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at prevailing exchange rates is in a range of $5.02 to $5.12 versus $5.16 in 2013.","Our 2014 guidance corresponds to a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 6% to 8%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013.","Japan is projected to remain a challenging market for us in 2014. The government is increasing the consumption tax in April from 5% to 8%. The related retail price pass on is around \u00a5 14 per pack. We have applied to the Minister of Finance for approval to increase the prices of our Marlboro, Lark and Philip Morris brands by \u00a5 20 per pack and other brands by up to \u00a5 10 per pack.","Subject to approval by the Minister of Finance, the new prices are expected to take effect on April 3. The new prices are expected to result in a slight acceleration of the total market decline to around 3% to 3.5% in 2014, compared to the 2% decline of 2015.","Our overall market share declined in 2013 from 27.7% to 26.7%, and to 25.9% in the fourth quarter. This was driven principally by the success of new competitive products in the menthol segment and was somewhat distorted by the pipelining of competitive product launches in the fourth quarter.","Marlboro remains resilient and should be boosted by the rollout of the Don\u2019t Be A Maybe, Be Marlboro campaign that has been successful in numerous markets in the European Union and other regions.","We also have plans to introduce various new product offers under the Marlboro and Lark trademarks. Barring any unforeseen adverse competitive price reaction, we expect that these launches coupled with increased spending to support them should enable us to stabilize our market share during the year. However we do expect that our 2014 average share will be below the 2013 average.","The second challenging market in Asia is the Philippines. We estimate the local manufacturer Mighty Corporation is producing about double the volume that it declares to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. This has prevented us from being able to operate on a level playing field and continues to result in a significant tax revenue loss for the government.","The planned implementation of a system of fiscal stamps in the second quarter this year will hopefully help to address this issue. We are continuing to encourage the authorities to act decisively and welcome the decision of Congress to hold hearings on this matter as well as the decision of the Bureau of Customs to suspend the license of Mighty Corporation to operate a customs bonded warehouse.","Since the end of November, we have seen the Mighty brand stick price gradually rise from PHP1 to PHP1.50, and the Marvels brand stick price rise to PHP1.25. This is a positive development. However, their Marvels brand is still selling at a wholesale price of PHP183 per carton, which is below the PHP191 required merely to cover the new excise tax and VAT enforced as of January this year.","We do not know at this stage how Mighty Corporation intends to reflect the new tax levels. On the demand side, the good news is that, while tax paid industry volume was down by 15.6% to an estimated 86.3 billion units in 2013 Nielsen data indicates that there was only a minor decline in actual consumption.","Adult smoking incidence and adult daily consumption remained at similar levels in the second half of 2013 to those that prevailed in 2012. In light of the significant tax driven price increases incurred by Marlboro and Fortune, total consumption was sustained by adult smoker down-trading to the then PHP 1 per stick price segment. This super-low price segment increased its share from 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 41.2% in the same period in 2013, mainly at the expense of our premium and mid-price brands.","While we have enforced our segment participation, our overall market share in the fourth quarter declined by 14.9 points to 72.3%. Our ability to enhance our profitability through higher prices remains constrained by the flexibility that Mighty Corporation derives from its tax under declaration.","In the meantime, the investments we are making to defend our business are shared with our partners. We continue to hold a clear leading share in the market - in a market where annual adult consumption is estimated at around 100 billion units and we have the brand portfolio and the national distribution to take advantage of the planned future tax equalization. We thus remain optimistic that once the current hurdles are overcome the Philippines will be a significant contributor to our profit growth in the region.","While discussing Asian markets, let me provide an update on Indonesia, where total industry volume increased by 1.9% in 2013 to an estimated 380 billion units. The slower industry volume growth can be in large part attributed to the economic slowdown and the impact of higher fuel and food prices on lower income adult consumers. In fact, during 2013, the volume of premium and mid-priced cigarettes increased by 5.2% and 3.4%, respectively, while the volume of low-priced brands declined by 6.6%.","In 2014, we expect industry volume growth to moderate to around 1% due to the weaker economy and expected significant price increases in the low price category following the introduction of a new regulation restricting the preferential tax treatment of so-called sister companies. In 2013, our market share grew by 0.5 points to 36.1%, driven by the strong performance of our lighter-tasting, machine-made kretek brands Sampoerna A and U Mild, as well as by Marlboro in the White segment.","In the fourth quarter, their share growth was more than offset by a weaker performance of our hand-rolled kretek brands, Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna Kretek, due to the segment's decline and the fact that they both sell currently at disadvantageous price points compared to competitive brands.","In 2014, we expect to benefit from the continued growth of the lighter-tasting machine made kretek segment, which increased by 1.9 points to 40.5% last year in which Sampoerna A and U Mild had a growing 46.4% segment share. In addition, we are gaining share in the full flavor machine-made kretek segment with Dji Sam Soe Magnum. Finally, we believe that the government's introduction in January of a regional tax of 10% should be manageable as it equates to a pass on of between 3% and 6%.","Let me now turn to the European Union region. In the fourth quarter, cigarette industry volume in the region declined by 5.8%, at rate of decline similar to the third quarter, reflecting a tangible moderation compared to the trend we witnessed in the first half of 2013.","Illicit trade appears to have stabilized, albeit at a high level. The expansion of the fine-cut category has slowed, given the compression of the tax and price differential with cigarettes. Finally, while still expanding in some markets, such as France, Spain and the U.K., the growth in demand for electronic cigarette in the region as a whole has decelerated. We therefore expect cigarette industry volume trends to show an improvement compared to the 7.5% decline in 2013, and are currently forecasting a decline in 2014, in a range of 6% to 7%.","The improvement is taking place in an environment where excise tax increases have been reasonable and structural improvements continue to take place. One market of concern is Italy, where the predominantly ad valorem structure is encouraging the growth of a super-low \u20ac4 per pack price segment and eroding the tax revenue base of the government. We hope that the Italian government will rapidly address this issue and implement the necessary tax reform. Until this materializes, we will prudently balance the delicate price, volume and profit equation in Italy.","In 2013, we increased our overall market share in the European Union region by 0.5 points to 38.5%. This was driven by the strength of our brand portfolio with Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris, all gaining share in the region. We expect this momentum to continue as our market share grew further to 38.6% in the fourth quarter.","Our share gains are very broadly based. We increased our market share in each of the six largest cigarette markets by volume in the full year 2013. Our continued share momentum positions us well for 2014, and we expect to be able to again outperform the industry.","I would also like to highlight our strong performance in the EEMA region, notably in Russia. Our strong pricing actions enabled us to continue to significantly expand our profitability in 2013, even though cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6%.","Despite the slower implementation of new retail prices by some of our competitors, we recorded only a modest share decline of 0.3 points to 26.1%. This was achieved in particular by the continued outperformance of above premium price Parliament.","In January of this year, the government implemented the next planned and largest excise tax increase resulting in an average pass on of RUB 8 a pack. In anticipation, we increased most of our maximum retail selling prices by RUB 9 per pack in December last year while prices will only go up at retail later this month.","For the full year 2014, we expect to continue to expand our profitability at a high single-digit rate even though cigarette industry volume is expected to decline by between 9% and 11%, reflecting price elasticity, illicit trade and a weaker economy.","Cigarette industry volume in Turkey was impacted by significant trade loading at the end of 2012 and by an increase in illicit trade in 2013. As a result, industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6% last year, while we estimate that the underlying decline was approximately 3.5%. Provided there is no further increase in illicit trade, we expect underlying cigarette industry volume to stabilize in 2014.","Our share has remained resilient in the face of increased price competition in the low and super low price segments, with a decline of just 0.2 points to 45.5% in 2013. We successfully line extended Chesterfield into the super low price segment and continued to improve our mix. Thanks to the success of Parliament in the premium and Muratti in the mid-price segments.","This January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum tax while maintaining the ad valorem rate unchanged. This resulted in a pass on of around TRY 0.28 per pack at the retail level. We increased the prices of our brands by around TRY 0.5 on average, thus boosting our unit margins. We achieved strong results across our Latin America and Canada region with share gains in Argentina, Brazil, Canada and Colombia and a stable 73.5% market share in Mexico.","Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, we increased our share in 2013 by 0.5 points to 34.9%. Our market share grew or was stable in 23 of these markets further emphasizing that our underlying business remains strong.","Marlboro has been a key driver of this excellent share momentum. In 2013, excluding China and the Philippines, Marlboro gained share in all four regions, with a particularly strong performance, not only in the EU region, but also in the Latin America and Canada region and across North Africa.","Our strong market share momentum should enable us to improve our volume performance in 2014 and outperform the industry. In 2013, we estimate that global cigarette industry volume, excluding the U.S.A. and China, declined by 3%. This year, we are forecasting a decline in a range of 2% to 3%.","Pricing was the key driver behind our income improvement, excluding currency in 2013. We achieved a pricing variance of $2.1 billion. This was above our historical average reflecting the timing of tax driven price increases and unusually large gains due to inventory movements, most notably in the Philippines. In 2014, we expect these gains to be lower. Consequently, the first quarter's EPS growth rate, excluding currency, is expected to be below our average for the year.","Please note that as of today, we have implemented or announced almost 60% of the pricing that is built into our 2014 earnings per share guidance.","While revenue growth remains the key driver of our business growth, we continue to be very focused on cost controls and productivity gains. Our adjusted OCI margin, increased by 0.6 points in 2013, excluding currency, from 45.4% to 46%. This is in part attributable to the successful completion of cost savings and productivity improvement programs, which generated over $300 million in 2013. We target a further $300 million in annual productivity gains in 2014, which should moderate inflationary input cost increases.","We have recently completed four business development projects that will be accretive to earnings in 2014. We repurchased the remaining 20% shareholding from our business partner in Mexico. We took a 49% participation in Arab Investors-TA, which is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of international brands of cigarettes in Algeria.","We purchased a 20% shareholding in our Russian distributor, Megapolis. Finally, we have restructured our business in Egypt to enhance our growth and income potential in this 80 billion unit market. These business development projects are expected to have a net positive EPS impact of approximately $0.10 in 2014.","In 2013, we increased our free cash flow, excluding unfavorable currency, by 11.8% to $9.4 billion. As foreseen, the growth rate exceeded that of net earnings, driven largely by a reduction in working capital. In 2014, we expect free cash flow to be unfavorably impacted by currency and a foreseen increase in working capital at the end of this year attributable to the timing of excise tax increases and related inventory movements.","We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In September last year, we increased our dividend by a further 10.6%, bringing the cumulative increase since 2008 to 104.3%. Our target dividend payout ratio remains an attractive 65% and our dividend yield last Friday was 4.8%","Last year, we spent $6 billion to repurchase 67.2 million shares. We also spent over $2 billion on the four business development opportunities that I described. As a result, given both the projected significant unfavorable currency impact on our reported results in 2014, and the fact that we are approaching the high end of the ratios supporting our credit rating, we are scaling back our target share repurchases in 2014, $4 billion.","Please note that the rating agencies use different methodologies, some preferring to use gross rather than net debt measures and some weighting the company's cash position differently from other.","As we emphasized last November, 2014 is going to be a pivotal year for reduced risk products, our greatest growth opportunity. Last month, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing facility near Bologna, Italy. That, along with a pilot plant in the same area, will provide an annual capacity of up to 30 billion units. The associated capital expenditures of up to \u20ac500 million are within the previously disclosed range of \u20ac500 to \u20ac600 million.","This year, we will obtain the results of the clinical trials that we started in 2013. The data from these studies will be an essential part of our evidence package to substantiate the use of our Platform 1 product results in a biological impact profile close to that of cessation.","During the first half of this year, we will continue with our perception and behavioral studies and finalize the packaging and labeling anticipation of planned city pilot tests in the second half of 2014 and our first national launch in 2015. In addition, we plan to enter the electronic cigarette market during the second half of 2014.","As previously disclosed, we will increase our reduced risk product-related expenditures in R&D, operations and commercial activities by more than $100 million this year in order to meet this accelerated schedule.","In conclusion, 2014 will be a very important year as we increase our investments behind both, our conventional and our reduced-risk products. The outlook for the Philippines and for the EU region as a whole is improving while Japan remains a significant challenge. We enter 2014 with robust fundamentals and good market share momentum behind our superior brand portfolio led by Marlboro. In addition, our profitability will benefit from the four business development projects that I outlined. However, currency volatility in emerging markets has increased significantly and we are only one month into the year.","Our expectation is that we should be able, as of 2015, to meet our annual currency-neutral net revenues and adjusted OCI targets. Of course, the level of our share repurchases will depend on the impact of exchange rates, the interest rate environment and corporate tax reform here in the U.S.","There are a number of important factors that underpin our belief, sequential improvements in the performance of challenging markets, in particular the Philippines, further structural improvements in excise tax systems, notably in the EU region; a superior brand portfolio, led by a reinvigorated Marlboro; strong pricing power based on our brands, an increased focus on cost controls and productivity gains and our commercialization of reduced risk products. Finally, our strong free cash flow will be used to reward our shareholders through general dividends and share repurchase programs. Thank you.","Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question and answer session of the conference. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Andr\u00e9. A couple of quick things, Andr\u00e9. First, on the dividend. It's obviously a Board decision, but do you think there is a willingness this year to further take the payout ratio above the 65% target, so that there could be dividend growth?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","David, you said it yourself. It's the Board decision. However, the Board takes into consideration a number of factors, 65% target being one. Clearly, if you look at our history, we have a history of rewarding generously our shareholders even in turbulent times. That's what I can tell you.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then, Andre, in the Philippines, you gave a lot of statistics and data, but could you explain? If you don't look necessarily at declared tax volume by your competitor, what really ultimately matters to you right is what's being reflected in the marketplace in terms of competitive pricing, and if you were to benchmark Mighty's price point versus Marlboro or Mighty's price point versus Fortune's, how much progress has there been made? How much more evident does it appear if there is competitively reflecting reality?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","David, clearly there is an improvement as I also said in my remarks. Clearly, we are seeing [the price] [ph] of the Mighty brand greater than 70% of the portfolio of Mighty Corporation going up to PHP1.50, although the price per carton does not yet reflect the second excise tax increase if we speak about reasonable economic returns.","What has also happened is they left behind one of their brands called Marvel that represents 30% of the portfolio and roughly 6% to 7% of the market. Until this brand also goes to the right price point and price gap, clearly we are also obliged to maintain some presence in the segment.","In summary, this is all about achieving the right price gaps as I have previously explained, but in general to fix the price gaps either you do it from the top or from the bottom, it appears that some progress is made to achieve this from the bottom.","We need to wait until the new tax is reflected across the Mighty Corporation portfolio. Then as I said, there may be some upside in there. Now, they are still under declaring from what we understand based on mix and tax stamp [inaudible] a very large part, roughly half of their volume which helps them subsidize the lower price, but there is progress. There is increasing pressure on them. There are hearings in the Congress and also the fact that they lost their bonded warehouse, which we understand they were used to kind of declare that the products or the raw materials are for exports but essentially been used locally so that the pressure is mounted.","We are kind of optimistic, but we'll know better as the year unfolds. Also to say, if we look at the outlook for next year, clearly, I think in terms of Philippines, probably we'll reach the bottom of the negative impact and we can only go better next year both in comparative and even in absolute terms.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask you first, Andr\u00e9, in relation to the Philippines and having the government pressure in the company. Obviously, the price point still being too low, but can you give some information about the warehouse being shut down and taken the license away. Is that not forcing like in a more immediate movement by the company to raise prices at retail. That's not happening as quickly as you maybe thought it would?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Difficult question to answer. Yes. The pressure should be there, because it's becoming extremely visible to the general public and the media, so we should expect some move but we need to see this move. That's all. Okay?","Now, the other limitation on the Philippines that I explained in previous times is that over the long-term the tax system clearly is locked in our favor, because it closes the gaps top to bottom in a normal operating market and also allows us as the two tax tiers equalize to unleash a bit more pricing power of the mid-price brand because today the mid-price brands are down.","By the way, the excise tax or the price of the different excise tax tiers is calculated which as you take the retail price you remove VAT and the excise tax and government ignores completely the retail margin which as we know is pretty hefty up to 20% and that's the price and that ex-factory price that determines the price tier which are classified and we have to be very careful on how much pricing we can take for Fortune for example not to jump in the upper tier. As the two tiers close over time, one or two years then you have much more pricing power from that perspective.","Other development also that is positive in the Philippines, good at least, is that there will be pack stickers implemented towards the end of the first half of the year and we have to see how this impacts Mighty but definitely is another positive to us, so that's why longer term we are very optimistic about the Philippines, but still this year it has the impact I described on our profitability, it was about [inaudible].","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Okay. That's good color. Thank you. I just had a quick follow-up question for you on Japan. Understand that you are calling it still a significantly challenged market I think it was the term you used. It seems like they are going to get some pricing through that.","I just want to be clear, is that going to be more than the tax increase? And if that is the case even if it declines a little bit more than the 2% underlying rate, wouldn\u2019t that make for a better Japan in 2014, maybe that which you assume before?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","This is very early days in Japan. We have submitted our request to the Ministry of Finance, but it is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. If that holds and we hold it well, yes, it will give some positive pricing in Japan.","However, we need to put this in the context of and that depends also what other competitors are doing of some additional potential impact on our share and also the fact that we may need to put some promotional, additional money to support that price level. Again, it's early days. It's subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance, but there is some small upside over there.","Chris Growe - Stifel","","Okay. Thank you very much for the answers.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Andr\u00e9, we can appreciate the fact that you are willing to invest more into the business in 2014 to compete more effectively in some of your challenged markets. If I take a step back though, one of the drivers that's causing you to perhaps spend a little bit more is maybe the emergence of some of the newer competition, whether it's the local discount player like Mighty or JTI getting more aggressive in Japan or you've got the illicit trade that's picked up?","I just want to get your perspective on why you think you are confident that the spending you are making in 2014 is really enough to put you in a position to compete more effectively to drive the company to grow in line with your long-term target in 2015 and beyond.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Okay. First of all, the investment as we described is, one part is going behind our reduced risk product, okay? Clearly this is longer term as we were starting some volume in this product [in 2013] [ph], okay.","Now, regarding the existing business, of course, there is need for investment in Japan and that is also to support our product introductions at the Marlboro campaign and other initiatives that I described. Some other markets where business needs are, we are ramping the investment. For example, Indonesia, okay? That's part of that normal business spending.","Clearly, the investment in the Philippines is another type of investment. It's not a promotion or a marketing investment. It's more investing in our margins by holding the right price gaps and that's where the big investment is.","As I explained this one, I believe this year clearly we see the bottom of the problem, and we can grow significantly out of this, just remaining flat year-to-year in the Philippines in terms of profitability it will increase by 1% of growth, [it just swings] [ph] 2 growth points, okay.","I think also that for 2016 one element is our cost base in terms of manufacturing cost, will gradually improve. Already, if we see the growth of our manufacturing cost, it was 3.8% in 2013. It's going down to 3.2% this year and will further decrease next year and that's a positive addition.","The conditions in Europe, I think, will slightly improve. We still have strong price base and we have a number of portfolio initiatives, including new initiatives on Marlboro I will describe in more detail in CAGNY.","All that makes me fairly confident that after 2015, we can reach our revenue and operating companies' income target. And I don't even take into consideration Japan, which can certainly improve compared to the impact we have this year as we are lapping the year, where the actual product introductions happened in Japan and where Japan Tobacco got their fair share of excitement, which I remind everybody that were not existing before. Thank you.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then just on the share buyback outlook for 2014, I can appreciate you're sort of looking at the rating agencies and the metrics that they looked at. We also looked at your stock price and valuation and it seems like really an opportune time if \u2013 certainly if the fundamentals are improving as we expect them to that it might be more of an opportune time to get more aggressive on the buyback. So, I just want to understand kind of your thinking process on the moderation in terms of the buyback. Is it really the currency issue? Are you willing to take on more U.S. dollar-denominated debt to kind of fund the buyback? What's sort of the thinking process there?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Okay. I mean, currency clearly plays an important role here. Different agencies look at ratings in different ways as I said, ranging from total debt to EBITDA to net debt or adjusted net debt and one element in the adjusted net debt is that rating agencies start taking cash abroad at a discount, because, I mean, applying a theoretical, say corporate income tax rate, if that cost were to be repatriated in the U.S., so that reduces the capacity and you can do the math very easily yourself.","The currency impact we just announced at prevailing rates, that is to stick for the year. It's at the cash flow levels, it's roughly $1.1 billion and at your EBITDA level is $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion, so that takes a lot of share repurchase capacity out and as the year unfolds, we need to reevaluate the situation, so the other thing we need to note is we had $2 billion of business development projects that we just accomplished and frankly speaking, they're much more accretive to the shareholders than the share buybacks.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","The 2 billion, I'd say that's the $0.10 accretion that you called out in the\u2026?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","It is net.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","It is the net? Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","It is net of the impact it has on the lesser share repurchase.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Understood. Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Good afternoon, Gentlemen. Just sort of a bit of a follow on. Just to clarify again. Apologies for this one on the share repurchase. When you say getting towards the high end of your ratios for the credit rating agencies, do you mean that that by the end of 2014, you'll be towards planned and\/or currently believe and therefore, in essence, you're flagging that perhaps in 2015 they'll have the cash returns or \u2013 will have to be more in line with cash flow and leverage held sort of more flat in 2015? Is that a reasonable assumption?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Well, first of all, our current ratios are already at close to the upper end and had we continued with the $6 billion share buyback, we will have exceeded the ratios during the year if the currencies remain where they are today. Okay?","This is one of the reasons, because what I would reiterate is that we want to absolutely maintain our rating. We had to moderate our share repurchase product. Now, looking at 2015 is a bit early days to say exactly what the target share buyback is going to be.","I mean, I would like to see how the situation in the currencies unfolds during the year and then we'll take a decision later on. It's a bit very early to call it. I mean, clearly, we are [Inaudible] share buybacks, and the corridor in which we operate is, on one side, a credit rating upper limit and on the other side 100% cash outflow to the shareholders through dividends and share buybacks and we will always operate within that corridor in the future. That depends on currencies, interest rates, and longer term tax reforms in the U.S., I'm stating the obvious. Okay?","Jon Leinster - UBS","But you are going to maintain that credit rating?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Yes.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Okay. Secondly, the Latin America or\/and Canada region in the fourth quarter looks very strong profit performance in the fourth quarter. Is there anything, can you detail anything in particular that's behind that? Particular market or.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","It's a bit across the market, okay? It's also depending on the timing of price increases in Argentina as we know Argentina is an inflationary environment and we need approval from the Ministry of Finance all the time, the Minister of Economy. So, sometimes we have a delayed approval and that's partially what happened also in last quarter. We got the approval later, so we had to time differently the price increases.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Got it. Lastly, just on the EU, if you see EU volumes are down sort of 5.5 or thereabouts in the second half of 2013. Why do you expect to get somewhat worse in 2014 sort of six to seven?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","This is the best we can see to-date, okay. There is still some pricing that has to take place. The situation clearly looks slightly better last two quarters and I hope it's going to be confirmed in the first quarter 2014, okay? So, that's the forecast to the best of my knowledge to-date.","Jon Leinster - UBS","There's no change in terms of, there's no obvious signs that the governments particularly in Southern Europe are cracking down on illicit or something's changing in the market?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","We don't have the latest, latest figure of the global survey in the European Union. What I hear from the different markets, it seems to have stabilized. Clearly, it has improved in Italy. It's slightly up in France, but we see stability although the base remains high, so I think that if it doesn't get lost during the year and frankly, we don't have disruptive taxes in the European Union. Maybe we'll be slightly better, but today I cannot confirm that. I want a quarter more to be in a position to confirm.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg","","Hi. Good afternoon. Firstly, with respect to the foreign exchange headwind, could you break apart in that 13% or $0.71, how much is transactional and within that, how much is related directly to Japan. Then with respect to the transactional component at prevailing rates is it fair to think that that would disappear in 2015?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Okay. Look, I can't give you the absolute precise number for the breakdown between translational and transactional. I think [Inaudible] 20%, but Jacek is here. He can give you a breakdown.","Jacek Olczak","No. You are right. Andr\u00e9 is right about last year. It's about 80% of our import was coming from translations and the remaining 20% was the transactional. With regards to the impact our $0.71 per share currency impact about 30% of the $0.71 versus the last year is coming from yen and 70% is essentially across all currencies and then there is a strong impact coming from Indonesian rupiah, ruble, Turkish lira and a number of other currencies.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg","","Okay. Thank you. Then with respect to the plain packaging, I was just wondering if you could comment on an article that appeared in The Scotsman suggesting that, PMI was suggesting if plain packaging was passed in Scotland, that country could be liable for GBP 500 million in compensation for the intellectual property.","I was wondering what does that imply. Then if plain packaging goes forward in markets like Ireland and the U.K., can we gross up the amounts that might be expected based on the volumes there. Then just wondering what the status was of the WTO challenge and the BIT arbitration? Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Okay. The article you are referring to, Erik, I have no idea. Frankly speaking, it is pure speculation, because I haven't seen or articulated any related number. Okay, first of all, we are far away from being in this situation, as you know, both into the U.K. and Ireland. It's just political talk for the time being and I don't see any new evidence has appeared in the horizon to justify even the U.K. reopening the issue.","Now coming to the real concrete case, we have in front of us, which is Australia. Okay? If you look at the facts in Australia, is that plain packaging has no impact on prevalence or incidence after a year it is in the market, okay?","I don't know where you can find stronger evidence about the impact, and, yes, we see a little bit of down trading, but we had foreseen this and that's part of what we explained in the BIT case.","Regarding the cases, WTO is proceeding and the BIT case, if I'm not mistaking, a fresh hearing after submissions of written arguments from both parties is towards the end of February, actually this month, so we will see how this unfolds. As we always said, this is not a process that is going to take months. It's going to take still a year-and-a-half two years, okay?","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg","","Okay. Thank you. My last question then was with respect to illicit, and I was just wondering I appreciated the comments on illicit in Europe, but how would you characterize it globally for PMI's markets? Related to that, what are the prospects of recapturing illicit volume and what are the factors necessary for that? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Look, the only outburst of illicit is clearly the Philippines, okay? I think I have explained lengthily the situation. We are all aware of the problem, but that's illicit trend in a different form. That's a form we see increasingly in some places and that's probably the form that is the easiest finally to address, because it takes action from the government.","A painful process in the Philippines, but that can be addressed. For the rest of the illicit trade, which is essentially illicit wide, we always said that the best way to address this is through the supply chain and especially asset in total and I think we are making very good progress in that area.","Not yet done, but the progress, the awareness amongst the companies that produced in their efforts fairly confident and hopeful that by the end of the year we'll see tangible results. That\u2019s one of the best ways to tackle illicit trade. I think that our prospects to reduce the illicit trade our objective is over the next one to two years to stabilize it and we are working with many governments as you know around the planet to achieve this and then gradually reduce it, but even stabilizing it is a great thing to achieve.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Andre, I think this time last year you had already 75% of the pricing that you needed for your guidance. I think you just said that you are now at 60%. Can you give us the details why it's so much lower?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Nothing particular that I can point to, okay? As we said last year, we had a bit more of inventory movement in the Philippines that was lower this year, because the tax increase was lesser. That\u2019s one thing and the rest is pure timing. Indonesia is every year is the same. We start with the tax at the beginning of the year and gradually increase, so nothing particular to worry about.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","We shouldn\u2019t read into that you are may be taking a more cautious approach to your pace of price increases.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I think our pricing policy is very simple. We take a lot of factors into consideration, affordability price gaps, excise tax and our pricing is every year very strong. I think, I explained in my remarks there's slight differences compared to this year.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Okay, and then the other question I had in your conclusion of your prepared remarks. You pointed out that you expect to get back to your normal growth rate for revenue and operating income in 2015. You didn't mention EPS. Is there a reason for that?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","EPS depends on our share repurchases, okay? That's the bridge, and I explained what are the driving factors behind our decisions in share repurchases, so, in any given time we may be slightly above or slightly below that bridge. As I said, it is too early to call next year, okay?","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Understood. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","We've covered Philippines fairly well, but I just wanted to get one more question on that about the Marlboro flavor code launch in Mindanao. Have you seen that have a big impact there? Is it helping drive share? What's your thinking about how that's positioned and how it's working so far?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Early days. The launch is both, tactical and strategic, so it's not meant yet to be expanded, so we will see how it reacts there, but that's kind of hedging also the price gaps in the Philippines.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","Thank you. That's helpful. In terms of margins or the cost structure, how different is it and what kind of impact does it add to the mix of your business?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I can't answer by heart these margins. The margins are not very different, but this is a very small volume, okay? So, I don\u2019t think that impacts our margins. Cut to skin in the Philippines, as I said by maintaining artificially low price for a period of time brands like Jackpot for example, where we have to subsidize to a large degree the excise tax and that\u2019s much more impactful and it would correct this that will swing the profitability much more than Marlboro flavor code.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","Okay. Great. Thank you. Then just looking at Indonesia in its 3Q, when the inflation pressure on the consumer was the strongest and the category growth was the weakest, you gained share sequentially and year-over-year even despite having such a premium skew to your portfolio.","Can you describe what changed in 4Q that would have gone down and what does it look like going forward? Is there some new competitive launches that are driving it or what are the big factors there?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Well, I think the important thing is the performance as I said in my remarks of Dji Sam Soe and Sampoerna A, the two hand rolled kretek brands, but cost during the middle of the year, the price points and competitive brands in the same category, have not yet crossed that point.","I don\u2019t know exactly their pricing, but logic says that during the second half of this year, they should cross that point and should help our share. Okay? For the other brands in the portfolio are doing very well. And as I also said, we are increasing the marketing support of the brands, so I'm fairly optimistic about the share situation in Indonesia.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","But isn't likely to have pressure in 1H '14 driven from those two brands until the price points on competitors cross some of the same thresholds?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I didn't hear the question?","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","You said that the competitors price points are likely to catch up crossing some of the same thresholds in the second half of this year, so is there likely still a lot of pressure in the first half? How do you see that playing out?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I don't know how competitors are pricing. I cannot predict this obviously, but Indonesia in general, the tradition is, as I explained previously that, at the beginning of the year, your price is covering the excise tax increases and then you get net pricing during the year. You always have gradual pricing in Indonesia during the year, okay?","As the year unfolds, we have our plan for pricing. I would expect, also given the excise tax and continued pressure from the clubs, other manufacturers are going to have a similar approach. So, yes, we will be probably under some pressure for the next few months, but overall we can see moderate share gains during the full year.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","Okay. That's helpful. Clove prices I know were in issue last year. There is not a whole lot of visibility on those, but it does look like they are down from the peak levels pretty nicely. How are you positioned there? Is that a tailwind in 2014?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I wouldn\u2019t say they lower in rupee terms. Clearly, the evaluation in dollar terms they have come a little bit down. Now, the purchase has happened in the market. We are quite I would say lucky this year that we had second year of a very decent cold, but if you look at the impact on us, we had a very big impact on our costs in 2012, '13 is going down and as we annualized the inventory replenishment the impact is going to be even lower in comparative terms next year, so we our other price stability and our price is going down.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","Okay. That's great. Thanks. Then just back to Japan pricing. Could you give a sense? I know you talked about how it looks like, the applications you've put in should give some net pricing. What's the split in the portfolio? Is my math about right that that would be around the 4-ish percent increase? If so, how much of that do you see maybe being at risk of trading down? If your applications are approved, what kind of net pricing do you think you might be realize?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Yes. Day one, if you do the math, it's 4%. You are right, but then way also there Ministry of Finance is looking at areas, what the end result is going to be, including share, some down trading from that portfolio. As I said previously, there will be some share movement. As I also said, we will put some additional promotional money for a period of time. Overall if these prices are accepted, we will have some net positive.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citi","My first question has to do with Indonesia. I mean, I think it seems reasonable enough to expect that, that market will decelerate a little bit further into 2014, but can you offer a little bit more detail about kind of how you are thinking about the macro landscape in that market, just to give us comfort on that plus one, given kind of the challenges you had with guidance in that market last year. Specifically, are you expecting a reduction in the subsidy for fuel, because there's some chatter about that in the market.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Okay. Look, the positives about Indonesia is it has positive demographics. Also, I think long-term account, it has a lot of potential and we have seen that there is up trading this year, last year and I expect up-trading to continue this year.","We had some particular issues. The first one is, the disappearance of the low tax tier, but in a shortcut we call the sister companies. That has a 3 billion cigarette impact on us and we have discontinued these brands actually, but other competitors are much more affected.","Clearly, it's either discontinue these brands or you take very substantial price increases, which I think is reasonable to assume it will have some impact on total market this year. Okay? This is one of the key factors why we have predicted its prediction 1% total market growth.","The other one is the devaluation of currency is bringing inflation, and many of the goods in Indonesia including fuel are important, so we are seeing some inflation happening. That\u2019s, again, unfortunately hit the low end consumers. If we see some deceleration is at the low price segment, and bigger the factor that I can describe today, but long-term as I explained, I think the country has tremendous potential.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Understood, so just to clarify, the embedded in your guidance is there no expectation for a change to fuel subsidies. It's just the inflation?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","To be honest with you, Vivien I don\u2019t take the fuel subsidies actions, because I don\u2019t know how to factor the mean, but try to bake in all this factors I described and that\u2019s the best guest we have.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Okay. That's reasonable. Yes, complicated math to be sure. Turning to Russia really quickly, you called out price elasticity is one of the factors driving the 9% to 11%. I just wanted to clarify, is it just normal price elasticity or is it a change in price elasticity in Russia, that\u2019s causing your outlook for downturn for industry volumes at the mid-point?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","I think, if I recall correctly, we took a slightly higher price elasticity given the magnitude of the increases. We need to look at the history of Russia, where with a tax plan which is very welcome, because it gives us predictability. We had three subsequent years of a substantial tax and price increases, so it's not only one year. Its three years. I think it's reasonable to assume some higher elasticity.","Now, whether 9% to 11% is the final number we'll see as the quarters unfold, okay? I want to remind you two things. First, that this is the last year of large tax increases and we should be looking at a better tax environment, although continuously predictable as of 2015 and beyond. Secondly, despite this projected quite large volume decline, we also, as I said in my remarks, foresee a pretty substantially profitability growth in Russia due to margin improvement.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Understood. A follow-up on Russia. Embedded in that outlook are you seeing any negative impact to volumes from the implementation of wave one of the indoor smoking bans in that market?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Marginally, it's always the case. We have put this in our guidance, obviously, okay? We also have, as I explained previously, this year the disappearance of kiosks. Although it's difficult to say that this will have an impact on total consumption, we have to see also what it really does in terms of impact on consumers, but always it's part of our estimate.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Wonderful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","Good afternoon, guys. Andr\u00e9, question I guess going back to like the long-term targets in 2015 and I guess even beyond that. In November, you laid out the potential adult user base and margin potential for reduced risk product. When thinking about your growth targets for OCI, so I guess EPS will be impacted by FX, but is getting back to the target growth rate contingent upon the success of reduced risk product or is that incremental?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","If we look at 2015, clearly a contribution of reduced risk products is rather de minimis and we will be in investment mode, because of the expansion or introduction of reduced risk products for the next two, three years, okay? Reality is, for the time being the investment is going against our numbers, so at least once we come even and breakeven on this, the rest is incremental. For the time being, we are negative on reinvestment you appreciate that.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","You feel still comfortable about your targets in '15 and '16?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","","Yes.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","Got it. I would leave it there, guys.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2011 full year and fourth quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. ","During our call this afternoon, we'll be talking about results for the full year or fourth quarter 2011 and comparing them with the same period in 2010, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions, which for the purposes of this presentation also includes our business combination with Fortune Tobacco Corporation in the Philippines. ","Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating company's income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing how we made adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs. Free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Louis Camilleri, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Hermann Waldemer, Chief Financial Officer, who will join Louis for the question-and-answer period. ","Louis?","Louis C. Camilleri","Thank you, Nick. And good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. 2011 was a superb year for Philip Morris International. We returned to organic volume growth, thanks notably to our strong performance in Indonesia and in Japan, where we benefited from our excellent execution in response to the tragic events there last March.","We achieved global share growth for the fourth consecutive year, driven by our superior brand portfolio. Our solid volume performance, strong pricing and significant productivity savings led to record profitability. Finally and perhaps most importantly, we continued to generate strong cash flow, which enabled us to provide generous returns to our shareholders.","In the fourth quarter of 2011, we increased net revenues and adjusted operating company's income or OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, by 8.2% and 7% respectively and grew our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding currency, by 13.4%. The growth in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was driven by higher pricing, particularly in the EEMA and EU regions and favorable volume mix, principally in Asia, partly offset by higher costs reflecting increased marketing investment in several important markets, such as Germany, Japan and Russia.","In the Asia region, adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, was up by an impressive 22.6% in the quarter, driven by strong growth in Australia, Indonesia, Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and by a robust 10.5% on the same basis in the EEMA region. These increases more than compensated for declines in our 2 other regions. In the EU region, adjusted OCI, excluding currency, was down 4.3%, adversely impacted by unfavorable volume mix, notably in Italy and Spain.","In addition, we increased our marketing investments substantially in the quarter behind a new Marlboro marketing campaign in Germany, Marlboro Beyond capsule product launches in France and Switzerland and the launch of Marlboro Core Flavor in Spain. In the Latin America and Canada region, unfavorable volume mix primarily volume in Mexico and higher expenditures contributed to a 6.3% decline in the quarter in adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions. On a full year basis, net revenues and adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, rose by 9.2% and 14% respectively and the growth of our adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding currency was an outstanding 21.2%.  ","In recent months the euro has weakened, mainly due to the sovereign debt issues in Europe and several emerging market currencies have also depreciated against the U.S. dollar. At prevailing exchange rates, we forecast a currency headwind of approximately $0.10 per share this year with the largest impact expected to come in the second and third quarters. I would like to stress that this would simply bring us back about halfway to the currency levels generally prevalent in 2010 as we benefited from a $0.19 per share currency favorability in 2011.","We have excellent business momentum going into 2012, which will enable us to fully compensate for the earnings per share hurdle of $0.10 related to the exceptional circumstances in Japan in 2011.  The comparison for Japan will, of course, be especially difficult in the second quarter of this year. For the full year 2012, we are forecasting reported diluted earnings per share guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be in the range of $5.25 to $5.35 compared to $4.85 in 2011.  Excluding the currency headwind, this new guidance range represents a growth rate of approximately 10% to 12% compared to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.88 in 2011. Thus, I am delighted to reconfirm that we expect to achieve results in 2012 that will again meet our mid- to long-term currency-neutral annual growth targets, this despite the Japan hurdle I just mentioned.","Our strong business results have generated tremendous and growing amounts of cash. Our free cash flow has grown at a double-digit compound annual growth rate since 2008 to reach $9.6 billion in 2011, despite sizable contributions of more than $500 million into our main employee pension funds last year. We expect continued cash flow growth in the years ahead, which will enable us to provide our shareholders with generous returns. We initiated our current $12 billion 3-year share repurchase program in May 2010. At the end of 2011, we had $3.6 billion left under this authorization and we expect to complete our current program well ahead of schedule. We plan to spend $6 billion in total on share repurchases during this year. ","We remain confident in our future as the key drivers of our strong 2011 performance are expected to remain in place in 2012. These are a manageable excise tax environment, stable industry volume trends, our superior brand portfolio, our market share growth, a favorable pricing environment, limited input cost increases and strong productivity gains. The threat of disruptive excise taxes has always been a concern. However, most governments appear to have understood that large disruptive excise tax increases usually do not generate the targeted increase in government revenues nor are they sustainable. Consequently, there have been no excise tax increases implemented or announced so far this year that we would deem to be extreme in any of our key markets, despite large government budget deficits in numerous countries. On the contrary, we are witnessing a more reasonable approach both in terms of incidents and the structure of excise taxes, most notably in the European Union, as governments are keen to secure sustainable revenue streams from tobacco taxation. Several countries in Europe are most likely to increase general VAT rates this year. But overall, we believe that such increases should be manageable.","We anticipate that cigarette industry volume trends will remain similar to those prevalent last year. We see further volume growth opportunities in non-OECD markets where the adult smoking population is expanding and where the economy is vibrant, most notably in Asia and the Middle East.  The industry volume decline in the largest OECD markets and in Eastern Europe is expected to be moderate. The one area of significant concern remains Southern Europe, where unemployment remains notoriously high and is regretfully still rising. We expect PMI's organic cigarette volume performance in 2012 to be relatively flat despite the hurdle we face in Japan. This is better than the 5-year total industry volume trend, excluding China, that we forecast in November last year.","Our superior geographic footprint and brand portfolio are driving our share growth momentum. We expect to outperform the industry again in 2012. In 2011, we gained 1.2 share points in our top 30 OCI markets to reach a level of 36.3%. We generated particularly strong market share gains in OECD markets, driven by Germany, Japan, Korea and Turkey and increased market shares in a number of important non-OECD markets, such as Indonesia and Russia.","Every single one of our top 10 brands realized volume gains in 2011, whether sold in the premium, mid- or low-priced segments or whether international or local. The strength of our portfolio is underscored by the fact that these top 10 brands accounted for approximately 75% of our worldwide volume last year. Marlboro continues to steadily gain market share on a global basis driven by its strong performance in Asia and the EEMA region, which has more than offset the pressure on the premium segment in Western Europe.  This growth has been propelled by the new architecture, the launch of consumer-relevant line extensions and enhanced consumer engagement. ","Parliament, which has a luxury positioning and is sold at an above-premium price, performed exceptionally well with an increase in shipment volume of 12.1% last year and 18.7% in the fourth quarter alone. In 2011, Parliament share grew in its 5 major markets of Kazakhstan, Korea, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine. L&M, our second-largest brand, grew by 1.7% to reach 90 billion units in 2011. This was achieved through continued market share gains in the European Union region, most notably in Germany, where the brand grew by 1.1 share points to reach a market share of 10.4%.  Importantly, as the year unfolded, we were able to stabilize the brand's share in the EEMA region and particularly in Russia, where it has been under pressure for the past few years.","Overall, we achieved a favorable volume\/mix variance of $422 million in 2011. This represents an improvement of $1.1 billion compared to 2010. In 2011, our pricing variance reached $1.9 billion, half of which came from the Asia region, well above the $1.6 billion average achieved over the previous 3 years. The favorable pricing environment is expected to continue to be a key driver of our growth in 2012. Since the beginning of the year, we have announced or implemented price increases, notably in Germany, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia and more recently in Korea. In fact, we have already in place price increases which cumulatively account for some 70% of the pricing variance included in our 2012 earnings per share guidance.","Adjusted OCI margins improved further in 2011 to reach 44.2%, excluding currency and acquisitions, driven by higher prices, the positive impact of geographic mix, particularly from Japan, and productivity savings, which surpassed our $250 million target. At the same time, we made significant investments in business infrastructure in Russia, as well as in our brands in Japan and other markets, notably behind the successful launch of consumer-relevant line extensions.  ","Going forward, we forecast moderate increases in tobacco leaf prices and direct material costs, broadly in line with inflation. With the exception of higher costs relating to the imposition of reduced cigarette ignition propensity or RCIP paper in Europe, we are targeting a further $300 million in pretax productivity savings in 2012, predominantly derived from manufacturing and supply chain initiatives.","We continue to transform a considerably higher proportion of our growing net revenues into free cash flow than our consumer products and tobacco industry peers. Our strong and growing cash flow fuels an attractive dividend and share repurchase program. We've increased our dividend by 67.4% since 2008 and repurchased nearly 20% of our shares outstanding at the time of the spin. In 2011, we outperformed every company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average in terms of shareholder returns and share price appreciation, with gains of 39.8% and 34.1% respectively. Over the period of March 28, 2008 through the end of December 2011, we have returned approximately $37 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases or nearly 30% of our current market capitalization. While the economic environment, particularly in Southern Europe, remains fragile and continued currency volatility is an obvious concern, we remain optimistic that our growth prospects are sound despite the comparison to what was a banner year for Philip Morris International.","Thank you for your attention. Hermann and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instruction] Our first question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I wanted to ask you about 2 markets, one is Japan and then Russia. Let me start with Japan. Can you talk to us how you envision the 28.2% share entering the year, how you see that evolving throughout 2012. What type of impact, if any, do you think you'll see from JT's plethora of pending product launches? And also as your share has gone up, have you been able to capture a greater share of convenient store shelf space?","Louis C. Camilleri","Well, our ambition is to continue to grow our share, David. In January, our share was 28.3%, fourth quarter was 28.2%. We also have a plethora of new products coming up. So in terms of share, our ambition certainly is to continue to grow share in this important market. And I think we have a number of exciting programs there. I think also in terms of the macro picture, the markets performed much more strongly than we had originally anticipated at this time last year. Ultimately, volume was only down about 10.5% last year. And you may recall that our concern was it would be down about double that. So it's not just a share story, it's also volume story. And I think in terms of our presence in convenience vending, generally in terms of consumer engagement and trade engagement, we are very competitive. And as I said in my remarks, we have increased our spending in Japan.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then in Russia, Louis, can you speak to the execution plan behind Marlboro? How long do you think it's really going to take to have a meaningful increase in market share? And have you done anything in test markets or in smaller cities that has some promising indications?","Louis C. Camilleri","You're right to point out that Marlboro in Russia has been an issue for us, and we've clearly devoted a lot of resources to try and find a solution for Marlboro in Russia. We have beefed up our organization considerably. And the good news is that last year, starting last summer, we did one main test in the city particularly focused on Russia and Marlboro's potential there, and I must say the results of all the activities that we did in that city in Russia provided excellent results and really moved the needle quite considerably in terms of Marlboro. It also pointed out some of Marlboro's weaknesses to us. But I would say that probably for PMI, that market test was not only important for Russia, but a lot of the learnings of what we did there would be applied elsewhere in the world. But going back to Russia, what we did, it was in Yekaterinburg, you will see that there will be expansion this year, and we anticipate more spending in Russia. Marlboro's been losing share for some time now. I think we now have to focus on its issues. We know what to do. I'm hopeful that we can grow share. Whether it will be a significant brand will take quite a lot of time, David.","Operator","Your next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Louis, so if I just take your volume guidance for 2012 sort of flat, even if you're lapping the Japan impact, so that implies if you take Japan out, you're probably looking for an acceleration in terms of other markets outside of Japan. So I'm just curious if you can just walk through where do you feel confidence that the volume can actually accelerate. Can Indonesia continue to grow at this 20% rate?","Louis C. Camilleri","No, I don't think Indonesia is going to be growing at 20% volume rate. I think it's generally strength across-the-board, Judy. If I look at our share performance in the fourth quarter, and I'm talking just share here, in the vast majority of markets, we did better than the full year, so it shows that we have momentum. I think the big difference is that we anticipate that volume in the EU will be better than it was in 2011 because a lot of the issues are potentially behind us. Southern Europe remains a concern, but we still believe that we can do better in the EU than we did in 2011. Asia and EEMA will continue to propel our growth and we also believe that there are growth prospects in Latin America and Canada because share performance in Latin America has actually been quite spectacular. But obviously Mexico was a big issue in 2011 with a significant decrease in consumption, which affected the whole region's performance. And as you know, there's no tax increase in Mexico this year. So hopefully, we're looking a much better comparison than we did in 2011.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just going back to Japan, Louis, I guess, one downside of perhaps the 2011 success in Japan is Japan is now a much bigger portion of your overall profit, as well as the overall Asia profit. And it is one market where pricing freedom is limited. So can you help us understand how you grow profit in that market without the pricing freedom? And do you need to see acceleration in profit of other Asian markets to really drive continuous healthy profit growth in the Asia region?","Louis C. Camilleri","Well, it's a downside I can actually live with. But I would say that you're right, Japan is obviously a significant profit center. I think in terms of growth going forward, we had proven that, in fact, we had probably cracked the pricing freedom issue back in 2010. Now clearly, JT is the leader there. You know that the government is targeting reducing their stake in the company. And from everything I read, JT is focused on becoming much more shareholder-friendly in terms of dividend, share repurchases, et cetera. So I think pricing freedom per se is likely to get better over time. This year, we do not anticipate any tax increases. And we think we have significant share growth potential in that market. Going to the rest of Asia, we believe that Asia will continue to be the growth engine of this company, and that there is still a lot to accomplish in our existing markets, but also in virgin territories. So yes, the rest of Asia will certainly grow faster than Japan, but I wouldn't write off Japan at all, Judy. I should add that we anticipate that this year, partially because of the strength of the yen but despite the huge hurdle we face, we anticipate that our income in Japan will be higher than it was in 2011.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On a constant currency basis.","Louis C. Camilleri","No, I said partially...","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","With the yen. Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","I wanted to circle back on some of the markets. In particular, given your comments on the outlook for Asia, I was wondering if you could update us on the Philippines business and where things are at both in terms of the cost saves, but more importantly the outlook for that business as now it has been a while with PMI really in control of that operation.","Louis C. Camilleri","We're delighted with the business combination in the Philippines. Everything is going according to plan and, in fact, beyond plan. Income is up significantly, driven by both pricing, share growth as well as cost saves. We're ahead of our target in terms of cost saves. And there is more to come this year. We've gained share, the market was down last year because of the price increases and the tax increase in early 2011. In 2012, there's no tax per se. Share growth continues, so the outlook in the Philippines is really quite excellent. We're now focused on merging our distribution arms. And that, I think, will give us even more leverage with the trade and really be able to capitalize on the entire brand portfolio. Does that answer your question, Erik?","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then with respect to Plain Packaging, I was wondering if you can update us on where we're at in that process. Obviously, the implementation is in December 2012, and I believe we can expect a hearing in April. So I was curious both in terms of what it looks like in the Australian High Court challenge, but then also the BIT challenge and where things stand with the WTO.","Louis C. Camilleri","Okay, I'll try to give you a brief summary. You may have read that the government has filed its defense in the High Court a couple of days ago, I believe. And there is a hearing on procedural matters, I believe, on February 23, and we'll take it from there. One of the focus areas will be on the facts behind the claim in terms of we believe that there's been an acquisition of property and the government does not believe that there's been an acquisition of property. And the court will have to decide what are the relevant facts related to that specific legal claim, and if there's disagreement on those facts, that may delay the whole process. If there's agreements, there's likely to be a decision in late summer or the fall. But from everything we see, it seems that there may be significant disagreement on the factual components of the claim. On the BIT claim, where we stand is that both parties have chosen the arbitrators that represent them. And those 2 now are scheduled to choose the third one. So that will take a little while. And really, the case won't really start until this summer. But it's likely to be a 2-year process at best. And in terms of the WTO, there's not much to report other than we are aware that a number of countries have expressed a strong desire to make a claim against Australia to the WTO. So we're really in the early days of all the litigation efforts, the 3 key efforts, but we remain vigorous in our intent to pursue our rights vis-\u00e0-vis Australia.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","And if I could follow up on that briefly, is it fair to think that other countries' considerations of Plain Packaging is likely to be that any efforts toward moving into a plain packaging environment are likely to be on hold, given the Australian litigation? Is that a fair view from your perspective?","Louis C. Camilleri","I'm not sure, Erik. Clearly, they're all watching Australia with a close eye. The legal situation changes depending on the geographies. I think that there are a number of countries that are looking at it very seriously, New Zealand is one. The U.K. is starting a consultation phase. But I think that in most instances, people will realize that Plain Packaging does not achieve the objectives that those acts would hopefully entail. In fact, there are such huge unintended consequences that I think it would be detrimental to public health. And it certainly will not reduce consumption of cigarettes, which is the main aim here.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions for you. Early in your remarks, Louis, you commented on a $0.10 hurdle from Japan. I just want to understand that figure because I think you were running at a $0.15 benefit. Did I understand that correctly? Or what's the difference in the calculation there?","Louis C. Camilleri","What we've said is if you look at 2011, the increment of the special situation in Japan, the $0.15 was through the third quarter. For the full year, it's $0.18, Chris. That was the impact on 2011. If you now look forward to 2012, we clearly have gained share and we've retained that share. So that's in the base, which is this 28.2%. Hence, the -- really which happened in the second quarter of last year where the share was significantly higher than that, that actually is the way we view the hurdle for 2012. And therefore, it's a different number and that number is $0.10.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. The other question I had for you is just in relation to Marlboro. Obviously, the brand did remarkably well in 2011. Is part of your volume growth plans -- I'm sure you don't want to get too detailed on these plans, but do you expect Marlboro growth? And I guess I can go a step further than that. I was just curious that that's a brand you've invested pretty heavily in with new products and promotional campaigns. You labeled some of those for some of the Western European markets in your remarks. Do you have enough sort of new activity there? Do you think that the Marlboro brand could kind of keep up with the overall company's volume growth in 2012?","Louis C. Camilleri","I would certainly hope so, yes. And we still anticipate a number of programs behind Marlboro. It has suffered in a few markets. But even if you take the European Union and you separate the south versus the north, the north has done much better. And we're confident that we can still improve that situation. In the south, essentially Marlboro stands alone in the premium segment, everybody has vacated that segment. And we had programs in place in terms of lathering the brand through the Core Flavor extensions, the Pocket Pack. And that seems to have been quite successful. If you take Greece, Marlboro share is actually up in Greece, which is quite a spectacular performance. So we'll see as things unfold. But clearly, our ambition is to ensure that Marlboro continues to grow and actually hopefully outpaces the total volume growth of the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","My first question is on Parliament, your Parliament brand, which as you mentioned has been generating faster growth and at the above-premium price point. So could you talk a little bit more about why you think this is occurring? Is it driven by improving economic trends in key markets? Or have you been increasing marketing spend behind the brand? And then also, how sustainable is this growth for Parliament? And are there further opportunities to extend the brand into other markets?","Louis C. Camilleri","Well clearly, because it's a luxury brand, Bonnie, it is less sensitive to price than a brand such as Marlboro. And it has proven to be extremely resilient. There has been a lot of innovation behind Parliament, so far extremely successful. It's a very special brand. Its recessed filter has been copied by others in a number of markets, Turkey, in particular. But even then Parliament continues to grow. So it has a good presence in a luxury segment that is less prone to down trading and we're seeing the results, which are pretty spectacular. I don't know what else I could add.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","No, that sounds good. And then I have another question in terms of your business in Asia. And after modeling it out, it's clear to me that your top line market should continue to drive the bulk of the profitability in the region in the next 3 years, particularly Indonesia. But I'd like to hear from you how you think about sort of the mix of the countries within your Asian region and how that might evolve and specifically, in regards to your investment cycle and infrastructure build in some of the other growing markets such as Thailand, Vietnam, India, sort of where you're at with some of those maybe smaller markets for you at this point.","Louis C. Camilleri","Okay, let me attempt. We talked about Japan earlier, and I think Japan will always remain a very important market for Asia. Korea, we feel very good about Korea in terms of its share growth. We just took a price increase, and Korea will continue, in our mind, to show long-term growth. Our share may suffer a bit because KT&G has not increased its prices. But within the portfolio, we feel very good about our business in Korea. Indonesia, I believe, will continue to be the growth driver in Asia for many, many, many years. Philippines, we mentioned earlier. I think Philippines has the potential to be a top 5 income market for the whole of PMI within the next 7 to 8 years. And then there are all the other markets that you mentioned where we are seeing growth. I mean, what was phenomenal in Asia is that Marlboro gained share in every single market in Asia last year. And in terms of share, we gained share in every market, with the exception of Pakistan. There are territories such as Vietnam which I think will be a market for the future, which we are doing well in and I hope we will continue to do well. And then of course there's China, Bonnie. And I would hope within the time frame that you're talking about, somehow we will have a presence in China, which completely changes everything in terms of Asia because there would be a paradigm shift.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Absolutely. That's helpful. And I just sort of want to confirm then some of the infrastructure build in some of those markets where you don't necessarily have a huge presence at this point, you've invested, you're ready.","Louis C. Camilleri","We are ready. And we have invested in terms of resources and we continue to do so and to ensure that we have the appropriate talent as well in all these markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the marketing, admin and research. So on a total company level, I guess it was up about 100 basis points. And you've certainly been clear about the specific market investments you guys have made, an infrastructure build in Russia. But that 100 basis points on a total company basis is the largest we've seen since '09. So I was just wondering if you can kind of put the magnitude of that increase in context. Is it timing of a bunch of different things you're doing at once? Is it a reflection of your success so far and just the ability to spend back, having a couple of little fires in the Marlboro brand around the portfolio, I guess? But can you just put that increase in context?","Louis C. Camilleri","I think you sort of covered it all in your question. It's a combination of everything you just said. We have a number of programs in place. And we have exciting programs that we're now implementing and we're putting money behind it across numerous markets. I've sort of highlighted the key ones. Germany is the first market we've used the new Marlboro campaign, which we started in the fourth quarter. And we're very hopeful that, that will move the needle in terms of Marlboro in Germany. And clearly, that campaign will be expanded elsewhere and there's a lot of excitement generated by that campaign. And we continue to build on the Marlboro architecture in the line extensions, and I've mentioned a few examples in the European Union. But if you take Asia, some of the line extensions have been frankly quite spectacular. Ice Blast in Japan has been a phenomenal success. So there's a lot of excitement behind Marlboro, and we're putting the money behind it. But it's not just Marlboro, it's Parliament, it's L&M and it's Chesterfield, where a lot of work has been done in terms of brand portfolio, the actual brands themselves, the campaigns, the consumer engagement activities. It really is all coming together.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","That's helpful. And I guess, as a follow-up, would you expect these levels of spending to be sustained? I guess is there any upfront nature of this spending? Or it's just something you'd expect to continue? And I guess, what do you think of the timing of the payback of these investments, understanding, of course, there are different natures of these? If you could just kind of try to pull it together, I'd appreciate it.","Louis C. Camilleri","We anticipate in 2012 that we will actually increase our marketing spend and investments. And the beauty of our margins is that the returns are pretty rapid.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I just wanted to dig into India a little bit. I know it's small and far longer-term opportunity, but how has the response to Marlboro been since you sort of retriggered the business there? What's the consumer and retailer, customer response been so far?","Louis C. Camilleri","You're right, it's still small. We're really only active in 3 cities today. And the reaction both from the trade and the consumer in those 3 cities is actually excellent. Marlboro continues to grow its volume every month and we're pretty excited about Marlboro's prospects. And I think we would like to get a more solid footing in those 3 cities before we start expanding. So it'll be a slow process. We face a formidable competitor that clearly is not going to give us an easy ride. We're fully aware of that. And I must say that the progress I've seen in Marlboro in India and specifically in those 3 cities is very, very promising.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Well, that's great. And then also just back to the Philippines. I know you said that the pricing and cost savings were drivers. What split was that? Was one more important than the other? And what kind of sustainability to the pricing do you see there?","Louis C. Camilleri","I wouldn't go into the actual drivers. But yes, we see pricing opportunities in the Philippines over the long-term as being quite significant. Much will, of course, depend on what happens to excise taxes. And there has been talk of a reform of excise taxes, we'll see. So far, there have been debates in committees, but nothing concrete as of yet. And it seems to be that at least for the foreseeable future, the current excise tax structure will remain in place.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And then lastly on Indonesia, it looks like there's some excise tax increases there. Do you see any problem covering those with pricing or more than covering them? What kind of pacing do you see that taking throughout the year?","Louis C. Camilleri","No, I feel quite confident that over time we can handle the excise tax increases that were implemented in Indonesia. As has been the case in the past, they were not excessive increases and they're quite manageable. And we believe that Indonesia will continue to rocket ahead in terms of both volume and income.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rogerio Fujimori of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Could you talk a bit about illicit trade trends in some of your key markets? You flagged Spain on the negative side and Canada on the positive side in 2011. So I'm just wondering if these trends -- you see these trends continuing. Or are illicit trade levels stabilizing in those markets?","Louis C. Camilleri","Illicit trade continues to be a huge problem. It has expanded quite significantly in a number of markets. And yes, you mentioned Spain. But illicit trade is increasing not only in Spain but in Greece, in Italy, in Germany, in Mexico quite dramatically, and remains a big issue in numerous Asian markets. So it's a plague. And we're doing everything to fight it. And hopefully, we can have more success going forward. It's a big problem, but it's also potentially an opportunity because you would hope that at one point those volumes will return to legitimate trade. And I think governments are more and more focused on ensuring that they don't open the door to further illicit trade by huge tax increases. But it remains a big issue, Rogerio. And we've made progress. I think if the world could adopt the industry's tracking and tracing system, it would help considerably. The advent of what are called illicit whites has become a huge issue, and we need to tackle the source of those products.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just one quick question about Russia; the Russian consumer, actually. Is the price elasticity after the latest increase and also the pace of up trading playing out as you expected?","Louis C. Camilleri","Pretty well, yes. I mean, the Russian market in total is down. But in terms of the trends, the segment trends, they are showing signs of improvement. So it's looking quite good. And I think there is considerable consumer confidence in Russia.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you could help me with a little more detail in terms of your outlook for the EU market in 2012. You touched a little bit on volume. So what's your confidence in pricing and growing OCI? And what are inventory levels like?","Louis C. Camilleri","Nothing really to report on inventory levels. We are hopeful that we can return to constant currency income growth in EU. Last year it was down, in part driven -- in large part driven by Spain. I think Spain alone, if I recall, was close to 3 percentage points of growth or lack of growth in EU. And our hope is that we can grow income in EU, which wasn't the case last year, Ann.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then in terms of any potential markets requiring the use of LIP, do you anticipate any markets over the next several years converting to the required use of LIP?","Louis C. Camilleri","Well, the whole EU is on it now, which clearly is a cost hurdle this year or at least for 3 quarters. Others have looked at it. Nothing seems to be on the horizon yet. But I would anticipate that over time, most of the world would probably go in that direction, Ann, [indiscernible] although it doesn't make much sense.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Wickham of Oriel Securities.","Christopher Wickham - Oriel Securities Ltd., Research Division","Just going back on Rogerio's point, I mean, you do read increasingly that people are accusing the tobacco industry of using illicit trade as a tool really to get back at governments or to some extent to have it their way on taxes and on communication. I mean, do you feel that the approach to illicit trade has been mishandled? And can you think of ways in which it could be handled better?","Louis C. Camilleri","I think that clearly not enough has been done in terms of fighting illicit trade. I think the reference you made is actually being made less and less because the fact is law enforcements, authorities throughout the world recognize the role that the legitimate industry is having in fighting illicit trade. The bulk of illicit trade today is counterfeit products and illicit whites, by far the bulk of the illicit trade. And I think industry, government stakeholders, as well as consumers need to combine forces to fight this plague. It's been successful in a number of places, Canada was mentioned earlier. Romania was a good example, where illicit trade has been forcefully addressed and has declined quite significantly. It's still there, double-digit, but it's come down by some 40%. So it can be done, but it requires cooperation from everybody. And regretfully, there is so much money involved in illicit trade that at times it's difficult to get everybody's cooperation. But we are very focused on that and, in fact, intend to invest more behind the fight against illicit trade.","Operator","Our final question is a follow-up from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","With respect to another market where there's meaningful illicit, Brazil has a large tax increase coming in May, also with a minimum retail price implementation. What's the Philip Morris view on that? Is that increase going to be disruptive? And is PMI optimistic about improvements in the illicit versus legal volume mix in Brazil post the change in the law?","Louis C. Camilleri","You would hope that if the minimum price is actually adhered to, that clearly would help. Illicit trade in Brazil is not a new problem; it's been 30% of consumption for as long as I can remember. And it's basically 2 sources, one is Paraguay and the other is local manufacturers. I think the Brazilian government has focused more and more on the local manufacturers with some success. But it is an issue. I think that, as you know, the new tax reform is over a 3-year period. There will ultimately be one uniform tax rate applied to all cigarettes. I think that is a good thing. It may cause some short-term disruptions. But in terms of the longer-term prospects for that market, I think the government has made the wise and right move.","Operator","Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2017 second quarter results and you may access the release on www.pmi.com, or the PMI Investor Relations app.","During our call today, please note the following unless otherwise stated. First, we will be talking about results for the second quarter of 2017 and comparing them to the same period in 2016. Second, all references to total industry, PMI volume and PMI market share performance reflect cigarettes and PMI's heated tobacco units for those markets that have commercial sales of IQOS.","A glossary of terms, adjustments, and other calculations, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.","Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products that present, are likely to present, or have the potential to present less risk of harm to smokers who switch to these products versus continued smoking.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results, and I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We are pleased by our performance in the second quarter, notably reflecting strong currency neutral financial results, including growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8.7%, sequential improvement in our total shipment volume declined compared to the first quarter, and market share growth for Marlboro across a broad range of geographies and continued positive momentum for IQOS, notably in Japan, but also across other launch markets.","As announced this morning, we are revising for currency only our 2017 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to a range of $4.78 to $4.93. Our guidance now includes approximately $0.14 of unfavorable currency. Excluding currency and the favorable $0.04 tax item recorded in the first quarter, our guidance continues to represent the growth of approximately 9% to 12%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","As a reminder, we expect higher currency neutral growth in the second half of 2017, mainly reflecting increased heated tobacco unit shipment volume, partly offset by continued investment behind the commercialization of IQOS.","The $0.06 increase in the unfavorable currency impacting on our guidance, as compared to our previous guidance on April 20, is due principally to the depreciation of the Japanese Yen and Russian Ruble versus the U.S. Dollar. Please note that the currency impact of the Yen depreciation relates to the unhedged portion of our 2017 forecast sales to Japan and is amplified by the strong performance of IQOS.","Let me now take you through our second-quarter results in more detail, beginning with our total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume, which declined by 5.0%. The decline was due mainly to lower cigarette industry volume in the Asia and EEMA regions. In Asia, this notably reflected a challenging consumer-spending environment in Indonesia, as well as ongoing declines of low-margin volumes in Pakistan and the Philippines.","In EEMA, this mainly reflected the impact of excise tax-driven price increases in Russia and an increase in illicit trade in Turkey. The decline was also due to lower volume in Saudi Arabia related to the introduction in June of an excise tax that resulted in the doubling of retail selling prices. In the case of Marlboro, the retail price increased by SAR 12 to reach SAR 24, or approximately $6.40 per pack.","The cigarette volume decline was partly offset by the strong growth of our heated tobacco products principally in Japan, which increased by 5.2 billion units to reach 6.4 billion units in the quarter.","As expected, we recorded a sequential improvement in our total volume decline during the second quarter, driven by favorable evolutions compared to the first quarter in three of our four Regions EU, EEMA, and Latin America & Canada. Excluding the negative impact on our volume performance of industry-wide trade inventory movements principally in Indonesia and Pakistan, the Asia Region would also have recorded a favorable evolution.","For the full-year, we continue to anticipate a total shipment volume decline of 3% to 4%, broadly in line with last year. This reflects a further expected sequential improvement in the third and fourth quarters, notably driven by the Asia Region with higher RRP volume and improved cigarette volume in markets such as Indonesia, Pakistan, and the Philippines.","In Pakistan specifically, we expect the recent fiscal restructuring, which introduced a new excise tax tier for lower-priced products, to ease the pressure on cigarette industry volume from illicit trade over the balance of the year.","We recorded strong currency-neutral results in the second quarter. Net revenues increased by 7%, driven by higher heated tobacco unit and IQOS device sales, notably in Japan, as well as favorable pricing.","Adjusted OCI increased by 5.9%, primarily reflecting the impact of higher net revenues, partly offset by increased investments supporting the commercialization of IQOS, notably in the EU Region. Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 8.7%.","Net revenues for our RRP portfolio reached $615 million or 8.9% of total net revenues, in the second quarter, continuing the strong sequential growth trend. As we have noted previously, a portion of our RRP net revenues are from IQOS devices, which yield a negative margin due to introductory discounts offered in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching.","For reference, IQOS devices contributed approximately 22% of our RRP net revenues in 2016. Underpinned by the strong growth outlook for RRPs, we now anticipate total currency-neutral net revenue growth above 7% this year.","We recorded a pricing variance of $367 million in the second quarter, supported by all Regions. Our year-to-date June pricing variance of $775 million represents 6.1% of first half 2016 net revenues, this is despite no net pricing in Russia, which I will discuss in more detail shortly.","Turning to market share, we recorded strong sequential growth in the second quarter, with our total international share, excluding China and the U.S., up by 80 basis points to 27.6%. This growth was driven by both our cigarette and heated tobacco portfolios. Within the cigarette category, Marlboro's international share increased sequentially by 10 basis points to 9.6%.","I will now discuss a few of our key geographies, beginning with the EU Region. Total industry volume in the second quarter declined by 1%, with sequential improvement compared to the first quarter that included a higher recovery from illicit trade in Poland and a lower impact from the 10s pack ban in Italy. June year-to-date industry volume declined by 1.8%, slightly better than our full-year decline forecast of 2% to 3%.","Our Regional market share was down by 20 basis points in the quarter mainly due to Germany, Italy, and Spain, partly offset by France and Poland. In Germany, the lower share largely reflected the combined impact of price increases in March this year, which for reference saw the per pack price of Marlboro and L&M increased by \u20ac0.30 to \u20ac6.30 and \u20ac5.90, respectively, as well as the later timing of competitors' price increases.","In Italy and Spain, the lower shares reflected a continuation of the pressures related to Marlboro price points discussed last quarter, though it is worth highlighting that our shares for Marlboro in these markets increased by 40 and 20 basis points respectively, versus the first quarter.","Regional adjusted OCI in the quarter declined by 3.7%, excluding currency, primarily reflecting higher investments behind the commercialization of IQOS. These investments are supporting the encouraging market and off take share trends in our launch markets, which I will cover later in the presentation.","Moving to Russia, total industry volume declined by 6.2% in the quarter due primarily to the impact of excise tax-driven price increases. For the full year, we continue to expect a decline in the range of 5% to 6%. Our May quarter-to-date cigarette share increased slightly versus the same period last year, and continued the fairly stable sequential share performance of the past four quarters.","Recently launched Philip Morris continues to grow share, reflecting the successful morphing of Optima and Apollo Soyuz, as well as adult smoker down trading in the market. While the industry volume decline and market share trends have been in line with expectations, our price realization is lower than anticipated due to increased competitive pricing. This is putting pressure on our ability to grow profitability in the market.","In the Philippines, higher pricing and favorable portfolio mix, reflecting the strong performance of Marlboro, drove another quarter of profitability growth. While our cigarette share declined in the quarter, Marlboro's share increased by 3.8 points, driven by in-switching from lower-priced brands. Importantly, we are beginning to see a stabilization in our cigarette share, which increased by 20 basis points sequentially versus the first quarter.","The cigarette industry volume decline rate moderated sequentially with a decline of 5.7% in the second quarter following a 15.3% decline in the prior quarter. As we look toward the balance of the year, we are encouraged by the combination of recent competitor price increases and lower competitor discounting at the bottom of the market. This has led to a reduction in the price gaps between our portfolio, notably Fortune, and lower-priced competitor brands, enhancing the overall competitiveness of our portfolio particularly in the low and super-low price segments.","In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume in the second quarter was adversely impacted by three main factors: a challenging comparison, due largely to inventory movements mainly associated with the timing of Ramadan; above inflation tax-driven retail price increases; and the effect of higher utility prices on consumer spending. We now anticipate a decline of around 3% this year.","Our cigarette market share declined by 60 basis points in the quarter, due mainly to the soft performance of our hand-rolled kretek portfolio. The decline was partly offset by Marlboro, reflecting the growth of Marlboro Filter Black in the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment, and the strong early performance of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild, a lighter-tasting machine-made kretek product that we launched in May. These two offerings are driving our growth in the overall machine-made kretek segment, the largest and fastest-growing product segment industry-wide.","In Japan, the spectacular growth of HeatSticks continues to drive our results. The brand's shipments in the second quarter increased by 37% on a sequential basis to reach 5.7 billion units, accounting for over 40% of our total shipments in Japan. Total market share increased by 4.5 points to 32%, with HeatSticks up by 7.8 points to 10.0%.","On a sequential basis, HeatSticks grew by an impressive 2.9 points versus last quarter. During the second quarter, we expanded the availability of two new HeatSticks variants, in the smooth taste and differentiated menthol taste segments respectively, and both are performing very well.","Total industry volume declined by 3.2% excluding inventory movements, consistent with the secular decline rate for cigarettes prior to the introduction of IQOS.","The strong performance of IQOS in Japan is further evidenced by our retail offtake shares, as seen on the slide. HeatSticks closed the quarter with a weekly offtake share of 12.7% nationally, up by 3.1 points versus the last week of the first quarter. This growth was achieved despite a continued cap on the number of IQOS devices supplied to the market, as well as the increasing presence of competitors' products in select geographies.","Turning to the commercialization of IQOS more broadly, we have now launched IQOS in key cities in 27 markets globally, following city launches in Korea in May and the Czech Republic earlier this month. We are particularly pleased with the early performance in Korea, and last week announced increased distribution within Seoul, as well as further expansion into four additional cities.","We remain on track to be in key cities or nationwide in a total of 30 to 35 markets by yearend, subject to capacity. Importantly, we continue to grow the national share of our heated tobacco portfolio sequentially in many of our early launch markets beyond Japan. For example, in Italy, Portugal and Romania, our national share increased to 0.6% or above in the second quarter.","While we have expanded the weighted retail distribution of our heated tobacco portfolio across these markets, Japan remains, for the time being, the only market with national coverage, due to capacity constraints.","In many of our more recent launch markets, we are recording positive sequential quarterly offtake share trends within the current focus areas, as seen on this slide. Our performance in Greece for example, has been particularly strong, reaching 2% share in the Athens region less than one year after launch.","To conclude, our second-quarter results were robust, reflecting sequential improvements in total volume and market share compared to the first quarter. Our currency-neutral net revenue growth in the quarter was strong, driven by the continued momentum of IQOS and favorable pricing. We now expect full-year currency-neutral net revenue growth of over 7% in 2017.","Our 2017 EPS guidance, revised today for currency only, continues to reflect a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12%, excluding currency and the favorable tax item, this compares to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","Finally, we remain focused on generously rewarding our shareholders with our robust cash flow. For the year, we continue to target operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion and capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. Thank you. And I'll be happy now to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct a question-and-answer portion of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the name Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Nicholas Rolli","Hello, Vivien.","Jacek Olczak","Hello, Vivien.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Patty Kanada","Hi, good morning. This is Patty\u2026","Jacek Olczak","Hi, good morning, Bonnie.","Patty Kanada","Hi, this is Patty Kanada calling in for Bonnie. Just a quick question on South Korea, is there - could you give us a sense of what you've learnt so far with IQOS there in terms of conversation rates, cannibalization, any big surprises you could share? Are you feeling incrementally more or less optimistic about the replicability of the Japan model there?","Jacek Olczak","It's very early stages, but for reasons we are not talking about the market share et cetera. But I think first reaction of Korean smokers are much better than what we experienced at the same period when we entered Japan, largely much better. I guess, obviously, Korea benefits from the somehow cross-border growing awareness coming from Japan. So the grant at the consumer level really was a better prepared. But, I think Korea might equally or better surprise us in terms of the results in Japan. This would be my reading at this stage.","Patty Kanada","Okay. Just one quick follow-up on Japan pricing. Could you confirm that you applied to rise prices in September, and if so, would that be absent of any sort of tax increase, which I think is more typically the time that we see pricing?","Jacek Olczak","Finally, we have applied for the price increase of Marlboro and a conventional - the conventional cigarettes. And timing for the implementation is September this year. I'm not aware at this stage of any other competitor price changes in Japan.","Patty Kanada","Okay. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Good morning. Hi.","Nicholas Rolli","Hi, Judy.","Judy Hong","So, Jacek, a couple of questions first on your guidance. First, just in terms of thinking about your revenue growth guidance FX neutral, now you're expecting over 7%, but you haven't changed the earnings guidance FX neutral; so I just wanted to get a sense of why not higher in terms of earnings, even with higher revenue. And then, even the 7% revenue growth guidance seems somewhat conservative in the context of IQOS likely to really build much more contribution in the back half with the capacity ramping up. So just trying to get a sense of - I know you said over 7%, but kind of what sort of contribution from IQOS in the back half should we expect in terms of the revenue?","Jacek Olczak","Look, Judy, it all boils down to the available capacity, okay? I think we observe as we speak a better productivity from the installed machines. So we might be able to go beyond the 32 billion, which we had initially announced available capacity for this year. If this would happen, I mean, it clearly will be able to sell or to ship more.","But I can say, look, if we have that product available and then we can actually do the revenue better than 7%. But at this stage, we'll just say that we will be about 7%. More precisely that number will be - I think we'll update it that outlook in Q3, as we will know so much really the productions we had capacity with them. When it comes to the one point lift in our revenue guidance if you like, and they're not lifting the guidance. I mean, we have a range, 9% to 12%, so this is pretty - or relatively broad territory.","I have highlighted in my remarks that we actually have a pretty challenging situation from a pricing perspective in Russia, so we have to be relatively cautious on this one. Although, very recently it comes from good news from the fiscal authorities with regards on the view on the potential excise increase in 2018, which will not really or at all change the 2017, but gives us a better outlook for 2018. And we still have to see what is the total impact from this very high tax price increase in Saudi. Okay, and that's very much the Q2 - sorry, Q3, Q4 type of event, which we have in front of us.","We'll see what we'll have. We're continuously investing behind the IQOS. As you could see, the growth rate in all geographies are very solid, very good, very encouraging. We opened recently Korea. We have a few other markets which we will have - very likely - we'll have to very likely put up the investment to support that revenue level, which these markets are generating now. We will see how we close.","But I think it's a nice problem to have as long as we see the good quality of a top-line growth and you presumably notice that for the first time we're not only driving the revenue by pricing variance, but there is a pretty good contribution at the revenue level from a volume mix actually or product mix.","So I think the quality very nicely comes to the top line. And I think it will one day also flow very nicely to the bottom line.","Judy Hong","Okay. And then, just - my second question is just in terms of thinking about IQOS and seeing particularly in the markets where obviously some of the competitive products have launched. So in Sendai in Japan, you obviously had a little bit more of a lead time in IQOS being in those markets before glo came in.","In Korea, it sounds like you're going to have glo going in more quickly. Korea Tobacco talking about a competitive launch there too. So I'm just wondering from your perspective, just not having that much of a lead-time in those markets, do you think that that's going to curtail IQOS' performance? Or if you kind of look at markets in Japan, just the broader category expansion could be accelerated and so for IQOS could continue to grow.","So how do you sort of think about the timing of some of these competitive launches now in some of the markets that could be sooner than what you saw in Japan?","Jacek Olczak","Look, I think that - we actually welcome the competitors entering the Heat-not-Burn category, because from a consumer awareness perspective, et cetera, it's actually going to be helpful other than us riding the - building the awareness of the category, the product, the brand in our own. We have been coexisting at least at the city-type basis, with competitors' product, the [GET product and the BET] [ph] product.","You see the trajectory of - the growth trajectory of IQOS in these places, I mean, it's still pretty comfortable. But overall, I think it's actually not that bad, but the competitors also coming to the market and the general awareness of the product is - of the product categories - sorry - is growth.","I mean, IQOS, it is early days. I mean, we'll have to look at the national expansion like here announced by the competitors in Japan. I mean, how it is going to change the dynamics in terms of the growth rates of IQOS. But at this stage, I think we feel pretty confident that consumer will - we will continue having a high conversion rate and very importantly higher stickiness rate to our proposition.","Judy Hong","Got it, okay. And then just finally quickly on the hedging on the Yen, because it sounds like second quarter, the FX was a lot worse than many people had anticipated, so can you just give a sense of what happened in 2Q from a hedge perspective and where we are at this point?","Jacek Olczak","Well, at the beginning of the year, if I remember, we said that we will cover to the Yen for about 40%. We obviously brought up the hedge ratio higher to about 50%. But in the meantime, the cash flows and revenue from Japan start shooting higher also than we initially thought. So it's a little bit now of a moving target. So therefore, we have the exposure - we have this exposure, still uncovered exposure on Yen. But the Yen in Q2, just Q2, if I take the actual, right, the $0.11 which we had in the quarter, the Yen actually contributed to the negative only by $0.01.","I think it's more what we think will be the cash flows and our hedge ratios going forward and it will value this at the spot rate. So this obviously changes the outlook, i.e., the guidance over $0.14. So, two currencies which moved us in this quarter were Euro by $0.04 and Egyptian pound over $0.04. And Egyptian pound is something which we need to pay attention, because we had the - last quarter of 2016 we had a quite big negative currency variance, despite the fact that the majority of the currencies were actually improving versus dollar.","And these were the transactional losses, which we incurred on Egyptian pound. Now, Egyptian pound is relatively are pretty stable since then, after this massive devaluation. So at the current spot rate we should have a complete reversal of the negative variance on a currency line in Q4, which may lead to the - or it should lead the current spot rate to the situations that we will have some negative currency in Q3. And we should flip completely to the positive currency in Q4 and this blended will give us this $0.14, which we have announced today in the guidance.","Judy Hong","Okay. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning. Thanks, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Matthew.","Matthew Grainger","Thanks. I wanted to come back to the Russia pricing dynamic and sounds like this may continue for at least a few more months. Is that going to have any impact on your expectations for 6% combustible pricing for the year or any impacts on your ability to reach potentially the higher end of the EPS guidance range? And when we think about potential offsets in the P&L to help compensate for lower pricing there, do you have sufficient flexibility in other markets to compensate for that without having to make any changes in your RRP investment plans?","Jacek Olczak","Matthew, without going into specifically the pricing variance for the full year, which obviously Russia will wait, because now for the six months, two quarters, we essentially have no net pricing despite the fact that for the first two quarters PMI had about 6% pricing variance, but it's going to wait for the year. I'd rather focus that the pricing situation in Russia is, in fact, well factored in our net revenue outlook for the year by above 7%, this is probably trying to manage the situations, clearly it always have had not allow the pricing opportunity to take extra pricing in Russia, I mean, net revenue and pricing volumes correspondingly would be high. This is the situations in Russia today.","To remember usually as of Q2, us, I guess, industry where even net positive start of a pricing situation in Russia, right, to generate tax increases pass on a little bit ahead was that back end of the year, the previous year, and the current year, and now we aimed in June, and my estimates are correct, industry and us are presumably few rubles maybe up to 5 rubles below the pass-on as of January this year. So actually the only pricing which we have in Russia today, is the fading out annualization of the past year, and you have no net pricing due to current year.","But as I said, this is factored in at 7% higher revenue growth for us. That's the situation.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks. And just in terms of the impact on the EPS outlook and where you might found that range, obviously you don't want pullback it all on standing behind IQOS in the broader RRP platforms. Are there - are you confidence that there is enough additional offsets in the combustible business maybe stronger profit performance in other combustible markets that could help compensate for that or its pricing doesn't come through, does that limit your ability to maybe get to the higher end of the 9% to 12% range?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean, the few factors which we have for the Q3 and Q4 ahead us. First, I think, we expect the correction of volumes in Indonesia due to the timing, right, because Indonesia along due to the timing of this inventory movements around Ramadan and et cetera, I guess our estimate is about 2 billion units in Indonesia, which we should see the payback of that in Q3. There is a bit lower growth in Indonesia compared to the last year, but pricing goes through the consumer is a bit softer than in past years.","Philippines are going where we wanted Philippines to go. So that's - I wouldn't expect any surprises price gap's getting close. Marlboro performance well. I think we might also improve our competitive situation and profitability situations at the bottom end of the market, I think, Philippines should nicely be continue contributing. Indonesia, I said, should have a better second half of the year than the first half of the year.","Pakistan a little help on the volumes, the Pakistan is not really the driver of the financial performance, but it's good to solve this problem. Russia, I don't think - I wouldn't count on any surprises on a pricing there on both sides. And the question mark is how consumers going to take this 100% of doubling the prices in Saudi, and they are still a few other GCC states, which as we understand also planned to increase the taxes between now and the year-end, so we'll have to see how this unfolds.","The EU has a good strength both on the underlying volumes. Share is in a good shape is more the questions how much, we will report in terms of the investment behind than IQOS, which we may reach the sacrifice the profitability within EU for the sake of building the right revenue opportunity, which lies in front of IQOS in EU. This is how I will do. The range is 9% to 12%, how we - there was the reasons why we expanded that range, I think we will deliver in the range. That's clearly the report today we have to have. We have not revised the range, both the target EPS range probably 5% in currency. We will reach the high-end of the range. Look, I mean, the speculations we'll have to see.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Hopefully, Russia improves. And then can I just ask about plain packaging in France and the UK, UK is pretty recent, but France since beginning of the year. Can you just give us whatever observation you have at this point on consumer behavior and reaction what the impact has been on mix dynamics volumes? Has there been any shift in pricing dynamics in the super-low segment in the UK since May?","Jacek Olczak","I think, you guys, a little bit still early to talk about this. France is a few months longer with plain packaging. And I don't want to sound sarcastic, okay. But I remember when we had these discussions in Australia, a couple of years ago, the early quarters of implementation, there was the market share erosions and down trading, and people were trying to connect the dots between plain packaging, and what is happening in the market, which we were arguing that this is correlation of quotation at the best place.","In France actually Marlboro grew share in the quarter by 60 basis points. This is the quarter post plain packaging implementation. And I am not implying discussed through of the plain packaging, I think this is the never argument for each the market dynamics at this in a short-term is nothing so there was the plain packaging implementation. We always - we are using this argument that the two things are somehow thought to relate.","And actually my total share, if I recall the number correctly in a release. I think, we grew the share total PMI by almost one full 90 basis points, while doesn't seem there is a down trading in a market, doesn't seem that the premium brands or premium segments at this stage is impacted by plain packaging, but I won't to be surprised frankly speaking, that it would be.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Great. Thanks, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lavery","Thanks. With the question earlier, you touched a little bit on some of the awareness boost that you get from having Japan right next door and some interaction there. Can you just talk a little bit about in other markets, how you're expanding for this year compares to what you had expected or thought that it would be. And related to that how much does national distribution really help in terms of just getting in front of many more people and helping the word of mouth or sort of network effect, and are you spending and need to offset not having national distribution in some markets in Europe, for example?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you. It's a very good question actually, because, yes, the national distribution would help in the building the momentum and growing the awareness on behalf of our international distribution requires the full availability of full capacity, okay, to meet very lightly searching demand. So reasons why we holding many of our markets essentially, all of our markets outside Japan for the city-type of territories, it's for the reasons that we'll create essentially on a manageable constraint on the supply chain.","We are barely still until the end of this quarter. We are coping with Japan. The capacity should start this in Q3, Q4. But again, as we have highlighted through before over the - I mean the priorities to stabilize Japan from a supply chain perspective, okay. And we need to leave the quota for the devices, we also working on developing the second device suppliers. We will have a full flexibility on devices hopefully full flexibility of the HeatSticks volume for Japan.","And then we can start leveraging the expanded distribution as the factor of increasing the awareness in our market. But you're absolutely spot on I your question. There is some correlations between broader availability of the product and the awareness. It's a little bit opportunity. But in territories, surely focused at the stages even this restricted part of the territories as much as obviously, one can restrict territory in a given market. In these restricted territories, the growth trajectory, acceptance, conversations are very positive. I mean, you see this on the chart which regularly update this performance on every market. There are differences between the markets. But they have one common denominator, they all have good offer, that's very encouraging for us.","And with regards to spending, we will maintain high level of spending in Japan that's pretty obvious, but we are now serving, Japan summer this year will close by past 3 million consumers. So that's an obviously entails, so requires some support, which we have a link to do. And obviously building up, or preparing the rest of the market mainly, EU. You will see by the spending year-on-year in comparison behind IQOS in particular in the EU Region. Obviously, Korea will come in Asia. This is on the early stages so there will be investment, mainly at Korea.","Michael Lavery","Okay, yes. Thank you. And then just on Indonesia, certainly the machine-made kreteks have been gaining a lot of momentum, and you have typically been underrepresented there. How significant you think this Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild launch can be? And how do you see the portfolio evolving as far as where the consumer demand has been making shifts?","Jacek Olczak","It can be very significant. I mean, where we trying to compete on a full flavor pipe part of the machine-made and the lighter - or lighters, smoother part of that segment. It is a growing segment. I mean, this largely - fastest growing segment. We obviously - it's important segment for us, it's a building block of our continuous leadership in the market. So we will be very focused there.","We also very pleased with the Marlboro trends to the kreteks segment, if you like. Very good results despite that there were some sort of cannibalization between Marlboro Whites and Marlboro - to Marlboro kretek combined Marlboro Fresh nicely grew this year. I think there is still a distribution expansion ahead of this brand. So despite that they are not in international wide availability, they're very nicely both the proposition already contributing to the overall share of the Indonesian market.","So we are very pleased with this, and we'll continue focus on this. There will be some happening from time to time, which is very much around the pricing. There are some brands, which are sitting at around per pack price points. But we had it in the past. So this is sort of a cyclical type of a thing, and - but we'll focus to conclude the answering your questions, we'll focus on the machine-made segment going forward.","Michael Lavery","I think the Marlboro kretek launched about eight or nine months ago. And you said, it still has some distribution upside. How do you expect the distribution trajectory for Dji Sam Soe Magnum Mild with that move a little more quickly or something similar?","Jacek Olczak","Yes. I mean, we're building this distribution, will it go faster than Marlboro. It's hard to - for me to say now, but clearly, we have that expansion. The classical launch planned in Indonesia, with you start with x number of territories. You build that brand there, and then, you start going to a number of territories, pretty large market, right. So we don't have despite the fact that we think we have a pretty strong capability to deploy - deployment capability in Indonesia. We have the capability to have our Indonesia in one month or two months in terms of a national distribution.","Michael Lavery","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe","Good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could first on the volume performance in the quarter, particularly also around the combustible volumes. Was this quarter in line with your expectations from like a - so the sequential progress you made in volume. There were some puts and takes this quarter, no doubt, but does this put you on track towards your progress towards that negative 3 to negative 4 for the year?","Jacek Olczak","No. It was IQOS could, I guess, by not better than we initially would have thought, but this is more the function of how much product we have available. So we just - which has essentially sold those [indiscernible] what we could. And on the combustible business, on the conventional business not much actually surprises. I mean, we knew that, we have that [indiscernible] but the timing in Indonesia. I have quantified this is roughly about $2 billion for us, but this what should see in Q3. So the Q3 should come stronger versus the Q3 last year.","Pakistan, I think, authorities addressing this problem with illicit trade. They're trying to help addressing this problem with creation of this extra tax tier, it's very helpful. I mean, that come as a surprise, but the results volume-wise, I think should start growing Q3 and Q4. And we know that we expecting that tax increase in GCC. Okay, Saudi started - okay, it's a little bit of impact on Q2 volume. But we sometime - we've somehow been factoring this in our projection.","So remember that during the first quarter earnings call, I said, that we expect the total combined volume for the year to be 2% to 3%. I think, I came that we might actually come - 3% to 4% and that we may come closer to the 3%, actually pretty sure we're going to come closer to the 3% based on what we have achieved in Q2, how we've seen our situations level for the Q3 and Q4.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. When I think about - sorry, go ahead.","Jacek Olczak","Go on. Go on.","Christopher Growe","Just a question relation to your IQOS capacity, we know generally, which you have available for the year. How big of a step forward do you make in Q3, is this the quarter we are going to see a marked improvement in your capacity availability in the quarter?","Jacek Olczak","Well, Q4 is higher than Q2. But\u2026","Christopher Growe","Thank you. Yes.","Jacek Olczak","And then Q4 will be higher than Q3.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Got you.","Jacek Olczak","But, look, it's - we're gaining - we're taking the benefits now of a better productivity. We can run the machine faster and we can install machine faster. So it's not necessary that we can accelerate the CapEx as such. But once the machine arrives at the factory, we can put them in a production much faster than the first groups of machines. So it's obvious gain on the timing of implementation. And clearly we have a gain that the factory people are doing the spectacular job with how well they start running this machines, and this is becoming material.","So I have said as answer to the one of the previous questions, we will end up with the higher volume than a 32 billion. That's very clear to me. But at this stage, I wouldn't like to commit to this, because this is a productivity gains. So the calculation is a little bit more complicated. But for sure, we are going to end up with higher volume than 32 billion guaranteed.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Just to be clear, are there any markets where you'd have a national - you want to be national by the end of the year. Or it just a matter of the incremental capacity being used for incremental markets to get to those 30 to 35 markets?","Jacek Olczak","I think, we'll try to build the full - we'll have to unblock the supply chain for Japan first, which includes proper lifting hopefully the caps on the devices. We have on hand in Japan, onshore, the right inventory. So we can have smooth operations from the supply chain perspective in Japan. That's our objective number one. So most of the capacity will be - our priority on the capacity allocations would be for Japan.","So I don't think we might be in a situation to push any market outside Japan for the national distribution. I don't think we'll be in the positions to do so. But then obviously is Korea, as I hinted, Korea started better than Japan, and we have to start factoring Korea in this calculations as well. So I think - so we will now go national outside Japan this year, like, 99% guarantee.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Thanks so much for you time and your color. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi, can you hear me out?","Jacek Olczak","Yes. Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer","Hi, guys. Sorry about that. So I did want to follow-up on IQOS, please. So my first question on Japan. We noticed some e-commerce activity on Amazon Prime is that something that you guys are pushing as an initiative? Because it creates a little bit of a disconnect for me when I hear that you guys are still capacity constraint?","Jacek Olczak","Look, this unavailability or not the full availability of the devices has created a lot of opportunities for our people, completely not related to Philip Morris, and I guess, this is from what you're referring to. So we have a number of e-commerce sites in a various number of places, not only in Japan, but outside Japan, with our devices somehow are being sold. And you know, Vivien, very well, we have a listed of $100 plus-minus the currency in different countries. And we ended up with devices being sold on this various e-commerce site at the prices of $600, $800 or even $1000.","So that's the situation, until the moment when we completely lift the caps on the devices. And we will be in the - in ability to supply fully the market, we'll have all of these things. We have our online sales, our own online PMI sales in the different countries. You can go to the iqos.com, korea.com, et cetera. But we are not pushing this for the third party channel.","Vivien Azer","Great. Thanks for the clarification. My second question on IQOS development recognizing the bulk of the business is still coming out of Japan. But as you look beyond Japan, in some of these other markets, considering that you have made some adjustments to the product packaging and branding. Have you noticed any differences in terms of initial cannibalization now that you've deemphasized or in some cases, totally eliminated the Marlboro aspect of the HEETS branding?","Jacek Olczak","No, there is no correlation. Actually, where we're selling the product, there's a Marlboro and the Marlboro trademark in Japan or as HeatSticks from Marlboro in other places, which is the [Park, Dresden and other] [ph] places, there is no differences in cannibalization between the two geography.","Vivien Azer","Great. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","And you next question comes from Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman","Thank you. So my first question is about IQOS is Europe. You said a couple of times that you're increasing the marketing there. But when I look at Slide 20 and Slide 21, I see sequentially the growth is slower. So it slowed a bit in Italy, in Switzerland, throughout the same in Portugal, but faster, I think in Romania, slowed in Germany, slowed in Greece in second quarter, slowed in Russia.","But I just wondering, what I should make of that, particularly in light of the fact that you said that when you get to sort of 1% or 2%, or 3% market share we should expected to accelerate? So that would be my first question. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Good afternoon, Adam. Look, the territories which we are listing on the slide, okay, you have to look that we still very much focus depends on the country, on the cities, right, not even on the entire territories. If I give example of Switzerland, right, because presumably, might for some, look like a slowdown in the penetration of the growth of a market share. I mean, you have to really zoom what is happening in Geneva, Lausanne, Neuchatel and Zurich, I mean, a few places where we're really focused, okay. Some of these places, iQOS is already above 3% or 4%, some of the place, I think, is even closer to the 6%.","Obviously, in this territory, altogether, including the villages, you have to look at the urbanization, non-urbanization of Switzerland, I mean, this turns to 0.9%. We're not worried about this at all. In every zooming territory in which we are, we have a good trajectory, and therefore, the investment is behind these markets to have a right base going forward, but also remember that we expanding our territories, which are not even in Europe, which are not even in this chart. That is obviously entails the additional spend.","We don't read the chart in a way that - Greece, in my opinion, have a very spectacular growth rate, and we know that the Greece could have gone higher if we would allow Greece to expand broader. We're just focusing on what we focus. It's good that is relatively faster or slower, the famous 2%, 3% that which we think is the point from which the word of mouth et cetera, start to help.","Adam Spielman","So as I just to be clear, what you said about Switzerland, just zooming on that. But in Zurich and Geneva, we're accelerating up to, I don't know 3% or 4%. But nonetheless the rest of Switzerland is going backwards so fast that overall the market share has only gone up 10 bps on a nationwide basis?","Jacek Olczak","No. I am talking that the 42% weighted distribution on our Switzerland, but the real focus is on few cities. And obviously for the distributions, when you have a HeatSticks available in the stores, et cetera, there is not much of the IQOS sales shop - support, okay. The focus is in the big cities of relative to the size of Switzerland. And there, if I look at the readings, as I said, in the places like Lausanne, Geneva, few others, I mean, they pretty impressive. That is what I mean.","Adam Spielman","Okay. Thank you. So moving onto the conventional business. In the past, you used to have a target of 46% top line growth. That's growth constant currency. This half, you've done minus 2%. You obviously said that it will accelerate a bit in the second half, helped by Indonesia, in particular, but also Philippines, for example. The question is, do you - are you happy enough with the way the combustible business is going? Do you feel that you are just happy to let it go, the current run-rate, so do you think you need a total increased investments there?","Jacek Olczak","No, we're happy with the progress we're making on the conventional business. I mean, you have to - there is a reason why we're talking about the total revenue line and the combined volumes, et cetera, because you'll have to now factor back to the combustible business, the volumes and the margins and the revenues which we are cannibalizing on the way, okay? So that's the job.","Am I happy with the development of pricing in Russia? Clearly, not, okay. So it's - and am I happy that the consumer - are we happy that the consumer in Indonesia is a bit softer? I mean, obviously not. Am I happy that Mighty was not really playing fairly or faring the market? No. So we always will have the [indiscernible] the situation.","But the way we love to handle that thing is actually we can grow the revenue or deliver the pricing value, for the six months of 6%, despite the fact that we had this clearer headwind that we can deliver the good quality, in my opinion, very good quality, in my opinion top-line growth of 7% or above for the full year, which is a nice mixing of the pricing and the volume rather than just the pricing with just the past [indiscernible].","I'm very pleased with this development. I mean, we're very much looking at the quality of the top-line growth. And you see this quarter, and revenue level at least, I mean, for the first time we're turning into positive volume type of a territory in terms of the contribution from IQOS.","Adam Spielman","And then very quickly, any comments on the Platform 4 test in Birmingham and do you have anything sort of new or specific you should say about the - I think it's going to be in 4Q that Platform 2 test that you're thinking about.","Jacek Olczak","The old platform as we said before, sorry the two and three before the year-end should go to the test market.","Adam Spielman","City test, yeah.","Jacek Olczak","Yeah, city test market and platform for the product growth is now hearing the comments of the feedback which we get from the consumers in Birmingham. And this is incorporating or incorporating this feedback into the next version of the product. This was the purpose of the test market.","I think the MESH, we delivered on what we wanted to deliver. But also that has also to see what else we should add to the product in terms of the performance of that, try to address what are the consumer needs. But that's the part of our - you will see more of the things that the test market is for the purpose of really verifying in real-life what we need to do and then go back quickly to the drawing board and follow up shortly with the new product release.","We somehow went for this very quickly in Japan. But people may not remember that their version of the IQOS device, which we have sold initially during the test market in Nagoya is a different product version which we have nationally expanded. And it is a different product version what we are shipping to Japan right now.","So Japan is already at the third generation or release if you like of the devices and you incorporate the feedback from the consumers. And I guess, other platforms will follow the same sort of a pattern.","Adam Spielman","Thank you. I have more questions, but I think I should give somebody else a go. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Leinster with Berenberg.","Jonathan Leinster","Hi, Jonathan. Yeah, now a few questions, if I may. First of all, with regard to Japan, what sort of inventory levels, trade inventory levels are there in terms of IQOS? And given you just talked about still being sort of capacity-constrained and wanting to build out a supply chain and such, what level of inventory in a perfect world would you be looking at in that sort of environment?","Jacek Olczak","Well, usually we target inventory in terms of the duration, right? So if I would compare the duration of inventory there for IQOS compared to what we strategically or normally maintain for the conventional IQOS would be below conventional, so that's clearly the level of inventories which is not sufficient to maintain the current level of operation.","Now, obviously on a conventional business in Japan even before the opening of a new product category, the market is in a secular decline rate, et cetera. So from time to time, your inventories automatically have a longer duration if you don't adjust the volume. IQOS is a reverse situation. I mean, as result - on a projected volume, what we think is the duration. And if I don't ship the product next week the inventory is going to grow dramatically, because I'm on the increasing shipments to the retailer.","So I would - our thinking is that we should end up in Japan with the inventories at minimum duration-wise with the level of conventional cigarettes. And actually if we could, we would like to build that inventory higher, because let us remember that we still today have one operation - one manufacturing center supplying the market. So our dependence from the risk perspective is - risk management perspective is extremely hard, completely different than what we have on the conventional cigarettes.","But we have said it already with the Q1 that if we can build inventory in Japan, which will allow us to operate more freely the supply chain, we will do it this year.","Jonathan Leinster","Sorry, I missed the last one, did you say, 10 billion?","Jacek Olczak","No, I didn't say 10 billion.","Jonathan Leinster","Sorry, okay, and what\u2026","Jacek Olczak","I was referring to the duration of inventories, okay. So without\u2026","Jonathan Leinster","And what duration normally would there be on the FMC [ph] side then?","Jacek Olczak","You're talking somewhere between up to about three months. But you need to take into consideration that the shipments to Japan are literally taking - are going by water. So your inventory is essentially on the water. So two-thirds of that duration is not accessible for sales in Japan, because it's in the pipeline to Japan. It's the [indiscernible].","Jonathan Leinster","Okay, okay. And in terms of capacity constraints, I mean, when we were into Q3, I mean, I think you were suggesting that you were still capacity constrained in terms of Japan, so does that mean the leaning come off now in Q4?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we'll have increased sales and shipments to Japan, because that capacity - we're producing more week-by-week and month-by-month. But what we say that, hopefully, around the Q4 we should be in that situation that we can ship to the shops what is required and somehow in parallel get the inventory right, which would absorb any sales. We can leave the surge in demand or we can leave the quarter on the devices and Japan will not be putting further constraints on the supply chain. You'll have gradual expansion\u2026","Jonathan Leinster","All right, and in terms of the - okay, gradual expansion, okay. I was going to say, in Japan, in terms of the Marlboro price rise, I mean, clearly, there was some there that one of your competitors increased prices of one of its major brands last year and then there was not much of the response from anybody. And conversely, in France, there has been a tax rise, but there has been no increase in prices including obviously Marlboro which is the largest brand.","I mean, can you explain, first of all, what's the theory behind moving the prices for Marlboro in Japan? And secondly, with regards to France, why has the industry decided to simply absorb the tax?","Jacek Olczak","Not, I mean, the pricing decisions are made to - are in our case country-by-country basis. So I wouldn't link the price development on our side in France to what we have done in Japan. We just think that taking into considerations the market dynamics, the projected elasticity, et cetera that we could increase the prices in Japan. As you might have heard, the initial attempt was to increase for more brands than just Marlboro. We ended up with Marlboro increase. So this is what it is.","And I have no clue whatsoever why the industry, as you phrase it, have decided not to pass on the tax in France. I can speak for Philip Morris. Again, it's the case in Italy very often, we look at tax structure, we look at brand elasticity, and we're just running the numbers whether this makes sense or not in the current configuration, the increased prices from the view of growing the profitability and we just moving the pricing variance with the volume variance and vice versa, that's the situation.","Having said that, and as you noticed, despite the fact that - we didn't have the pricing in France where there is no pricing still in Japan et cetera, we still had the 6% pricing variance for the six months of the year. So somehow, they have this factored in 12 months.","Jonathan Leinster","But just following up on that, in Japan you'd be quite happy if Marlboro is the only price that went up?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we're always happy, if you like, if the prices are going up.","Jonathan Leinster","Yeah, okay. And very lastly, what do you think that the total sort of conventional cigarette volumes globally are likely to decline this year?","Jacek Olczak","I guess, somewhere this 2% to 3%. And I don't think we would - if the Pakistan - we will have to now start factoring in this. Russia, I think this 5% to 6% about right. Euro, volume view, which we have to forecast, should be around what we have said. I think Indonesia should now have a bit of better volumes. The question is what's going to continue to happen in Philippines. But we observe some relatively moderations in the decline rates relative.","Pakistan, which is a big market thinking the international volumes. I think the 2% to 3% of the industry seems like a right number for the year.","Jonathan Leinster","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Thomas Russo with Gardner Russo.","Thomas Russo","Yes, hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Tom, thank you for calling.","Thomas Russo","Yes, right, good morning. Couple of quick questions. The first, I read the - maybe your General Counsels appearing before the FDA in light of the submissions. I would love to have an update on the submissions, their progress, and then what the steps might be for Altria under your agreement with them, what opportunities do they have to start to roll out IQOS, first question.","Jacek Olczak","I guess you're referring to that Marc Firestone recent address with regards to illicit trade.","Thomas Russo","Yes.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, well, I mean, look, I mean, there is a number of countries which we see a pretty good improvement on illicit trade. But I think also Marc was trying to show in our experiences, one can help in collaborations industry and collaborations with the government, continuing probing this trend, so\u2026","Thomas Russo","Yes.","Jacek Olczak","And, as I said, I mean, we follow up for a while. You see that over the last two, three years, we've made a pretty, I would argue, significant improvement with regards to illicit trade. There are still some pockets which have to be addressed. But globally I think it is getting better. And with regards to Altria, I think Altria waits, as we are waiting for FDA, premarket approval authorization with the FDA.","Thomas Russo","Yes.","Jacek Olczak","And counting just my calendar days, somewhere before the year-end it should happen. So Altria would be - should be good to go to launch the product in the U.S. And I know from our collaborations with Altria that Altria is working on the plans to - for this to happen. We're just waiting for FDA.","Thomas Russo","Great. Also, I read, Jacek, at some place, reference to a new IQOS Heat cigarette manufacturing facility authorized to get built in Germany. What is the timing of that and what's the capacity of that?","Jacek Olczak","Production of Germany will lead to the capacity beyond January 2019.","Thomas Russo","Oh, I see.","Jacek Olczak","Our numbers for today are, as we said, 50 year-end installed this year, plus minus now the productivity gains which I highlighted in answer to the previous questions.","Thomas Russo","Yes.","Jacek Olczak","That we actually may leave the 100 year-end installed capacity 2018 and Dresden facilities to start contributing beyond. So this is our second, if you like, greenfield operations of Cologne. In the meantime, we talk about Greece, we talk about Romania, et cetera, which are the retrofitting or converting the conventional capacity into the RRP capacity, so we got\u2026","Thomas Russo","Great. And then, what happens in the capacity at launch for Dresden, how large would that start and how will it grow over time?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we will build it to the appropriate level of capacity.","Thomas Russo","Well, that's a good answer, thank you. And then who will supply the actual products to the U.S. market?","Jacek Olczak","Initially, PMI.","Thomas Russo","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","And then we'll have to see.","Thomas Russo","Thanks for the update. Bye.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","And with that, I'll hand the program back over to you, Mr. Nick Rolli, for any additional or closing remarks.","Nicholas Rolli","Well, that concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining us. And if you have any follow-up questions, you can contact the Investor Relations team here in Switzerland. Thanks again and have a nice day.

We will also report our combined estimated market share in certain markets, as we currently do for Japan, to the extent that reliable data is available.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer, will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer period. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. 2016 was a pivotal year for PMI, reflecting exciting progress in our transformation from combustible tobacco products to a Reduced-Risk Products focused company. While our combustible tobacco portfolio continue to drive our income growth, we began to see clear signs of the enormous potential of our RRP portfolio. As expected, we closed 2016 with exceptionally strong quarterly results, driven by the annualization of price increases and the growth of RRPs coupled with a favorable cost comparison.","Net revenues increased by 10.5% excluding currency while adjusted OCI and adjusted diluted EPS increased by over 47% and 51%, respectively, on the same basis. Full-year net revenues increased by 4.4% excluding currency driven by a favorable pricing variance equivalent to 6% of prior-year net revenues, and the strong performance of RRPs, notably HeatSticks and IQOS devices.","As in any year, we faced some unique challenges in 2016 such as the very large excise tax increase in Argentina, the surge of illicit trade in Pakistan and the cigarette industry volume declines in the Philippines and Thailand. In aggregate, these items had an adverse effect on our volume and net revenues but a very limited impact on our adjusted OCI due to the low corresponding margins.","Please note that approximately 22% of our $733 million in 2016 (4:21) RRP net revenues were from IQOS devices, which yielded a negative margin due to introductory discounts offer in the initial commercialization phase to accelerate adult smoker switching. Clearly, the economics of the devices will improve over time as we reach broader adult smoker acceptance.","Adjusted operating company's income increased by a robust 10.3% excluding currency, driven by higher net revenues on the same basis and a favorable cost comparison versus 2015 notwithstanding continued investment behind RRPs.","Our results were strong across all four regions, with currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth ranging from 8.7% in the European Union to 12.6% in EEMA. Adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.6 points to 41.8%, or by 2.4 points to 43.6% excluding currency, again, with gains across all four regions.","Adjusted diluted EPS increased by 11.8% excluding currency in 2016. Importantly, adjusted diluted EPS grew by 1.4% including currency, representing the first such increase since 2013. Full-year free cash flow was stable at $6.9 billion despite unfavorable currency of $340 million and our previously announced increase in capital expenditures to support the manufacturing capacity expansion of HeatSticks. Excluding currency, free cash flow increased by 4.9%.","As I mentioned previously, our strong financial results were achieved despite a cigarette shipment volume decline in 2016. Some 40% of the decline was due to Pakistan and the Philippines, where the volume erosion was concentrated in low-unit margin brands that had a limited impact on our bottom line.","A portion of our cigarette volume decline was also due to in-switching to HeatSticks from our own cigarette brand, a trend that we expect to continue going forward. HeatSticks volume reached 7.4 billion units, which reflected our maximum manufacturing capacity for 2016. HeatSticks volume would have been much higher absent this capacity restriction, which obliged us to limit IQOS device sales in Japan since June.","Our cigarette market share excluding China and the U.S. declined by 0.6 points in 2016, with low-price Fortune and super-low price Jackpot, both in the Philippines, accounting for 0.5 points of the total decline. Cigarette share for the balance of our portfolio was essentially stable.","Marlboro continued its widespread growth with cigarette share increases in the EU, Asia, and Latin America, and Canada regions. Importantly, the brand's cigarette share growth in Asia was achieved in spite of the impact of Marlboro HeatSticks growth in Japan. Marlboro's decline in EEMA was due essentially to Algeria, reflecting significant adult smoker rejection of the 2.0 Architecture for Marlboro Round Taste. As noted during our September Investor Day, we instituted a number of initiatives to address this weakness and, as of the fourth quarter, the brand had already recovered close to 6 points of market share compared to its nadir in the second quarter.","I will now discuss our performance in a few of our key geographies, beginning with the European Union region. Currency-neutral adjusted OCI increased for the second straight year, with higher pricing driving growth of over 8%.","Full year cigarette industry volume declined by 1.6%, with the decrease concentrated in the fourth quarter. This primarily reflects a difficult comparison with 2015, which benefited from the estimated positive impact of immigration and a recovery from illicit trade.","Our regional cigarette share was flat in 2016, with growth notably in France, Poland, and Spain, offset mainly by a decline in Italy as a result of our price increase in the second quarter of 2016 and the growth of the super-low price segment. Marlboro's share increased by 0.2 points, growing in most key markets, with the exception of Italy.","Moving to Russia, cigarette industry volume again exceeded our expectations in 2016, with the decline moderating to 4.6% despite a third straight year of weighted average industry retail price increases of above 20%.","Our cigarette market share declined by 1.2 points, due mainly to the slower penetration of competitors' price increases at retail. In addition, following the ban of the production of big packs, effective July 2016, many competitors launched limited pack editions at a discount equivalent to the per-stick price of big packs. We have deployed initiatives to improve our share performance and, indeed, stabilized our sequential quarterly share in the second half of the year.","Strong pricing drove another year of double-digit OCI growth excluding currency, more than offsetting the adverse cigarette volume impact. For reference, amendments to the tax code effective January 2017 were enacted last November, raising the ad valorem rate to 14.5% and increasing both the specific and minimum excise tax.","The weighted average total excise tax pass-on for the industry is around RUB 13 per pack, which equates to an average retail price increase of around 10% and is above the approximately RUB 10 per pack average pass-on for 2016. Importantly, the tax code also now includes the introduction of a weight-based specific excise tax on heated tobacco products.","Turning now to Japan, the growth of RRPs in 2016 had a notable impact on cigarette industry volume, which declined by 4.6% for the full year and by 7.4% in the fourth quarter. HeatSticks' national market share continued its strong sequential growth, reaching 4.9% in the fourth quarter. During the final week of December, HeatSticks' national market share reached an estimated 5.5%, and its off-take share increased to 7%.","Our full-year cigarette market share declined by 0.4 points to 24.9%, due mainly to the impact of HeatSticks. The rate of in-switching to HeatSticks from our own cigarette portfolio declined as the year progressed to an estimated 32% in late 2016. Our combined market share, including cigarettes and HeatSticks increased by 1.7 points to 27.1% in 2016, and by 3.1 points to 28.3% in the fourth quarter.","Indonesia continued to be an important profit driver for PMI in 2016 with double-digit OCI growth, mainly reflecting strong pricing. Cigarette industry volume declined by 1.4%, due mainly to the soft economic environment and higher retail prices driven by weighted average excise tax increase in 2016 of around 15% industry-wide. The excise tax increase for 2017 is around 10% on the same basis, though the government also increased the VAT rate on cigarettes to 9.1% from 8.7% last year. As a result, the weighted average total pass-on for the industry in 2017 is approximately 6% at the retail level compared to 8% in 2016.","The 0.9 points decline in our cigarette market share was due mainly to the soft performance of our lighter-tasting machine-made kretek brand, reflecting the impact of competitors' discounted product offerings. Our share decline was partly offset by the strong performance of our full-flavor machine kretek brand, U Bold. In addition, our Marlboro Filter Black kretek offering, which we launched in 25 cities last September, is performing well and already reached the national market share of 0.5% in the fourth quarter.","Our actions to address our last year's share weakness will continue bearing fruit this year and we project that Indonesia will again be a key contributor to our OCI growth in 2017.","Profit in the Philippines continued to improve in 2016 through higher pricing and favorable mix. While our total cigarette share declined by 2.1 points due mainly to Fortune and Jackpot, Marlboro performed exceptionally, increasing its volume by 25%.","Cigarette industry volume declined by 12%, due principally to the impact of excise tax-driven retail price increases at the bottom of the market in late 2015. Industry volume decreased by 13.2% in the fourth quarter, reflecting the impact of further excise tax-driven price increases at the end of October last year.","Effective January 1 of this year, the excise tax structure in the Philippines was reduced to one tier, with a specific rate of PHP 30 per pack. This completed the tax tier harmonization process, which saw weighted average excise tax increases of 33% on a compound annual basis since 2013. Based on current legislation, the specific rate is scheduled to increase by 4% annually, beginning in 2018. While we expect continued volume softness this year due mainly to the final step in the excise tax tier convergence, we remain positive about the long-term growth potential in this important market.","In the Latin America and Canada region, strong currency-neutral adjusted OCI growth of 12.4% in 2016 was driven by higher pricing, notably in Argentina and Canada. Our original cigarette market share increased by 0.7 points, driven by Marlboro and supported by share gains in Brazil, Canada, and Mexico.","Regional cigarette industry volume declined by 5.9% in 2016, due mainly to tax-driven retail price increases in Argentina and Brazil. We expect the industry volume declines in both markets to moderate in 2017.","To close on 2016, I will highlight the favorable performance of IQOS across the many launch markets beyond Japan. While this performance requires some additional context given the smaller scale of the launches and the role of HeatSticks capacity constraints in the second half of last year, it nonetheless serves as a positive indicator of the potential for IQOS broadly.","One measure that we closely monitor is the rate of IQOS purchasers who fully or predominantly convert to the product. Conversion rates have grown over time and at the end of 2016 stood at approximately 70% or higher. As a reminder, Japan only reached this level in May last year, over 18 months after launch. This confirms that IQOS resonates strongly with adult smokers who try it, irrespective of the market.","We also clearly monitor HeatSticks off-take volumes. During the fourth quarter of 2016, estimated off-take volume in all markets with launches prior to mid-year grew at a compound weekly rate of over 6%, comparable to Japan during the initial launch phase. Such performance augurs well for our planned national expansions which, in Japan, had an accelerating effect.","Turning now to 2017. We enter the year with positive momentum and favorable trends across many of our key geographies, although currency volatility remains an issue. As announced this morning, our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2017 at prevailing exchange rates is a range of $4.70 to $4.85 versus $4.48 in 2016, and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.18. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency of approximately 9% to 12% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","We expect our currency-neutral financial growth to be slightly skewed toward the second half of 2017, reflecting the timing of HeatSticks capacity and phasing of RRP investments, as well as unfavorable cigarette industry volume comparisons with the first half of 2016, notably in Argentina, the EU Region, and Turkey.","The $0.18 of unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates included in our 2017 guidance is driven primarily by the Turkish lira, Euro, Japanese yen, and Mexican peso, partly offset by the Russian ruble.","We've currently hedged approximately 40% of our 2017 forecast sales to Japan which, at prevailing exchange rates, translates to an effective rate of \u00a5 114 to the U.S. dollar versus \u00a5 111 in 2016.","As I noted during last September's Investors Day, the advent of RRPs introduces some additional variables into the attractive and predictable growth equation of our industry. These variables are somewhat less range-bound and linear (18:48) given the emerging nature of the category, but also offer exponential upside. For this reason, we have widened our EPS guidance rates this year to $0.15.","Our EPS guidance reflects net revenue growth in excess of our current currency-neutral annual growth target range of 4% to 6%. We expect this growth to be driven by two main factors: higher RRP volume, reflecting both HeatSticks and IQOS devices; and a favorable pricing variance.","The anticipated pricing variance is equivalent to approximately 6% of our 2016 net revenues. As of today, we have implemented or announced over 60% of the pricing that is included in our guidance. Our guidance also reflects significant incremental investment behind the deployment of our RRP portfolio, partly offset by the judicious reallocation of resources from our combustible tobacco portfolio to RRPs in the relevant markets.","For this year, we are targeting operating cash flow of approximately $8.5 billion, reflecting higher net earnings. We plan to use this cash flow primarily for capital expenditures to support the growth of our business and for dividends, at the board's discretion, to our shareholders.","We anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $1.5 billion this year versus $1.2 billion in 2016. The projected increase is driven by higher investments to support RRP capacity expansion, notably for HeatSticks. Last September, we increased our annual dividend for the ninth consecutive year since the spin in 2008, representing a total increase of approximately 126% at the compound annual growth rate of approximately 11%.","While we expect our combustible tobacco business to remain the primary driver of our financial results in the near term, our Reduced-Risk Products portfolio provides us with the single-largest opportunity to significantly accelerate the growth of our company and generously reward our shareholders.","In 2017, the majority of our RRP commercialization focus will remain on IQOS. To-date, we have launched IQOS in key cities in 20 markets, as seen on this slide, and aim to expand nationally in many of these markets this year as HeatSticks capacity becomes available. We are also targeting launches in key cities in an additional 10 to 15 markets by year-end, subject to capacity.","We began 2017 with approximately 15 billion units of installed annual HeatSticks capacity and expect over 32 billion units in total capacity to be available for commercialization this year. We continue to anticipate an installed annual capacity of approximately 50 billion units by year-end. We look forward to unleashing the true potential of IQOS once the pressure on HeatSticks capacity eases as the year unfolds.","Moving to our other RRP platforms, we expect to conduct city tests for our Platform 2 heated tobacco product and our Platform 3 nicotine-containing product this year. We began the city test of our Platform 4 MESH vaporization technology in Birmingham, UK, late last year. And though still very early, we're pleased by the initial results and our related learnings thus far.","In conclusion, 2016 was a pivotal year for PMI, reflecting exciting progress in our transformation from combustible tobacco products to Reduced-Risk Products focused company. We recorded strong full year currency-neutral financial results, driven by our combustible tobacco business and including an important net revenue growth contribution from RRPs for the first time.","IQOS is performing exceptionally, with its most visible success in Japan, and high conversion rates and off-take volume growth broadly. As of year-end 2016, we estimate that approximately 1.4 million adult consumers have quit smoking cigarettes and converted to IQOS.","Finally, the outlook for our business remains strong. Our 2017 EPS guidance reflects a growth rate of approximately 9% to 12% excluding currency, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $4.48 in 2016.","Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Hi, everyone.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Hi, Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","So, first, just in terms of 2017 guidance, it's now calling for 9% to 12% earnings growth. It's a little bit better than the 8% to 10% algorithm that you had given at the September meeting. So, can you just talk about what's changed in terms of thinking about 2017? And, obviously, you've talked about the IQOS contribution from a revenue standpoint. But are you expecting profit contribution to kick-in in 2017 from an IQOS standpoint?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. The reason, first of all, we increased the range, as I explained, is because there is obviously a bit more volatility as regarding the IQOS HeatSticks sales, but also our capacity. And that explains, more or less, the vast majority of the variability, I would say, okay.","Clearly, IQOS is going to play a big role in our revenue growth next year and here, I would like to give some clarification for all the people on the call and broadly to understand. There is always in the revenues coming from \u2013 a part of the revenues coming from IQOS is due to the device sales. And as I said, this initial commercialization phase, the bottom line contribution of device sales is negative. And if we take 2016 as a proxy, if you look at total IQOS revenues, 22% of those revenues were linked to device sales.","And just to give you another rule of thumb, for your own projections, if we look forward, and I would think that will work for the first year or two, obviously, of IQOS sales, if we have rapid expansion, you should count for every incremental billion sales of HeatSticks, roughly 300,000 to 350,000 sales of devices of IQOS, which have a negative margin. So, we cannot apply our current operating profit margins to the devices. That's all I want all of you to understand, okay.","Having said that, clearly, IQOS will be an increasingly important contributor to our revenue growth. And also, we have to take into consideration there will be much more substantial cannibalization. As I said, 32% of the people switching into IQOS in Japan come from our own brand, and if we take European Union countries, we'll be north of 40%. That's why we said, as we approach this as one company and one business, we'll be reporting combined volumes, because it will be very difficult over time to split the two and calculate cannibalization rate.","So overall, I think we have a very strong guidance for the year. That's really clear. And I'm very happy with \u2013 I don't know if I answered your question entirely or not.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah. I think that's certainly helpful. Just, if I can follow up on Japan, Andr\u00e9, just in terms of what you've seen post the Glo launch in Sendai, and how you think that that's impacting the broader \u2013 the heated tobacco category, as well as your market share performance in that market?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Well, first of all, it's a very good thing that other companies launched heat-not-burn and, in general, Reduced-Risk Products. Because I said many times, once you convince people to move out of cigarettes, then clearly, in my view, the better products in the new category will eventually succeed and prevail.","It's very early days and, obviously, as in any test market, you also have some sales going \u2013 not staying in the city, but going somewhere else. But the results are fairly good. Now, this has not impacted at all the IQOS share, that continued to grow during the period, which to your point, outlines that there is a lot of demand for this new category in Japan. And that's very encouraging for all of us.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then just finally, Jacek, does the inventory impact in the quarter \u2013 it sounds like you had a pretty positive impact in both Japan and Russia, maybe a 2-point of an impact. So, maybe just at the total company level, if you can quantify the inventory impact and how that will impact the 2017 combustible volume, if this reverses in the coming quarters? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Yes. I mean, Russia ended up with a higher inventory, but it was a pretty normal reaction to the price rollouts into the market. So, usually you hike a little bit the inventory, and I think some of this is going to unwind during the year.","And the second thing on Japan is the more \u2013 look, we have a little bit, to be frank, and to link back to what Andr\u00e9 said, I mean IQOS volumes versus the combustible volumes in Japan is a little bit harder for us to predict. So, we might have some temporary disallocations of inventories to the sales there. I think we're going to correct that.","But on the other hand, we ended up, frankly speaking, with almost no inventories for the IQOS combustibles \u2013 sorry, for the IQOS RRPs. So, I think you will see these corrections going forward into 2017.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Hello.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. I guess, first question on IQOS, you've referenced it being present in 30 to 35 markets during 2017 or by the end of 2017. Is it possible to give a sense for how many markets you're targeting to potentially receive full investment in field sales resources, essentially the level of resources that you'd need to fully activate the IQOS platform and break through that 2% to 3% market share threshold as opposed to markets that you'll be in more than just an initial capacity?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. The first thing is we need to differentiate whether in these markets we do city productions or national launches, okay, because that absorbs capacity (31:17) resources.","Now, as an overall picture for this year, clearly, there is substantial incremental investment in commercial expenses behind IQOS. Despite the fact that in the relevant markets, we have also reallocated resources from our existing business to IQOS because everybody will be doing IQOS for a national launch.","So, overall, I think this is all in the guidance, bearing in mind that, you know, if we see more traction and we have the capacity, we may put even more resources behind during the year in terms of field forces and other commercial activities. And if we have capacity constraints, we may postpone some launches, and we all need to live with this variability because it's very difficult for me to predict precisely how this is going to unfold. But overall, the trend is extremely positive, and that's what is reflected in the guidance.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Understood. Thanks, Andr\u00e9. And, Jacek, I was hoping you could speak maybe at a general level to the potential impact of U.S. tax reform on the company. And I know there's a range of possibilities. The statutory rate may go down, that applies to your repatriation. You could have a territorial system where repatriation is tax free. Interest deductibility could be changed. So, I'm just curious how you'd contextualize the potential implications for PM?","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","You have mentioned all variables which are being discussed between the President Trump and the Republicans. We will have to see how this is going to reconcile. I think we'll be preemptive at this stage to give any more sound estimate. I mean, clearly \u2013 I mean a tax reform should allow \u2013 what we hear from the U.S. \u2013 I mean, it should allow for the different repatriation pattern to U.S. But we'll have to see what's going to happen.","If you go to the note, I guess, 11 in our filings, I mean, you'll see we always break down how much tax we pay on a foreign basis \u2013 I mean how much the profit taxes we pay before repatriations to U.S. And the rate \u2013 the blended rate would be somewhere in the range 22%, 22.5%, that's the foreign taxes which we pay on our earnings, which we generate outside U.S.","And then, obviously, to our effective tax rate, which you have today, you have to add the different various cost of the repatriations of this earnings to U.S. and, obviously, the top-up to the 35% statutory in the U.S.","But whatever happens \u2013 I mean, we will not be able, with the current tax regimes staying as they are today, to go to the tax rate lower than this 22%, 22.5%. Okay. This is as the rule of thumb I would use.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, again.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Andr\u00e9 and Jacek.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Hi, Bonnie.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Hi.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I guess my first question is on pricing, which was very strong during the quarter. So, I'm curious what you learned from consumer behavior by taking this much pricing, and then what your elasticity was, and then with pricing consistent across your different brands. In other words, I guess I'm trying to understand if you were able to maintain the same level of price gaps within your portfolio.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Well, there were a couple of price increases that came a bit earlier. In the Philippines we increased, if I recall correctly, in October. We came in the quarter. And in Turkey, the government adjusted the minimum excise-specific tax, effective January 1, we took the pricing a bit ahead of that. So, all these prices appear in the quarter clearly. There is nothing exceptional, it's in the normal course of things, okay.","I think the pricing was more or less the same across segments in absolute terms in the majority of the market. So, there's no any particular opening of (35:50) that I can think about, and we have not seen elasticities changing. However, the only thing we need to observe now is Turkey, because in Turkey, if you take the beginning of 2016 to the end, we took TRY 3 per pack price increase, which is around 30% plus average and Turkey grew also because of the reduction of the contraband volume last year especially in the half of the year.","So, we can expect a little bit of weaknesses, I would assume, given that magnitude of price increases. And I think we will recover as the year unfolds, that's at second half, but we will see softness in the first part of the year. But that's all I can say about this whole thing.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then I wanted to go back to something on your guidance that you mentioned, I just wanted to be clear. So, your guidance assumes that IQOS in total will still be breakeven. I think that's what you mentioned at your Investor Day, so I just wanted to clarify that. And then wanted to understand your plans for spending by IQOS or behind IQOS this year. And then maybe help us quantify how big of an increase you're anticipating, if you could do that.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. Yes, IQOS will breakeven towards the end of next year. If you remember \u2013 I'm sorry, this...","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Wait. Okay...","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","We're still in (37:31) in 2016.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","I'm sorry about that.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","No, no.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","This year, okay, and we still have significant capacity constraints in the third quarter, if you remember.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","And then we have a very aggressive capacity build-up plan. And clearly, the whole volume is going to be skewed towards the second half of the year. This is also the reason that the first quarter is going to be probably the weakest in the year because we don't have the capacity but many European markets, for example, and others, are making all the investments ahead of the deployment in the first quarter and second quarter.","So, that's how I see it unfolding during the year. And these are substantial incremental investments I can't quantify, but they're very substantial. The increment is much higher than this year. Okay.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just my final question, I'd be curious to hear from you guys the feedback you've been receiving from public health experts and then governments around the world given the success you've had with IQOS and the science you've been publishing. Anything you can share with us regarding conversations and progress you're making would really be helpful. Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Look, I can comment generally, and I also have direct contacts with a number of people. I think there is a positive momentum building, okay, and I must say faster than I personally anticipated. Now, as you know very well, there are still people that have not embraced the principle of harm reduction of the product and that will continue requiring a significant amount of work going forward. But I believe the trend is very positive and I'm very happy with the progress we're making. Okay. I'm not saying there will be no hurdles. I'm not saying there is not going to be difficulties. But I think the way we are received and the science is received is positive, very positive.","Bonnie L. Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi. Thank you. I just had a couple of questions for you, if I could. The first, and I hope this is not a repeat of earlier questions, but you talked about shifting resources from combustibles to RRPs, and I know you're probably trying to find the right balance across many of those markets. I'm thinking like a market like Japan, can you talk about how resources have shifted if that's a percentage or some measurement of that to explain how that shifts from one to the other?","And then just to be clear, I'm sorry if I missed it, have you said how much your costs are up in 2017 and would that be inclusive of RRP investments?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. On your first question, okay, first of all, the allocation \u2013 the reallocation is done on the relevant market. We are not reducing resources in a market where we don't plan to launch RRPs and put them behind the RRPs. And the explanation is the allocation is based on the fact that, as I said in Investors Day, we try to get as fast as possible to the 2% or 3% market share that we believe is the tipping point to go from linear (40:48) expansion to exponential growth of IQOS because then, the consumers or the adopters of IQOS become the ambassadors of the product and the brand.","So, it's market-specific and the amount of reallocation you do is also based on the competitive environment, the consumer dynamics and so on and so forth. So, there is no rule of thumb. And I don't remember exactly how much money we reallocated in Japan, but there has been a significant shift of things that are very measurable like your direct marketing budget.","But also that's where it becomes a little bit more difficult, it's how really the time of a field force that exists is allocated between the two categories. Okay. In many markets, as I said, you need incremental ground forces during the initial period well and above the field forces we have. Because we've seen very clearly that the more people you put on the ground, the faster the reaction, as we see in Italy now, as we see in Switzerland now, more resources. In Italy, we've doubled the market share in just 10 weeks because now we have the resources on the ground. So, that's the rule of thumb.","Now, as of the overall costs, clearly in 2017, we will be above our 1% to 3% more or less target because of all these deployments. Okay. So, the cost \u2013 but they're all in the guidance, by the way.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Chris, we have said \u2013 it's Jacek here, we have said that we look to grow the revenues above the 6% or the upper-end of the current (42:45) and clearly still we're lifting EPS. So, you could see that we are not diluting the margins. I think we should look for the year when we will have a small but still the margin expansion operating profit margin expansion, not to the tune which we had in 2016.","Andr\u00e9 mentioned that there is a device sales in this revenue and, for a time being, they yield a negative margin. So, that's obviously dilutive. But the HeatSticks, and still the performance of the combustibles were both (43:18) 6% pricing. I mean, that should allow us for some margin expansion, say 10, 20 basis points, and we will see how the year unfolds.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just one other follow-up question, if I could, which is that, if you were able to get approval as a Modified Risk Tobacco Product in the U.S. in 2017, I'm just curious what that would mean to you in other international markets, in Japan? I'm obviously getting to \u2013 could you make a, or would you make, a claim and would that, for some reason, cause you to accelerate your investments in IQOS?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay, Chris. First of all, it is highly unlikely we will get approval for MRTP in 2017.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. As you know, the FDA gave a guidance that they would \u2013 may take X-days, but I mean that may take more time. What we believe is more within the 2017 realm, is the product authorization for the U.S. market without claims, okay. And we will submit that application, the PMTA application, in the first quarter this year, okay.","Now, irrespective of the approval in the U.S. \u2013 the FDA approval obviously helps the credibility internationally, but it doesn't apply to Japan, okay.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","In Japan and other markets, our claim structure, as we said, follows the local legislation, but also the conclusion of our own science. So, what we communicate to the consumers is driven by local laws and our own science. And the FDA cannot be applied to these places. But, obviously, it will add credibility to their entire scientific dossier, and that's why it is important to us.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you for your time.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Co.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Hi, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. So, I was hoping to get a little bit more color on your go-to-market execution on IQOS for some of the newer markets that you've entered, perhaps Canada. If you could comment on the excise tax structure, retail footprint, and relative pricing versus combustibles? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. First of all, the first variable is clearly what marketing freedoms you have. Okay. What we learned, as I said for many markets, is in the initial phase, unless \u2013 until you get this critical mass, you need the right amount of people on the ground that talk to the consumers, explain the product, and help the consumers in the conversion.","And as a general principle, as of this year, we will start introducing digital tools to \u2013 we are a little bit too manual and labor-intensive and we'll introduce, where the law allows, digital tools to help the conversion.","And that is something we'll do everywhere, but the speed by which IQOS switching occurs depends also on the freedoms we have in the market. In Canada, you have very limited ability to communicate with consumers under the current regime. So Canada is going to take some time, okay.","Clearly, the tax we received is more favorable than the tax levy on cigarettes in Canada. And pricing, I don't exactly remember, because depends on the State of Canada in which we go. But I think, in any case, we will be at the premium end of the market, okay. I think we're, yeah, we're premium like Belmont price. But in Canada, it varies from state \u2013 province to province, so I can't make a general comment. Okay. Did I answer your question?","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","You did. Thank you. And if I could just follow up, so of the 20 markets, is there any market where you have not gotten a favorable tax treatment?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","No.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very good.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Jacek is the underlying factor (47:46).","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just one on the combustibles, if I could. In the EU, you guys called out the kind of anniversarying of a benefit from immigration as well as illicit. How do we think about kind of full-year industry volumes for the EU? And I think you called out some softness on the comps in the first half. But order of magnitude, how much is one-half versus two halves going to differ, do you think? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","For the moment, we assume that EU will go to its secular 2% to 3% decline rate this year. Okay, last year, we assumed the same, we had a positive surprise. But logically, it should go there, because we don't have the one-offs of immigration and so on. And, yes, the employment is getting better in Europe. The outlook in GDP growth is moderately better. But when you look at the whole thing, I have to assume, at this stage, 2% to 3% decline, okay, that's what we're working with.","Now, just for you (48:55) on this quarter comparison, don't forget that in European Union countries, we have the implementation of the Tobacco Product Directive. And there are cutoff days for certain products, for 10s, for 20s, for 19s (49:07), so it has been a little bit of a rocky thing with trade loadings and unloadings, which should ease now as we move into this year, okay.","So, yes, there will be some unfavorable comparisons at the beginning of the year, but that's how I see EU. We'll see as the year unfolds.","Vivien Azer - Cowen & Co. LLC","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to touch on the Philippines. We know, about a week or two ago, your local competitor took some pricing, and you took pricing in the fourth quarter on Marlboro. Mix has been a big driver there, obviously, lifting Marlboro's share up. What do price gaps look like now, and can you sustain that trading-up momentum over the course of this year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Look, our major competitor increased prices but they are implementing also some discounting schemes, so we still need to see the prices flowing through to the market, okay?. Plus, as you know, there are still a lot of non-tax-paid volumes and fake stamps on the market. But I'm very encouraged that the government seems to start moving in this direction but still we need to see it happening.","Now, we increased the price of Marlboro and the per-stick price is theoretically PHP 3.50. In some places, it went up to PHP 4. We have to assume there will be some impact on Marlboro initially but, so far, it looks better than what we anticipate. So, I think the up-trading may stop for a while at the beginning, but it will continue over time because still, the price gaps are very attractive. Okay.","The big problem in the Philippines that we had in 2016, in terms of low-end of the market volumes, will continue. Because with the implementation of our price increase, per-stick prices still went up at the bottom end and these are pretty substantial increases for low-income consumers.","The good news is we don't see smoking incidence decrease, but we see a decrease in sticks per day, which means that once we get up stability now that we got the excise tax kind of convergence of the tiers done, I hope that over time, probably towards the end of this year, we'll start seeing some stability, and then daily consumption will start coming up to the previous level.","But we have to assume conservatively, at least for the Philippines, the trend is not going to change in terms of volume for the year.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then on IQOS, you've touched on some of the capacity constraints. Sorry if I missed this. Can you just revisit \u2013 I believe you've been saying you thought that those capacity constraints would ease at the end of this quarter. Is that still the case?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Yes. But we start the year with 15 billion installed capacity which, if everything goes right, that gives you, mathematically, the equivalent of 1.2 billion per month, okay. And we'll ramp up the capacity to 50 billion at the year-end, but the average for the year is something around 32 billion given all these machines that are being installed assuming the plan goes into perfection. So, that's basically a variable. So, we'll have some constraints still in the first quarter, obviously. And we'll start getting more capacity as we move on, and we'll have the max capacity, obviously, in the fourth quarter of the year. And that will dictate, obviously, the pace of sales as well.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","We talked to consumers in Korea and Hong Kong who are getting product from Japan, obviously, because you haven't launched there yet. But do you expect to move into those markets sooner than later? Do you have any sense of what timing that might look like?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Yes, we have a plan, obviously.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","There are more markets where consumers are getting the product from other places, so...","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay. So, yes, I think Korea has very good potential given the characteristics of consumers and the market and, eventually, we'll be in this markets. But you appreciate I can't say exactly when.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","No. That makes sense. And then just one last one on Indonesia. We've seen the leaf crop there this year be hurt by bad weather. It looks like it's set to rebound very strongly next year. I know you have some ability to smooth \u2013 you at least have big inventories in leaf stocks. How much can you smooth any potential impact from the expensive leaf that might be coming through now? Is that any headwind there or do you have different ways to offset that?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","It's more of the cloves (54:12) than leaf \u2013 the leaf as well. I think we are able to amortize these shocks now because we have sufficient inventory. It's a bit tighter on the leaf, a bit better on the cloves (54:24), which...","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of Berenberg.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. A couple of few questions, if I can, just a little quick accounting one. When you put in the $733 million of sales, is that counting all of the IQOS, HeatSticks devices at full price with the discounts going through as cost of sales? Or is that actually the sort of net realizations?","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","It's the net realization. Discounts go into consumers and the trade will be deducted from obviously from the revenues. You have on a net basis net after allowances.","Jonathan Leinster - Joh. Berenberg, Gossler & Co. KG (United Kingdom)","Okay. And just out of interest on the sort of (55:10) fourth quarter sales, how much of that was actually do you think sold on a discount.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","It depends by the market. There are different schemes. Devices, they were all sold at the promotional price, on a discount. And the HeatSticks, you will have to go market by market, and the different stages, they might run different schemes. Usually, market at the beginning will have some small discount on the HeatSticks and then depends on the market situation, I mean, at the full price of cigarette price (55:43)...","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","It's mostly full price. In many markets you can't even discount the HeatSticks. It's illegal by legislation. So, it's mostly discounts.","Jacek Olczak - Philip Morris International, Inc.","The (55:54) from the devices.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","It's the devices and that's why I caution everybody not to take this to the bottom line straight at the same margin as the rest because it's negative. But it pays off very quickly. It's pretty obvious. I mean, it...","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","And then just today the French sort of put out their price list today and obviously there has been some big tax increases going through. And yourself and one of your big competitors didn't change prices at all. What's the thinking behind that?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","Look, I cannot comment on pricing. You appreciate that. The only thing I can tell you is in France, given the structure of the excise tax that is all ad valorem essentially, it's not a big deal because the trade-off between volume and pricing is very often neutral. And that's the only comment I can make at least temporarily.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","I thought it was a turnover tax on the actual companies...","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","...which works like an ad valorem component.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos - Philip Morris International, Inc.","The turnover of the distributors net of excise taxes, that boils down to a pass-on of around \u20ac0.18.","Michael Lavery - CLSA Americas LLC","\u20ac0.18?

Please go ahead, Sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the first quarter 2014, and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are PMI estimates based on the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources.","Net revenues exclude excise taxes, operating companies' income, or OCI, is defined as operating income excluding general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries net. OCI growth rates are on an adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs.","Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It's now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our business results in the first quarter are in line with the 2014 annual guidance that we shared with you in February. The quarter was impacted by a number of distortions that marked a much better performance at the net revenue and OCI level.","Our business fundamentals remain solid and we are making progress in addressing the issues that we highlighted in February. Today we are increasing our reported diluted earnings per share guidance for 2014 at prevailing exchange rate to a range of $5.09 to $5.19, versus $5.26 in 2013.","Our revised guidance includes $0.61 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rate, compared to the $0.71 previously disclosed and a $0.03 restructuring charge related to the closure of our manufacturing facility in Australia.","We have taken $0.01 of this charge this quarter to cover the cost of employee separation and expect to subsequently incur an estimated $0.02 of additional anticipated restructuring charges.","Our 2014 guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency and this restructuring charge of approximately 6% to 8% compared to our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.40 in 2013.","During the first quarter, cigarette volume declined by 4.4% driven primarily by total industry volume contraction and unfavorable inventory movement. We estimate that absent this inventory distortions, our underlying volume was down by around 2%.","Net revenues and adjusted OCI, both excluding currency, declined by 1.6% and 3.1%, respectively. The lower revenues and OCI were attributable to Japan and the Philippines, both of which were also impacted by timing distortions.","Net revenues and OCI, excluding these unfavorable distortions, as well as the impact of the change to PMI\u2019s new business structure in Egypt, were essentially stable. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased by 4.7%, excluding currency.","Pricing was the key driver of our solid performance and a key reason why profits were impacted by a difficult year-on-year comparison. Our pricing variance reached $406 million in the first quarter of 2014, compared to $531 million during the same period last year when we benefited from favorable pricing related to inventory movements in a number of markets, and in particular in the Philippines following the very large January 2013 excise tax increase.","Since December of last year, we have taken price increases in a wide range of markets, including Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, Turkey and the U.K. We recently announced to the trade in Germany that we will take a 20 Euro cent per pack price increase in June, essentially across our entire cigarette portfolio.","Let me now turn to an update on key regions and markets. In the EU Region, we witnessed a 5.6% decline in cigarette industry volume, in line with the decrease that occurred during the second half of last year. This confirms a moderation in the unfavorable trend, despite persistently high unemployment levels.","We attribute this moderation to an apparent overall stabilization in illicit trade during 2013, a significant slow-down in the growth of e-vapor products in many markets and reduced down-trading to fine cut products. However, we should remember that the comparisons with 2013 are easier in the first half of this year.","Consequently, we still forecast that cigarette industry volume may decline within a range of 6% to 7% for the full year 2014, though we expect it to be closer to 6% than 7%.","We continue to outperform the industry in the EU Region. Our regional market share increased by 0.9 points in the first quarter to 38.9%. We achieved share growth in five out of the six largest markets in the region and expect our momentum to continue throughout the year.","Our strong share performance is driven by the strength of our key international brands. Marlboro gained 0.4 points to reach a 19.1% regional share despite continued weak consumer purchasing power. L&M grew by 0.3 share points to 6.9% and Chesterfield performed particularly well, gaining 0.6 points in the quarter to reach a regional share of 4.9%.","In the first quarter, cigarette industry volume in Italy remained very resilient with a decline of just 0.5%. This is attributable to a significant decline in the sales of e-vapor products, a stabilization of illicit trade and lower fine cut volumes.","The key issue in Italy is the ineffective excise tax structure. The country has the lowest specific-to-total excise tax ratio in the EU at 7.5%. This has encouraged competitors to introduce or re-position brands to the super-low \u20ac4 per pack price segment and has resulted in an increase in the price gap to premium brands to \u20ac1 per pack, which is a much wider gap than in markets such as France and Germany.","Consequently, the super-low segment grew from 0.5% in the first quarter of last year to 11.9% this year, driven predominantly by down-trading from the low and mid-price segments, as well as in-switching from e-vapor products.","We successfully entered the super-low segment this year by repositioning Chesterfield, which has already grown by 1.5 points to reach a level of 5.1% in the first quarter, while Marlboro\u2019s share remained resilient at 25.6%.","In 2013, the State incurred a decrease in excise tax revenues for the first time in over a decade and the decline accelerated in the first quarter. We therefore hope that the government will soon address the issue of excise tax reform.","Let me now move to the Asia Region. As foreseen, the Japanese government increased the consumption tax from 5% to 8% on April 1. The resulting pass-on at retail was about JPY14 per pack. We received approval to increase our average retail prices only in line with the tax increase.","As previously mentioned, we expect a slight acceleration in the rate of decline in cigarette industry volume from last year\u2019s level of 2% to between 3% and 3.5%, due to the impact of the consumption tax-driven price increases on the overall economy.","During the first quarter of this year, however, cigarette industry volume increased by 9.6% in Japan, driven by trade and consumer purchases ahead of the April tax-driven price increases. Our volume during this period was 9.1% lower, principally due to the adverse timing of PMI shipments and a lower market share.","Our reported market share declined by two points to 25.5% during the first quarter. However, this partly reflected the greater degree of trade inventory build-up by competition, which distorted market shares. Our estimated share of 25.9% on an adjusted basis was in line with our 2013 fourth quarter share.","During the quarter, we rolled-out the \u201cBe Marlboro\u201d marketing campaign that has been an integral part of the brand\u2019s success in European and other markets. The initial feedback has been very positive.","We believe that this campaign, along with Marlboro\u2019s resilience and our future new product initiatives, should enable us to stabilize our share and eventually generate sequential gains.","Let me now move to the Philippines, where tax-paid cigarette industry volume increased by 25.9% during the first quarter. This was mainly due to a lower build-up of inventories by the trade at the end of 2013 compared to the same period in 2012, due to a more moderate excise tax increase in January 2014.","There are strong indications that Mighty Corporation continues to declare about half of its production volume for tax purposes. The company is coming under increasing scrutiny from the Bureau of Internal Revenue. We hope that the introduction of tax stamps in June will further reinforce these efforts.","While the price of the Mighty brand has gone up at retail from PHP1 to PHP1.50 per stick, Marvels still retails at PHP1.25 per stick and currently wholesales at a price that does not cover the full taxes due.","We have responded with Jackpot at the same stick price as Marvels and Champion matching Mighty, while maintaining the price of Fortune slightly below PHP2 per stick.","We were able to reach a share of the super-low price segment of over 50% in the first quarter. Our overall market share of 83.7% was higher than both our 2013 full-year and fourth quarter shares, but lower than our share in the first quarter of 2013.","Importantly, the total share of the super-low price segment has been declining recently. Going forward, the price increases that have occurred at the bottom of the market and our marketing efforts behind Marlboro and Fortune should enable us to further improve our market share and product mix trends.","In Indonesia, during the first quarter of the year, cigarette industry volume declined by 1% and there was an acceleration of certain segment trends. The industry volume decline was driven by a sharp contraction of the low-price segment, which was down by 12.7%.","This was attributable to the impact of Decree 131, the legislation that eliminated the preferential excise tax for so-called \u201csister companies\u201d of large manufacturers, which resulted in significantly higher prices for a wide range of brands at the low end of the market.","In addition, the reduction in fuel subsidies last year and food inflation significantly impacted low-income adult smokers. In the quarter, this particularly benefited the mid-price segment, where we have a strong position with U Mild, which gained 1.1 points to reach a share of 5.2%.","Although inflation has increased and the overall economic situation has somewhat softened, GDP growth remains over 5%. This, together with the positive demographic trends and the overall stable political environment, leads us to forecast total market growth of up to 1% in Indonesia for the full-year.","During the first quarter, our market share in Indonesia declined by 1.6 share points to 34.6%, reflecting unfavorable price points and the impact of segment trends.","There was an acceleration in the decline in the hand-rolled, or \u201cSKT\u201d segment, which incurred a volume erosion of 16.1% in the quarter. The decline was particularly evident at the premium price end of the segment and this unfavorably impacted the volume and overall share of our Dji Sam Soe brand.","While we have lost segment share in SKT due to an unfavorable price point for Dji Sam Soe and a widening in the brand\u2019s price gap with competitive brands, PMI is performing well in the other taste segments.","We will be investing more heavily this year to further boost the equity of brands, such as machine-made Sampoerna A, Dji Sam Soe Magnum. We therefore expect an improved market share performance during the second half of the year.","I will now turn to Russia, where profit growth remains strong despite the impact of large tax-driven price increases.","Cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 6.7% in the first quarter to 66.9 billion units though announced price increases of RUB6 to RUB9 per pack only started to impact adult smokers as of February 2014.","For the full-year, we are forecasting an industry volume decline of between 9% and 11%, mainly reflecting the impact of higher prices and a foreseen increase in illicit trade, this despite the growing efforts of the authorities to stamp out counterfeit production and stop the import of contraband and illicit whites.","Our brand performance in the first quarter was strong. Our market share of 26.7% through the end of February was up by 0.5 points versus a year earlier and up by 0.4 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.","Our segment share was higher in the premium and low-price segments, notably behind the success of Parliament and Bond Street.","Our profits in the quarter grew at a double-digit rate, excluding currency and this is before the contribution of our 20% shareholding in Megapolis, an investment that is bringing about gradual improvements in our market penetration as well as providing an attractive financial return. We remain optimistic about the prospects for our business this year and beyond in Russia.","Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, our share in the first quarter of 2014 declined by 0.2 points to 36.5%, driven notably by a lower share in Indonesia and Japan, but largely offset by our strong performance in the EU Region.","Marlboro has been a key driver of our good share performance. During the first quarter, Marlboro progressed to reach an international share of 9.2%. It gained share in three out of our four regions, with a particularly strong performance in the EU region.","Its share decline in the Latin America and Canada region reflects consumer down-trading and distorted shipment patterns in Mexico, while the brand performed well in other markets in the region.","We continue to be focused on costs and productivity to further drive the expansion of our profits. We have an annual cost savings and productivity target of $300 million this year. We have implemented a number of initiatives across our supply chain to achieve this objective.","We are also continuing to optimize our global footprint and announced the closure at the end of this year of our manufacturing facility in Melbourne, Australia. Production will be consolidated in our factory in South Korea.","We have entered into consultations with employee representatives in the Netherlands on a proposal to discontinue cigarette production at our Bergen op Zoom facility. The proposal is subject to consultation with the Dutch Works Council and approval by the Philip Morris Holland Supervisory Board. Consultation with the European Works Council is also required.","Subject to the final outcome of the consultations and fulfillment of certain other conditions, we would anticipate to implement the contemplated decision by October 2014.","We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Our target dividend pay-out ratio remains an attractive 65% and our dividend yield last Friday was 4.5%.","During the first quarter, we spent $1.25 billion to repurchase 15.4 million shares at an average price of $81.12 and are targeting to spend $4 billion during the full-year.","In conclusion, our guidance reflects a full-year growth rate of approximately 6% to 8% in an adjusted diluted earnings per share excluding currency and the restructuring charge. Our overall business is in good shape though the unfavorable volume mix remains a key challenge due to cigarette industry volume trends. Our performance in the EU region is improving with our leading brands all gaining market share.","Furthermore, trends in the first quarter confirm the slight moderation in cigarette industry volume decline. We're starting to see signs of stabilization in our underlying share performance in Japan and the Philippines.","The accelerated decline of the hand-rolled segment and unfavorable price point in Indonesia have impacted our overall market share, but we're performing well in the machine-made segment. We are growing share and profit in Russia and our business across the EEMA region is performing well.","Our pricing remains the key driver of our performance. This is being complemented by cost savings and productivity programs.","Finally, we're ramping up our organization ahead of our exciting city tests later this year and our first national commercial launch in 2015 of reduced-risk products. This is the term we use to refer to products that have the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm.","We will complete our eight clinical trials this year and are continuing our perception and behavioral studies. We're preparing the packaging and the labeling of the products and as previously stated, the increased investments this year will be around $100 million.","Finally, we're moving forward with the constructions of a 30 billion unit HeatStick tobacco stick factory in Bologna, Italy, which will be completed by 2016.","Thank you. And I will be now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the teleconference.

Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Thanks, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning Judy.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Jacek, just Japan. I'm trying to reconcile the 9% decline in your shipments in the second quarter and the inventory movement that we saw, the market share losses. Can you just bridge sort of that 9% decline for Japan in the quarter?","And then as you think about then the upcoming quarter, do we then see some of that benefit? So you actually would see a positive shipment in Japan as you flow through the inventory movement the other way?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we have two things for Japan. One is, as we said, our in-market sales actually for the quarter was about 300 million units higher than the first quarter of last year. This was still a little bit lower participation in the trade purchases ahead of the price increases than our principal competitors and our share panel will be the lower on the reported basis and on a restated or adjusted basis, we think it was flat versus Q4 last year.","Our shipment and this is how we recognize the revenue on the market, essentially the purchases by our distributors to Japan, so this is one step lower than the in-market sales and the shipments to the distributor were lower by about 1.3 billion units and this is where the distortions, which we have for Japan.","When it comes to the next quarters, I mean although we see the market to go down for the full year in the range of 3% to 3.5%, the question is how much trade we'll need to be stock or unwind the higher purchases which have happened at the end of the last quarter.","So, I don't think we should have that magnitude of the inventory adjustment and also obviously there is a function of how our shares is going to develop going forward.","I mean so far we see the first two quarters sequentially when our share comes flat. I mean if that obviously would remain for the remaining part of the year, we would have a much less of the distortions on the shipment.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Okay. And just on that note, so the underlying market share performance, Jacek, you sound like you're seeing a little bit of stabilization there and maybe cautiously optimistic that things will improve as the year progresses. Can you just give us some color just in terms of what's driving that confidence at this point?","Jacek Olczak","We're encouraged -- as I said, on an adjusted basis, the share came flat versus Q4. So, this is the first sequential quarters which we have over the last good few quarters when we have not lost share. And Marlboro came relatively strong. L&M and Lark continues to be under pressure. There is a program in place to address the Lark performance.","And I think also the Be Marlboro campaign, which we started to roll out in Japan in Q1 of this year will get the very positive response at the consumer level. So, we start the number of parameters or brand attributes which the campaign has helped us to address in the other regions, mainly the European region.","We start seeing the same sort of an impact in Japan. Preparedly, when the campaign is rolled out, but this is even more encouraging. So, let's stay cautiously optimistic for the year, but this is still the long way for us to fully stabilize or to return to growth in the Japanese market.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Okay. And then secondly, just on Indonesia, just a market share movement there. You called out unfavorable price points. Can you just talk about what drove that unfavorable price point? And then how you're addressing that issue?","And how would you characterize your performance in Indonesia in the context of some of the other markets like Japan or the Philippines where obviously you have had some market share challenges? Is this a little bit more one-off situation, or what do you think about the market share performance in Indonesia and how you think about that going forward?","Jacek Olczak","I think there are two factors which, first of all impacted the total industry, impacting the industry performance. One is some sort of a pressure coming still from the last year, the median removal partially of the fuel subsidies, some pressure on inflation, so it has an impact on the total market, especially on the lower price points. I mean this is what the consumers presumably are most impacted by that pressure from their disposable income.","Second thing is the market had an underlying trend of the consumer switching from hand-rolled cigarettes to machine-made cigarettes. Obviously, we present in those segments, but our main brand, Dji Sam Soe, is the hand-made kretek cigarette.","That brand sit at premium price point of the segment, actually, it is one of the most expensive brands in the market. The brands we started to sell after the price increases last year as of about mid of last year, the brand price per pack was about IDR12,000 for the pack of 12. So, we crossed at the retail level the stick price of IDR1,000.","Other main competitors behind us in terms of the price gap. So, I think it's going to take some time until they will cross the market will cross that price point with another brand. I would expect some moderations in the share pressure in Indonesia in the second half of the year and we just have to be patient.","We also are addressing the consumer taste preferences going for the machine -- from the hand-made cigarettes to machine-made by line extending Dji Sam Soe.","So, we have two very well -- one very well performing variant and we are coming with the second variant, Dji Sam Soe Magnum, which is a filter kretek machine-made -- machine-made kretek cigarette. So, I think the share, -- I mean overall, I think we can get to the decent share performance, but we have to wait a little bit.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi David.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","First a broader question, Jacek. So this quarter local currency, OCI was down 3, EPS was up 5. How do you envision the balance of the year unfolding? Clearly the results need to be better than this to hit the full year target.","Jacek Olczak","The OCI, on an ex-currency basis for the full year should be -- should obviously have a positive growth","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Right.","Jacek Olczak","Otherwise it will be difficult to get to the 6% to 8% on the EPS level, ex-currency obviously.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And\u2026","Jacek Olczak","You need to note into this thing that this distortion which we had on a shipment basis this year, I'm sorry in the first quarter, I mean at April 3rd, the pressure on the overall OCI growth. But as I said in my remarks, if I would exclude the distortions which we have had in the first quarter, my revenues and OCI would be flattish -- at least flattish for the quarter on ex-currency basis.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then second, Jacek, what are you seeing in the market in Russia now that the price increases are starting to come through at retail?","Jacek Olczak","It's very still early because the prices have started to appear at the retail level around second half of February. I think as in the past we were at the beginning of the price changes in Philip Morris, the competition I can see that the following.","There is one competitor, which is slow, but they usually were slow. So I think we need still a few weeks to see the full impact on the market. The market was less than 7%, 6.7% diluted down for the quarter. We still hold the forecast for the full year for the full market to be in a decline rate of 9% to 11%.","One thing which we have to watch that the current situation with the ruble having some pressure, GDP growth forecast for Russia is coming a little bit lower than the previous forecast.","I mean the whole situation around that region is a little bit -- not extremely helpful, so we just have to see how this going to unfold during the year. But as our forecast for the market is at the 9% to 11% decline, we don't see actually that we should revise anything else in our estimate for the year -- for this year at this stage.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","I just have -- my first question a quick follow-on on Japan. Given the expected price increases in the market, how much do you think this will increase the total profit pool? And then do you envision capturing I guess more than your fair share over the next few years?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I can talk about this year, as you know, we have ended up and what I see generally the industry has ended up with price increase which essentially just passed on the VAT increase, so I don't see much of the profit pool enhancement in the market.","If you deduct the estimated market decline for the year actually coming slightly negative rather than a positive that's for this year; and I think talking about the outer year would be a clear speculation because we also need to see what is the decision of the government with regards to the planned second step of the sales price increase from 8% to 10%.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's fair. And then, my second question is on Marlboro. The volume performance was relatively weak during the quarter. So I guess in light of this, could you talk a little bit about Marlboro 2.0, the next generation brand, and how this might reaccelerate growth for total Marlboro? And then, possibly which markets Marlboro has the most opportunity or upside this year?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we post -- essentially post the test market in a few locations for the Marlboro 2.0 architecture. All tests, all three locations reported very encouraging results. I mean the perception of the Marlboro Red really start changing. This is what the brand needed.","We think this is the right thing to do to reinvigorate Marlboro Red and somehow replicated I think a tremendous success which we have achieved with the Marlboro Gold a few years ago when we revamped Marlboro gold.","So I think it's overall the move in the right directions. We will be rolling results sequentially in the number of markets. To actually give you a one single out one or group of markets where Marlboro have the best of the potential, if I am looking at the last couple of years Marlboro performance, frankly speaking, Marlboro has the potential in every geography.","And I think the Marlboro performance in the Europe against all of this negative macroeconomic trend is just confirming that the brand can serve the very stormy waters irregardless of the situation. The brand is and I think is going to be then in a better shape than it used to be in the past.","So I will not volunteer to single one market when a Marlboro would benefit. Obviously, we can talk about the Russia, but Marlboro Russia is more than just the Marlboro architecture, it's the product propositions and a couple of other factors.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. That's helpful. And then, my final question is on your dividend. Given your negative EPS growth this year due primarily, of course, to the currency headwind, could you share with us how you're thinking about your dividend? And then, how comfortable or willing you are to let your payout ratio be above your target 65%?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we're currently above the current ratio -- sorry, the current payout ratio. Listen, the divined, as you know, is the decision of our Board, so I think we need to be patient and wait until the September Board and see what decision the Board will make.","What I can say at this stage is that I think we have in every single year since we become independent; we've been rewarding shareholders irregardless of some headwinds which we had on our reported result. And I can't say anything more at this stage, but I think we had a track record of generously rewarding shareholders.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. Good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi. I just had two questions for you. I wanted to ask a little bit more detail on the EU. I just noticed -- and I don't recall seeing this of late -- but that the Marlboro brand was down in the quarter but you had growth in L&M, Chesterfield, the Philip Morris brand, more mid-tier type brands.","Was there any change in, sort of the mix, if you will, the product mix in that market, anything that worried you about any kind of trading down in some markets?","Jacek Olczak","No. I think that L&M continues to perform well in all markets. Actually L&M total share and Marlboro share was pretty strong -- came strong in the many markets. You have -- and I think Marlboro actually for the quarter went up by the four times of a point if I'm not mistaken, okay in the segment, in the EU segment.","Chesterfield had a bit of acceleration. I think Italy has contributed to that. We had some situation in Italy when the former euro price segment has doubled up was the end of the last year.","I mean I have said it in my remarks the tax system in Italy is pretty inefficient. Actually I would characterize it as one of the most inefficient systems within the European Union region.","We have entered the segment by repositioning Chesterfield. The brand picked up very nicely, so I think it also contributed to the overall performance of Chesterfield.","And I think in other larger market volume-wise when the Chesterfield picked up very nicely, I think recently was Poland, but I don't think it's much of the mix. All brands across the price -- irregardless of the price segment positioning are delivering a very strong share growth.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Thank you. And I just had a follow-up question for you on the Philippines as well. I guess just to be clear; there was another tax increase at the start of the year. So it seemed like across at least some of your volume, you are absorbing that today? Have you taken pricing may be on Marlboro, but not on Fortune or Jackpot, or one of the lower-priced brands?","Jacek Olczak","No. We have fact that we need to restore the competitiveness and put our grip on all key price points in the market, and this entailed that we have to absorb the tax. And then if Marlboro continues selling at the equivalent of the PHP1 per stick. Fortune, we're now trading I think at the retail at the slightly below the PHP2.","And we have much the key brands of Mighty, our key competitor there with the Marlboro and it's always the Jackpot and Champion. And I think this is very much behind our market share performance, but the part of our strategy and we have made it very clear, I believe, as of November or so last year that we need to regain our competitiveness in the market. And one of the key elements of restoring the sort of a level playing field I think also in this market.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","I had a related question then which is, you're chasing some of this really low-end volume, very unprofitable, or maybe not at all profitable volume. Is there a view that you could then trade that consumer up in the future, or that you'll benefit if you hold onto that share as prices go higher? Is that the viewpoint, or is it better to manage for profitability given your already high share?","Jacek Olczak","That's exactly the plan.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. Got you. Thanks so much for your time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster of UBS.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Hi. Good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Jon Leinster - UBS","A couple of questions. First of all, on the underlying volume growth down 2%, which inventory distortions are you including? Because it seemed to me the Philippines is probably the largest swing, is that not included in that sort of underlying 2% down?","Jacek Olczak","No. I think the major would come from Japan. And you will have some movement across the number of the markets. I think there was Russia slightly contributing in the things. Yeah, this would be the main one.","Jon Leinster - UBS","So it doesn't include the impact of the Philippines, which was a sort of positive sort of move?","Jacek Olczak","No.","Jon Leinster - UBS","No. Okay. And the big question on pricing, you mentioned obviously the inventory movements added a lot to pricing in the first quarter of 2013 and that's not going to recur. So could we assume therefore that pricing for 2014 in general, the overall mix, the variance, is likely to prove to be less than 2013?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think we had very a high pricing variance last year to some extent it\u2019s driven also by the one-off in Bolivia and the Philippines, right? So, that thing will not repeat, if you like, this year. But if I compare apples-to-apples, frankly speaking the pricing variance this year we don\u2019t see why this shouldn\u2019t be in line with our historical average sort of annual pricing variance.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Right. Okay. And usually you make some comment about how much of the pricing you've already got through in terms of the market. Is that something you are prepared to comment on at the moment?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we have now made some advancement versus what we have announced in February. So we\u2019re approaching much higher number, and frankly speaking there wasn\u2019t \u2013 we have more advancement in terms of announced and realized pricing than we had in February.","Jon Leinster - UBS","And very quickly, lastly; is there any signs that the Italian government is actually moving on the tax system?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think the decline in the governmental tax revenues in the last year and a continuing for Q1 is something that I believe makes the government looking more closely, I mean, what have led to the situation.","As I said, the system is inefficient. It\u2019s very heavily \u2013 most heavily in the European Union scaled towards ad valorem component and many other markets also during the crisis.","If you look at Spain to some extent, not fully, but France \u2013 I mean, that is typical of high ad valorem markets, they have recognized the weakness of the structure and the system and they have moved ahead.","I believe, Italian government will -- is closely looking and they will reach the same conclusion that the more specific component is actually better system also from the revenue, the governmental revenues perspective.","Jon Leinster - UBS","But is there actually a proposal out there for any movement, or is that yet to come?","Jacek Olczak","I think there are some discussions.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Back to Indonesia, I just wanted to try to see if I could clarify a little bit or understand it better. My understanding is that Djarum Super and Gudang Garam International have also hit those same price points.","I think it was late in the quarter so obviously it wouldn't have had much impact in these numbers, but just in terms of the outlook for the rest of the year, is the issue that there is a segment shift away from their brands and Dji Sam Soe because of the higher price point, or is it that those two are gaining from you and that you should be able to get some of that back, or how does that work?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think their price point has \u2013is one of the key elements to play there. As I said, I mean, Dji Sam Soe now, I mean most of the packs sold in the market at 13,000 rupiah per pack of 12.","So, I mean, clearly we are well above the 1 rupiah price point and retailers try to even round up that price to 1,500 if not more. While the Djarum and the GG, I think, if I not mistaking, the key brand competing with Dji Sam Soe now still have sums volumes below 12,000 and I would think about the half of the volumes \u2013 maybe slightly more than half of the volumes at the 12,000 per pack.","So they are just now hitting the sum around price point. I think, the issue is the market when you have a pretty frequent sort of a pricing increase. So I think it\u2019s just a matter of a time when the pressure on the Dji Sam Soe should ease going forward. This is from a price point perspective.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","So, just to make sure that I understand that, you are saying some of the competitive pricing is scattered like within the country so that some markets probably in bigger cities have the higher price points but for the competitive brands but it's not everywhere?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think it is due to the size and the structure of the trade of the country, you don't have the price increases which will hit the retail and consumers in one given point in a time. You have this \u2013 you announced the prices, you introduced the prices to the trade and you might at have in a given point, in any given point a coexistence of the prices \u2013 two or three different price points per pack and\u2026","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Got you, okay.","Jacek Olczak","And as part of the rolling price increases, I mean, you rather work for the average price in the market at the retail level in order to upset the competitors. Now, I thing to add maybe that, you now, historically the Djarum brand and the GG brand, they were also trading or retailing below Dji Sam Soe, right.","So there is maybe some element of the price cut, but I believe it is more the element of the one price point of the 12 per pack \u2013 12,000 rupiah per pack, 1,000 per stick.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Well, and so in terms \u2013 I guess, it's almost two months now since they have announced those prices and to your point it may have flown through very widely. But have you seen any improvement in your trends on Dji Sam Soe into April so far?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we have been announcing the prices as well, so this is like sort of the moving curve situation, if you like. Right?","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Right. Okay.","Jacek Olczak","The market in a given one moment \u2013 in a given moment will cross the ones price point. We had a same situation with Dji Sam Soe when the Dji Sam Soe was crossing the 500 rupiah per stick. So it\u2019s not that we have not upselled with Dji Sam Soe that the brand was nicely growing.","We are the first ones to cross the round price point, at that time as I said, 500 rupiah per stick. I mean, we get there little bit of the share pressure and then we will recover. So I mean, let\u2019s see how this is going to play this time.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","And can you give any sense of what you expect for the second half, or any part of the rest of the year just in terms of what your share position might look like given that it is obviously it came down but it was also down versus 4Q. Do you expect it to stabilize or do you think it might get worse before it picks up again?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think that we should expect some less of the share pressure moderation or flattening of the share actually towards the second half, or in the second half of this year. Here Philip Morris in Indonesia had a little bit of pressure on the share if you look at the Q3, Q4 last year.","Okay. So we planned it grow at a much faster rate until about the mid of the last year than \u2013 okay, Dji Sam Soe again crossed this 12,000 price point, we started observing the pressure. I think we need to just let this period somehow lock.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Then in Japan you mentioned you have some programs in place, or starting, to become in place on Lark. Can you give a little color on what those are?","Jacek Olczak","I think we will have to stay a little bit of patient until everything is revealed in the market. So when we\u2019re talking about the future programs, I can't actually tell you much more in detail than what in the market that they announced. But obviously there is the things which drives, so the element which drives the market, i.e. innovation, modernization of the product perception, et cetera, I mean, it\u2019s something which is in the books.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, I know you mentioned the next-generation products. Is there any other details you can give us on those?","Jacek Olczak","Not at this stage. I think that the last week of June the Investors Day which we will have here for the investors community is the great opportunity for us to disclose more details, how and when and we\u2019re going to go into the first market. But we are very excited about it.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","All right. That sounds great. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett Nomura","Good morning, guys.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Owen Bennett Nomura","A couple of questions if I may. Firstly, I was just wondering if you could give some more details on what could be perceived as weaker pricing in EU. I mean, what is driving this? Is it the mix in Italy and is this likely to continue into the rest of the year?","Secondly, could you please give some more color on the business building initiatives in Brazil? And what these entail exactly and also how your share development is looking in Brazil? Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","Okay. I think the kind of pricing in Euro \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s actually Italy, right, because Italy is lacking some prices, as I have said this earlier.","Owen Bennett - Nomura","Yes.","Jacek Olczak","That Italy has this significantly inefficient tax system. I mean I was somehow compounded by the fact that it increased the VAT. They have not -- there was no offset on follow on rate. So that puts the pressure on the pricing in the region.","As I said, I mean, let's remain hopeful that the government sees what is the driver of the entire -- their revenue is also collection performance and how this going to be addressed. Meanwhile, we concentrated on holding a strong market share.","Our share essentially came flat. Marlboro came flat. This is despite the fact that we see some down trading between the medium and the low segment for this full euro price segment.","Chesterfield now is the significant player or key player actually in the full euro price segment, so I think we have some grip in the market. But that's essentially what is behind the pricing in euro, which I think I said that we have recently announced the price increase in Germany over \u20ac0.20 per pack, so I think this should also change the bigger picture going forward.","And when it comes to Brazil, I don't know if you asked the question, I think the market in Brazil for the quarter I remember was about 2.6% down, I think the market was about $17.3 billion. And our market share nicely grew to about 15.7% or I think improved by the 1.4 points -- it was 1.4 points for the quarter I think was our share.","Owen Bennett - Nomura","Okay. And just on the business building initiatives, I'm just wondering what that is exactly? Is that significant, or\u2026","Jacek Olczak","As we know we've very much strong focus at in the south of Brazil. And we had a plan of enlarging our presence there. And we are going from the south slowly to the north of Brazil. And this is also attracting volumes up. So step-by-step, I think we're making a very good progress in Brazil as we did however for the last couple of years.","Owen Bennett - Nomura","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Felberbaum of the Associated Press.","Michael Felberbaum - Associated Press","Hello, Jacek. I had a question on -- you had mentioned in the commentary for France, the growth of E-Vapor products and their impacts on combustible volumes. And I have wondered if you could provide any color on any overall trends you're seeing as far as the impact on volumes and the growth of E-Vapor products?","Jacek Olczak","Yes. I mean the color -- in terms of the color as always at the beginning of last year we observed 2013, we observed that sort of phenomena in Italy and not even a quarter later -- sorry four quarters later the product is actually, or the attractiveness of this product is fading out and there is no volume, no impact on the market.","Based on my knowledge of that category I don't see why France shouldn't play the same way. I mean we know what are the negatives, if you like, of e-cigarettes cigarettes in terms of a satisfaction, meeting the consumers' expectations, etcetera. So we now see this in France.","As I said, I saw that last year in Italy. I saw it sometime ago in Germany. I saw it sometime ago in Greece. I can start mentioning the market. And essentially the trend is very much being repeated across the country.","So it goes for the rapid sort of a growth. It's a lot of -- it confirms that there was an interest. And I think for a good reason the consumer is looking to this alternative, but the product as it is today in the market is not delivering on the consumer expectations.","Michael Felberbaum - Associated Press","Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","We've reached the allotted time for questions-and-answers.

You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.

Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer will join Andr\u00e9 for the question-and-answer period. Andr\u00e9?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. We anticipated that 2014 would be a particularly difficult and complex year for PMI and had in fact characterized it as an investment year.","We aimed to address specific challenges in key markets such as Italy, Japan and the Philippines, while also investing behind a number of strategic initiatives, including the pilot launches of iQOS, the roll-out of the Marlboro 2.0 Architecture and the optimization of our global manufacturing footprint. In addition, we faced an operating environment of continued macro-economic weakness and unprecedented currency headwinds.","Within this context, I am very pleased to announce that we delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014, achieving adjusted diluted EPS growth of 7.8%. This result exceeded the 6.5% to 7.5% guidance that we provided last November, due mainly to better than expected performances in the European Union and EEMA regions. In addition, we made very substantial progress in addressing our specific key market challenges and successfully executed on our strategic initiatives.","As anticipated, our fourth quarter results came in below our exceptionally strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition to this challenging comparison, the pattern of our expenses and the timing of key investments in 2014 were skewed towards the final quarter.","Our organic cigarette volume declined by 3.8% for the quarter, due to lower total cigarette industry volumes and inventory movements in the Asia and EEMA regions, partly offset by market share gains in the EU and EEMA regions. Excluding the adverse impact of inventory movements, volume for the quarter declined by approximately 2%.","Net revenues increased by 1.1%, excluding currency and acquisitions, with favorable pricing across all regions that more than offset unfavorable volume mix due principally to the Asia region.","Adjusted OCI declined by 10.6% on the same basis, due mainly to the aforementioned pattern of expenses and timing of investments. Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency of $1.31 decreased by 4.4%, compared to a 19.4% increase on the same basis in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Despite a historically high adverse currency headwind, we enter 2015 with strong business fundamentals and accordingly, remain optimistic regarding our business prospects going forward. Consequently, this year we are targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions of 4% to 6% for net revenues and 6% to 8% for adjusted OCI.","Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2015 at prevailing exchange rate is in a range of $4.27 to $4.37 versus $4.76 in 2014, and includes an unfavorable currency impact of approximately $1.15. This guidance represents a growth rate excluding currency, of approximately 8% to 10%, compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.02 in 2014.","As I will explain later, our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS and does not include any share repurchases.","The $1.15 of unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates, included in our 2015 guidance, is driven primarily by the Russian Ruble, the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Indonesian Rupiah.","These four currencies account for approximately 42%, 13%, 11% and 5%, respectively, or over 70% collectively, of the total unfavorable currency variance. We have currently hedged approximately 60% of our 2015 forecast sales to Japan, which at prevailing exchange rates translates to an effective rate of 110 Yen to the U.S. dollar.","Let me now discuss our progress in some of our regions and key markets, beginning with the marked improvement in the EU region. Total cigarette industry volume was down by 2.4% in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year decline to 3.1%.","This represents a significant moderation versus the 7.4% decline in 2013, which we attribute to the subdued performance of the e-vapor category, less out-switching to fine cut products, a reduction in illicit trade in several markets and lower than historical average pricing mainly in Italy. For 2015, we forecast a decline in industry -- in cigarette industry volume of approximately 4%.","Our 2014 market share performance in the EU region was impressive, with a gain of 1 percentage point to 39.9% in the fourth quarter and 1 point to 39.8% for the full year. This result reflects share growth in all six of the region\u2019s largest markets by cigarette industry volume, most notably in Italy and Poland.","In fact, our share gains in conjunction with the moderating industry volume decline resulted in essentially stable PMI cigarette volume in the EU region last year. This is a remarkable achievement and by far, the region\u2019s best cigarette volume performance since the spin. Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield were the primary drivers of our share performance in the EU region.","As of 2014, they represented the top three cigarette industry brands in the region by volume. For the year, Marlboro share grew by 0.3 points to 19.3%, L&M by 0.2 points to 7.1% and Chesterfield by 1.1 points to 5.5%. The performances of Marlboro in France and Spain, L&M in Germany, and Chesterfield in Italy and Poland were of particular note.","For 2015, we expect the EU region to return to low single-digit adjusted OCI growth, excluding currency and acquisitions. The excise tax environment remains rationale. Our leading brand portfolio positions us well for further share gains, driven by the continued rollout of the Marlboro 2.0 architecture. In addition, pricing is expected to be stronger than in 2014, in part due to recently increased cigarette prices in key markets such as Italy, Poland and Spain.","Let me briefly discuss the U.K. Government\u2019s recent announcement that it intends to proceed with the introduction of plain packaging. We believe this decision is ill-advised and is not based on scientific evidence. While we maintain an ongoing dialogue with regulators and hope that reason will ultimately prevail, we are prepared to pursue other alternatives, including litigation, to ensure the protection of our intellectual property.","Before closing on the EU Region, I would like to touch briefly on Italy, where the long-awaited tax reform was implemented last month. As shown on this slide, it includes a shift to a more specific structure and a higher minimum total tax, both important steps in the right direction. The reform also covered Reduced-Risk Products, with Marlboro HeatSticks now subject to a lower excise tax rate compared to cigarettes.","We enter the year with favorable share momentum, driven by the strong performance of Chesterfield, and in mid-January we increased our cigarette prices by \u20ac0.20 per pack across our portfolio.","I will now discuss selected markets from our Asia Region, beginning with Japan. Our strategy to stabilize market share last year was successful. Key drivers were the launch of our Be Marlboro marketing campaign, the introduction of Marlboro Clear Hybrid and the strengthening of the Lark brand family through morphing and new launches.","We plan to maintain our focus on these two key brands in 2005 [sic] [2015] through a robust innovation pipeline, as highlighted by the recent launch of Marlboro Fusion Blast, a menthol cigarette with two different capsules that provide novel taste sensations. And, of course, Japan was the first market to introduce iQOS, with its pilot launch in Nagoya last November. ","We plan to expand nationally in 2015. Industry volume in Japan declined by 3.4% in 2014, consistent with our projected 3% to 3.5% decline range. For 2015, we forecast that the decline will moderate to a range of 2.5% to 3%.","In Indonesia, industry volume was up by 1.9% in 2014 to 314 billion units. This growth was driven by a 7.5% increase in the machine-made kretek segment, which now accounts for approximately 74% of the total market, partially offset by a 13.1% decline in the hand-rolled kretek segment.","Our market share grew over the course of 2014 and reached 35.3% in the fourth quarter. This sequential improvement was driven by our strong performance in the machine-made kretek segment, due mainly to Dji Sam Soe Magnum and the successful launch of Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue in April of 2014.","We now hold approximately 30% share of this growing segment, led by our flagship brand Sampoerna A. There has been a significant moderation in the volume decline of our hand-rolled products, as competitive brands have followed Dji Sam Soe above the important 1,000 Rupiah per stick price point. As hand-rolled products face a significantly lower excise tax increase in 2015 than machine-made products, this bodes well for the segment, where we are the market leader. We forecast cigarette industry volume growth in 2015 of up to 2%, although the market will remain sensitive to fuel and commodity prices. ","While the Philippines continued to be a challenge and a drain on our 2014 income performance, we have recently witnessed significant positive price movements at the lower end of the market. After we raised the recommended stick price of Jackpot from 1.25 Pesos to 1.50 Pesos in October, our main competitor increased the recommended stick prices of its brands by 0.25 pesos in December and further increases have occurred since then.","This has reduced the stick price gap to Marlboro from 1.75 Pesos in January 2014 to between 1 Peso and 1.25 Pesos currently. We believe that the introduction of tax stamps will further improve the competitive environment in a market where cigarette consumption remained resilient last year at around 100 billion units. These developments augur well for profitability to improve over the mid-term and we remain bullish on the prospects for this market.","I will finish my discussion of the Asia Region with a brief update on Korea. The 120% increase in total tobacco excise taxes effective January 1st will be disruptive given its impact on the average retail selling price. To pass the tax on, we increased the retail price per pack for both Marlboro and Parliament by 1,800 Korean Won, or approximately 67% to 4,500 Korean Won.","For 2015, we forecast a decline in the underlying cigarette industry volume of approximately 20% to 25%. From an income perspective, however, the tax increase should not have a material impact on our business performance this year, due to a gain from inventories that we were able to build prior to the tax change.","Let me now turn to Russia, where we performed exceptionally well in 2014. Market share reached 27.1%, up by one full share point versus prior year. Our share growth was driven by the strong performance of above-premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and low-price Bond Street, which positions us well for further expansion in 2015.","Cigarette industry volume decreased by 9.2% in 2014, in line with our forecast of 9% to 10%. The decline was due primarily to significant excise tax-driven retail price increases, which averaged around 22% for PMI. These price increases helped us boost our unit margins and total profitability in the market, despite a 3.5% lower volume. For 2015, we forecast a decline in total cigarette industry volume of 8% to 10%, due to excise tax-driven price increases and a deteriorating macro-economic environment.","Moving on to our brand portfolio, Marlboro was a key driver of our continued global market share momentum in 2014, with growth of 0.3 points in both the EU and EEMA Regions. The brand\u2019s performance was particularly strong during the fourth quarter, with share growth in all four Regions, providing positive momentum heading into 2015.","Marlboro\u2019s share growth was driven by the successful initial rollout of architecture 2.0 in 26 markets, starting in the EU Region, and the expansion of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign to additional markets.","Beyond Marlboro, we are very pleased by the strong 2014 performances of our other key international brands, which demonstrate that our investments behind them are clearly paying off.","Of particular note was the continued robust growth of above-premium Parliament, with cigarette volume up by 5.6% versus 2013 and notable share gains in Russia and Turkey.","Chesterfield had an exceptional year, with cigarette volume growth of 22.6%. In addition to its success in the EU Region, which I covered earlier, the brand grew cigarette volume in all other regions.","L&M was also a success in 2014, with cigarette volume essentially stable or growing in three of our four regions and notable share gains in Germany, Russia and Ukraine. The unparalleled strength of our brand portfolio provides us with significant pricing power.","2014 was another robust year on this front, with a total pricing variance of $1.9 billion. This is in line with our historical annual average and was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada Region.","For 2015, we foresee our pricing variance remaining broadly in line with that of last year. Please note that, as of today, we have implemented or announced approximately 70% of the pricing that is included in 2015 EPS guidance.","We continue to focus vigorously on our cost base and in 2014, exceeded our gross productivity and cost savings target of $300 million, with significant savings related to specification rationalization and procurement.","In 2015, we anticipate that our productivity and cost savings program, combined with savings associated with the manufacturing footprint initiatives that we implemented in 2014, should result in a total company cost base increase, excluding RRPs and currency, of approximately 1%.","Turning now to our RRP portfolio, 2014 opened a groundbreaking new chapter in the history of our company with the commercialization of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan, and Milan, Italy. As a reminder, neither pilot launch is being made with any health claims. The marketing focus is on innovation and product benefits, such as no ash and less smell.","Although, it is still too early for a comprehensive quantitative assessment, I\u2019m very pleased to share with you that both adult smoker and trade response is very positive and that the performance of iQOS is in line with, or exceeds key indicators that we established. We should be in a better position to provide data around the middle of this year.","In Nagoya, total iQOS device sales are well ahead of projections and growing steadily every week. Sales of HeatSticks are also growing sequentially, but quite naturally do not yet reflect high rates of full conversion. However, as critical mass and product normalization build up over time, we would expect these rates to be in line with our 2013 whole offer test results.","Based on our latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 34% and adult smoker profiles are on target. Furthermore, the iQOS flagship store concept is a success. Our logistics chain is working well and product defect and return rates are much lower than we had anticipated.","In Milan, where the selling channel is limited by design to a subset of the tobacconist universe and consumer communication is severely restricted. iQOS device penetration has, as expected, lagged that of Nagoya. However, HeatSticks sales reflect a higher full conversion rate, consistent with the characteristics of the market.","Based on our latest estimates, iQOS awareness amongst adult smokers has reached approximately 16%. Other indicators are in line with Nagoya. In both markets, Marlboro HeatSticks are subject to a lower excise tax rate than cigarettes.","Given the positive initial performance of iQOS, we are confirming our plans to commence national expansion in Japan and Italy, as well as pilot or national launches in additional markets later this year. These launches will be supported by a new release of iQOS that incorporates feedback from the pilot market and features a variety of colors and textures to broaden the product\u2019s appeal amongst adult smokers.","Our 2015 guidance includes incremental spending versus 2014 for the deployment of iQOS, which is skewed towards the second half of the year. We continued to reward our shareholders generously in 2014, despite a significant currency headwind that adversely impacted our free cash flow by $1.6 billion.","Last September, our Board of Directors approved an increase of our dividend by a further 6.4% to $4 per share on an annualized basis. This represents an increase of approximately 117% since the spin-off in 2008 and equates to a dividend yield of 5% based on last Friday\u2019s closing share price.","In 2014, we paid $6 billion in total dividends to our shareholders and spent a further $3.8 billion to repurchase 45.2 million shares. We are currently operating in a debt level corridor that is close to the maximum that would still allow us to maintain our single-A credit rating.","We remain committed to returning around 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders, and are taking appropriate measures to further reduce our working capital and keep capital expenditures flat despite the expansion of RRP.","At prevailing exchange rates, the adverse currency impact on our 2015 net earnings would be approximately $1.7 billion, which consequently will impact free cash flow. Furthermore, the currency environment remains extremely volatile. In this context, we are focused on managing our cash flow prudently and maintaining financial flexibility for business development opportunities.","Consequently, we do not currently envisage any share repurchases in 2015 and this is reflected in our guidance. However, we will revisit the potential for such purchases as the year unfolds, depending on the currency environment.","In conclusion, we enter 2015 with confidence in our business outlook. We delivered a solid currency-neutral performance in 2014, with adjusted diluted EPS growth above our guidance and successfully executed on a number of our key strategic initiatives that will generate attractive returns in the years to come. We also made substantial progress in addressing market specific challenges.","Our business is supported by strong fundamentals and positive momentum. Our leading brand portfolio is driving continued robust pricing and market share gains, while our vigorous focus on our cost base, notably through the optimization of our manufacturing footprint is enhancing operational efficiency.","These strong fundamentals are enhanced by our investment behind reduced-risk product. We are excited by the prospects for iQOS and are pleased by its performance thus far.","For 2015, we are targeting currency-neutral annual growth, excluding acquisitions of 4% to 6% for net revenues and 6% to 8% for adjusted OCI.","We are further targeting growth in adjusted diluted EPS of 8% to 10%, excluding currency. These targets are a clear reflection of the strong confidence that we have in both our business and the outlook for the year, particularly given our incremental spending behind the deployment of iQOS.","Thank you. Jacek and I will now be very happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good afternoon.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Thanks. Just two questions. One, I wanted to ask a bit more about Japan to better understand the inventory reduction there. Is that a function of how retailers are temporarily managing levels across manufacturers? And consequently, is that a timing issue that could reverse next year, or was that just the lag result of some of the share losses you\u2019ve seen in over 2013 and earlier this year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. To put this inventory movements in context, we should all remind -- remember that we had to close better than to resume during last year. And this is an $80 billion plus cigarette factory and consequently, we had to prepare for the closure and also move production to a number of other factories. We had to build in a particular case of Japan, some safety stocks but not only in the case of Japan during the year. And some of these inventories had to carry through the year end and will come back in 2015.","For the particular case of Japan, however, the objective for the year was to adjust inventory hurdles to both the market decline in 2014 and anticipate it for 2015 and in addition to that to our lower market share. Okay. And the vast majority, clearly of these adjustments as we right sized will not come back. And as I said, because of maintaining some safety during the year, we had to do this adjustment in the last quarter. So that\u2019s basically the whole story.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. If we are trying to put that in context, I think your many investors will look at the flat adjusted operating profit performance this year. And the expected acceleration back to 6 to 8 next year and view that as a fairly high hurdle. If we are trying to look at the some of the moving pieces that will shift from year-to-year, those inventory reductions in Japan over the course of the year that you sort of purposely of course corrected on, how much of a drag was that on this year\u2019s full year adjusted -- total company adjusted operating profit?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I think the inventories in the last quarter, I can\u2019t quantify exactly, I appreciate, but probably 1 point.","Jacek Olczak","Above the 1 point in our growth rate throughout the year. 1 point.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","On adjusted basis, what was our volume development in the fourth quarter, I mean, we read it, Andr\u00e9 read it in the remarks. So, yes, there was a drag clearly coming from this rescheduling of a supply chain and the subsequent inventory.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. That\u2019s helpful.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","The key positives for the year, clearly is the improvement in the Philippines. I think that was big, I think issue we had in 2014. We -- I think we stabilized in any case the share at Japan that was even bigger, better than the inventories.","I think the business in Europe is doing fine. So I think we fix the issues we had announced we need to fix in 2014. And we\u2019ve just behind that. I think we can look with optimism into 2015 and that clearly explains the swing we have in terms of OCI growth.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Thanks Andr\u00e9. And just Jacek, perhaps with respect to the dividend, I know this is a hypothetical question and you may just prefer not to address it. But the payout ratio is obviously extremely high right now, are there any guidelines you can provide on how you or the board would react if currency headwinds pushed the payout ratio even higher on a reported basis? Would the goal under those circumstances be to sustain some level of ongoing dividend growth even if that was only modest if you had, let\u2019s say, 100% payout ratio?","Jacek Olczak","I can answer that question but I think Andr\u00e9 would be even more enthusiastic about answering this question.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Look we all understand there is huge currency volatility in 2015 and we have to be bit cautious. And clearly, dividend is more prerogative as you know very well. But I understand where your question points to or points at and I see a no scenario under which we will reduce the dividend in 2015, okay, even if we have to temporarily stay at a very high payout ratio.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Okay. Thank you both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Bushnell of Exane.","James Bushnell","Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up a little bit on the last point, so you mentioned that the stock production in Japan took points of OCI growth in Q4. I\u2019m thinking about Asia because that\u2019s clearly where you have the most weakness in the quarter. I wondered if you could give us a feeling of the moving parts there? So was Australia the biggest drag on your profits? And I know there are some other things at the Philippines and you had some investments. So I just wonder if you\u2019d help us think through what the big drags are there and then that would help in terms of modeling going forward? Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, I think you mentioned them. Clearly, Australia was a big drag compared to 2013. And we had Japan overall as we said at the beginning of the year because we expect a lot of share at the time of the inventory adjustment, clearly, Japan would be another drag. Now, we\u2019ve stabilized our share and quarter-to-quarter daily, Japan, on an underlying business basis is rather stable but where to make the timing of this inventory in Japan as I explained previously because we had to maintain certain safety stocks until the whole situation of Bergen op Zoom closure is resolved.","So I would say its Australia and clearly, partially the Philippines. Don\u2019t forget that in the Philippines, we increased prices ahead of main competitor there plus during the year we had to absorb partially excise tax. Now the good news about the Philippines is that we had the price movement at the bottom of the market. Prices per stick now of virtually any brand that comes are 2 or above, our price gaps are reducing.","So the Philippines definitely are now going to be of any negativity and if any, they will turn positive this year and I think that\u2019s an excellent develop, but we have to watch the situation that really carefully. But so far so good, I mean, I feel much better now, as I say, six months ago and three months ago, I can tell you.","James Bushnell","Okay. Thank you. And I wonder if you could comment also on the how you see the outlook in Australia this year, please?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","It is early day, first of all, in Australia, the market decline is 10.6%, but if we correct for inventory movements 2013 to \u201914, the underlying is roughly [4.6 points over there] [ph]. And as we know, this is entirely driven by the excise driven price increase that are pretty substantial in Australia.","I think we know about the issues in Australia is the growth of the low price that the deep discount segment and some competitive activities. So we said that we have to put in place a strategy to extend the growth and I think our pricing strategy that is currently in pace is bring results.","We see a slight deceleration of the deep discount segment, part of this is -- technical part of this is real. But I would not say, yes, that we can declare that the deep discount segment has stabilized. But sequentially looks like it doesn\u2019t grow any more at the pace it used to be.","We also see some positive price movement at the bottom end of the market. That\u2019s good news. Business will be confirmed, because if there is price movement, it\u2019s good, but we have to see how much of that is discounted back, if that sticks, this is also a positive development.","Overall, I -- our estimate is that it\u2019s unlikely that Australia will contribute positively to our OCI growth this year, but definitely we don\u2019t anticipate this to be the kind of marginal drag that we had in 2014, okay. So it\u2019s early days. We will see how the next three, four months unfold. I don\u2019t know if I answered your question.","James Bushnell","Okay. No. It does. That was great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Yeah. Hi, Andr\u00e9 and Jacek.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi.","Jacek Olczak","Hi.","Judy Hong","So, maybe, first on FX, I guess, just maybe given the really the heightened level of FX volatility, can you talk about if there any plans to perhaps better align your revenue and cost structure in some of your key markets like Russia, Japan, and even your exposure to Swiss franc?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I think we look at our cost structures constantly and we are focused on improving productivity and efficiency. And I think that indication we gave that total cost excluding RRPs are going to grow by normal than 1%. It\u2019s a clear sign that we are very focused on these items.","Now every market is particular and Jacek will elaborate a bit more on this. But as a matter of principle, in many markets we have costs that are in local currency, but we also have costs that are in euros or in dollars, like tobacco, leaf and certain materials. And clearly rebalancing that cost structure is a bit more difficult. But today, I would say that in the vast majority of the market, even in Russia we are not dollarized in terms of the cost basis we have and agreements we have with the parties other than the materials I explained. So we see a reduction in the cost base as well as currencies devalued.","Jacek Olczak","You are absolutely, right. Judy, one thing which maybe will help looking at the same $0.80 EPS, negative variance is the currency net in '14, the transaction impact, negative transaction impact is just in a range of 10% of this total amount. So most of the impact which we are incurring is coming from translations. And to Andr\u00e9\u2019s point, if I take the largest individual market on net profitability per market we take Indonesia, Russia and we have a local cost, this in a range of 65% to 75% in total cost. So this is COGS in all discretionary marketing overhead etcetera spend.","So we have obviously there quite a significant portion of the natural hedges for the cost structures already building, but as I said earlier, the impact on us is mainly coming from a translation.","Judy Hong","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just maybe looking at Russia and the industry volume was down 9.2% in 2014. Your volume actually did a lot better down 3.5%. I think you are commenting on 2015, industry being down in that 8% to 10% range. So my first question related to that is your confidence in keeping your volume decline much more modest versus the industry and obviously that implies continued market share in that market?","And then secondly given that the tax increases in 2015 in Russia is more modest. Do you think that 8% to 10% volume decline is more representative just the macro pressures that you are experiencing in that market? And related to that just comment on how you are seeing sort of the pricing in that market and the consumer\u2019s ability to absorb cigarette price increases in a pretty inflationary market?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. We had very, very good year in Russia in 2014 and I believe the portfolio fundamentals were plus the initiative should maintain a share growth momentum. Now whether this can fully compensate volume or not, this has to be seen, okay. The second important thing in Russia is a question of pricing. We had about 22% pricing in 2014 and November and December prices were up roughly 13% if move way above average on our portfolio which of course will carry forward almost entirely in 2016. You appreciate, I cannot comment about further price increases for the year.","But the situation in Russia we all watch it very closely, clearly a combination of the sanctions in the oil price have an impact on the economy. We start seeing inflation and quite the unknown is for the year and this is not only particular to Philip Morris is what will happen with real incomes and salary, okay.","So as you know we take pricing decision trying to balance our ways, consumer affordability, price gaps, illicit trade and clearly margin improvement and we will always pursue the opportunity within that equation. This is -- Russia is because of the microeconomic environment we have to assume that we will have a similar decline in 2015 that we had in 2014 despite as we rightly pointed out a lower excise tax, okay. So how this will unfold, I don\u2019t know. I will be happiest man on earth if the decline is lower than what we perceived.","Judy Hong","Got it. Okay. Thank you, both.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi, Andr\u00e9.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","I was hoping you could drill down a little further on the consumer behavior surrounding iQOS in your two test markets. For instance, could you give us a better sense of dual usage, repeat purchase for example, and then cannibalization rates maybe on Marlboro combustible or possibly any of your other brands? And then I would also like to hear from you what was the biggest positive surprise and the biggest negative surprise from your two tests.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. A lot of questions, Bonnie. First of all, I think overall we are obviously positively surprise by their performance we had. You appreciate, I cannot disclose precise numbers for competitive reasons, but clearly our device -- our iQOS device sales were well ahead of what we had initially projected and we are talking to thousands of units okay and we are not talking small quantities. And they continue every week at a pace of 3% to 4%, so this is not bad at all.","Regarding conversion rates, it is a bit premature to measure this because as we are building a consumer base, it takes time to make the assessment and takes time for people to fully convert. The numbers we see in terms clearly of offtake or repeat purchase and mind you some of the consumers bought cartons at the beginning, so it\u2019s difficult to judge daily purchases of product. We see that the rate of full conversion is clearly lagging behind the amount of units we sold. But that\u2019s natural and we expect it, okay. We also need to understand the situation in Japan that people still have the ability to smoke combustible products in very many venues. So that\u2019s natural that initially they use iQOS in situations like in warehouses or in office where they can\u2019t use combustible products and mostly and slowly they will eventually convert more and more.","So I don\u2019t have yet a sufficient database to know exactly what the conversion fully conversion versus occasional are. We will have a better reading a couple of months, but all I am saying is that the progress is pretty good and steady okay. And we should not be totally impatient and think that everybody will convert in day one. Even with the people I go around, they took some time to convert.","And the awareness of the product is right. I think the consumer profile is a target. And as I said also in my remarks, we are testing our supply chain, returns rates are much lower than we thought, although people have the option to return the products if they are not happy. And we are learning also a lot in terms of marketing so that we can adjust our programs when we go national, but overall it\u2019s pretty good experience.","As expected, and I said in my remarks in Milano because of less marketing freedoms and more difficult and it\u2019s higher difficult to create awareness, we are a bit behind Nagoya in terms of absolute amount of iQOS unit sold still in thousand, but we have an apparently higher full conversion rate also because there are much more restrictions in Italy. One particularity of Italy is that there is an initial, I would say reluctance for people who have tried electronic cigarettes to try iQOS because they had a bad experience with electronic cigarettes, but the ones who finally try and buy, they are more committed because they see the difference. But this is more qualitative and anecdotal at this stage than quantitative. So again, good progress. We decided to go national and in few months, we will have something that is really quantifiable and of course we will communicate this to you.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then I just have a question or I guess probably a two-part question on your margins. First, your margins in the fourth quarter deteriorated quite a bit, so could you drill down on the key drivers for this? And then in terms of '15, you mentioned your cost ex-RRP will increase 1%. So just trying to understand what you\u2019re hoping to achieve or accomplish with these higher costs and investments? Clearly you are making strategic investments in your business. So how should we think about this in terms of the potential for accelerated growth in the future?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. I am referring to you the 1% refers to the entire base, okay. We should not forget that we have the benefit also this year of the manufacturing footprint improvement of last year, okay. We also benefit with for moderating leaf prices that will continue into the future and growth price also that has been a big cost item in 2012 and '13 are also kind of stabilizing as we had good crops.","So from a manufacturing perspective, clearly we are on the low end of the cost. So that for the business, we pursue also efficiency improvement programs, but we never stop the investments that will grow the business further.","And for this year clearly, we have some exciting programs on all the brands. We continue with the deployment of 2.0 Marlboro. We started with red. We continue with Marlboro Gold and the other variance of the brands, so that continues investment.","And we also essentially revamped and created new marketing campaigns for all the other key brands in the portfolio that we are also deploying and investing besides them. But as I said in my remarks, clearly, that pays dividends. So be reassured that we don\u2019t stop investing behind the growth of the business and I think, the market share performance has demonstrated that were the right thing to do.","For the rest, as we said in -- and I said in previous intervention, our long-term objective is to always contain cost between 1% to 3% ex-RRPs. And depending on leaf prices, I think we can even at least, for the next two years remain at the lower end of this range. So I think we are pretty happier about that.","And just to clarify on also RRPs, there is incremental investment this year compared to last year\u2019s incremental investment and the variance is slightly above the range we had last year or the north we had last year. So it\u2019s about 1 EPS point just the increment, okay.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. All right. Thank you. That was helpful. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good afternoon.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Good afternoon.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just had two questions for you if I could please. The first one, I\u2019m just curious by Andr\u00e9 your view on, I mean, you talked about 2014 definite macro-economic effect on the business. It would seem like that environment generally still in place in \u201915? I guess, related that, I\u2019m just curious, if you could give a general outlook for volume? And also just curious you\u2019re seeing any mix degradation across the business, any trade down broadly that is rather than market by market, is that having an effect on the business in \u201915?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. It\u2019s difficult, obviously, to appreciate to predict total industry volume this year. I would see and I will explain some of the caveat in the 2% to 3% range, okay. This is what I mentioned previously that mid-term, I think, would return to 1% to 2%. First of all, we have all this currency situation that it\u2019s very difficult to predict what precise effect is going to have on the economies around the planet.","Second thing, clearly, we had to revise our estimate for the Russian market given the particular situation there. We thought that 2015 would be the range 4% to 6% roughly. Now we think that it will be at 8% to 10%, of course, that\u2019s an assumption. And the positive, however, can come from the Philippines, because when I say 2% to 3% that assumes that no cigarettes return to the legal market in the Philippine.","Now, hopefully, given the development in the Philippines, we\u2019ll see some more volume coming back to the legal market and that can change clearly the overall equation. So we may end up in the middle of that range I gave, but that\u2019s the best I can do at this stage.","Chris Growe","Okay. That\u2019s fair enough.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. Now, the overall economic outlook, we all know the fundamentals, okay. Oil prices will be lower, so that\u2019s helps economy and consumer spending. But in some places we\u2019re going to see inflation following devaluation. Not in many, because as we all know, its only one currency appreciating and all the others depreciating and remaining in relative parity to each other, so they -- when they trade with each other, we don\u2019t have imported inflation. So Russia is the one that comes to mind first as we discuss previously.","Overall, I don\u2019t see an acceleration, I think, overall of down trading at all on a global basis. I think we said, we stay on the same trends as we were in 2014, although slightly better, okay.","We know the specifics of Australia. We discussed it and so on. Obviously, there is a bit of geographic mix. But if we look at total market declines in 2014, there is no substantial difference between OECD and non-OCED especially, thanks to the recovery of the European Union. I mean, OECD decline roughly three point something percent and non-OECD 2.5% in 2015. So, I would say overall nothing worrisome at this stage.","Chris Growe","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. If I could just ask one question, just for me to understand, just some perspective on the lack of share repurchase obviously, supporting the dividends and that\u2019s very important to you. I want to understand like throughout 2015, would you add this sort of this -- sort of at the margin you\u2019re close to a debt level that would push your rating down?","Is there any consideration where you would allow for the debt rating to go down? I\u2019m just thinking about acquisitions for example. So maybe not so much for share repurchase but from an acquisition standpoint, would you or the Board consider the debt rating -- and violating the debt rating if you will?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","We always said and I maintain this. We will not lose our rating for share repurchase purposes. Now, if we have a strategic reason, that is a strategic acquisition or something then of course that can be considered. Okay. Absent that, we will do everything we can to maintain our A rating. Okay. And I think we have to be prudent on how we manage the situation given the currency volatility we are in.","Having said that, I want to stress that we are committed to share repurchases. We\u2019ll see how the situation unfolds. And as soon as we can resume them, we will. We\u2019ll not change our approach to that. It is just a temporary situation that calls for caution given what happened with the currency. Okay.","Chris Growe","Sure. Well, that\u2019s good perspective. Thank you for your time.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery","Good afternoon. So just -- I guess two things that we\u2019ve touched on already. If it came down to it and you had to decide between the dividend and the debt rating, how do those fall relative to each other in terms of priority?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","I think I tried to clarify this. First of all, it\u2019s rather a speculative situation and I said that I don\u2019t see scenarios under which we will reduce our dividends, unless we have third World War.","Michael Lavery","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. So the dividend would come before -- if you had to choose between the two, the debt rating might suffer before the dividend certainly. That\u2019s fair.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah. But if you do the mathematics, that\u2019s a consequential effect. So, yeah. ","Michael Lavery","Okay, Andr\u00e9. Thank you. And then just looking at the EU, your guidance for the operating income growth there, does that include the savings from the Netherlands\u2019 plant and how much -- can you quantify how much that is?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Well, that\u2019s all baked. Yes, it includes obviously the savings from the footprint optimization and that\u2019s included in the overall guidance and in the cost indications I gave.","Michael Lavery","So, how much does that add from just the plant closure?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","A variety of reasons, I cannot disclose that number. I\u2019m sorry.","Michael Lavery","Okay. No problem. And then just looking at Indonesia, certainly, the inflation from the fuel subsidy cuts late in the quarter had an impact on the category volumes there. But with oil prices pulling back, that\u2019s reversed now. Can you give any sense of what -- even though it\u2019s early in this year, have you seen the improvement in January or what does it look like so far as start to the year?","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","It\u2019s very early to judge the effect. But that you said is correct. I mean, the subsidies were removed but oil prices are a bit low. We didn\u2019t say anything in the market generally that shows any change in the dynamic in this direction but it is only one month. Okay.","Michael Lavery","So there is no other improvement yet but it\u2019s just too early to really see.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yeah. We didn\u2019t see any effect in January. That\u2019s all I can tell you.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Vivien Azer of Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer","Hi. Good afternoon. In terms of your outlook for pricing for 2015 please, with it being broadly in line with historical levels, can you talk a little bit about the compensation of that pricing contribution because historically, it\u2019s been fairly well balanced over year across your geographies but clearly in 2014 it was decidedly weighted towards EEMA and Latin America? Thank you.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Yes. In 2015, it is very balanced.","Vivien Azer","Okay. And then the second \u2026.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","So it is actual that\u2019s why we project and now we know the specificities of 2014, we had Italy that skewed clearly the European Union. And we also had the Philippines absorption that skewed Asia and these are the two fundamentals. Okay, now.","Vivien Azer","Thank you. That\u2019s very clear. As a follow-up on the EPS growth outlook of 8% to 10% on -- impressive that you guys are maintaining that absent at the buyback, but as I think about the contribution then from not operating items of 200 basis point, clearly you get the residual benefit of $3.8 billion of share repurchases that you did this year but can you comment Jacek at all about your outlook either for tax or for interest expense?","Jacek Olczak","On the tax, we should stay broadly in that effective tax rate, which we had in 2014. So it looking 29, slightly below 29%. And on the interest expenses, you remember I hope that quite the portion of our debt portfolio you seen euros. And so obviously, it\u2019s put a bit of the lower pressure or reduces the pressure coming from the interest to serve our bond portfolio. So there is some benefit on us coming due to the overall lower interest rate, lower interest rate environment and also for the composition of our debt portfolio due to the significant portion of the euro debt.","Vivien Azer","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Hi, Erik.","Erik Bloomquist","Hi. Good afternoon. Hello. One of the markets that we haven\u2019t really talked about today was Turkey and there we\u2019ve seen a volume is improved a bit. So I was wondering if you can comment on the outlook for the Turkish market, is the down trading finished or does it look like it\u2019s stable and does that then suggest that there is an opportunity for perhaps some profit growth and -- with the volume base remaining stable or have there been some regulatory moves there that suggest we may have another difficult year following a decent year in Turkey? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Well, volumes in Turkey are stable. Illicit trade is stable. Okay. Increased a little bit, which outlines that the underlying volume is even better. I don\u2019t see any change at this stage. I mean excise taxes are in. There was moderate increase in the specific and of the minimum tax.","So from a total market perspective, I don\u2019t see any particular change in the trend. Now regarding the dynamics, clearly, there has been some down trading but shares have to -- seem to have stabilized now. And we did very well in the premium segment, particularly with parliament this type all the down trading. So I think we are there for a decent year in Turkey going forward.","Erik Bloomquist","Thank you.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.","Owen Bennett","Good afternoon, guys. And just a couple of questions. Firstly, I was just hoping you could give an update on the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 in terms of how is it performing with regards to retaining current Marlboro smokers and also I guess crucially is attracting competitive smokers. And also how many more markets are expected in 2015?","And secondly, just coming back to Russia pricing, and we understand that you may have gotten a pricing benefit in 2014 from your stake in Megapolis? And could you confirm whether this is correct, and if so, is there likely to be some giveback from this benefit in 2015? Thanks very much.","Jacek Olczak","The rollout of Marlboro.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Okay. On Marlboro, I think we are very pleased with our rollout. We have 100% retention of existing smokers, which is I think remarkable. And we do see change both in profiles and other all attraction from competitive smokers and the share performance of the brand in the markets where we have rolled out is a clear testimony to the success of 2.0.","And we will continue rolling it out. The plan is to be fully down with all the rollouts by early 2016, okay. We are ready in 26 markets and growing by the day. So which is through the planning and we are very happy with it. Now Megapolis is not in the pricing but an item that is below the OCI line, okay. I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m asking the people that are more.","Owen Bennett","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Its income unconsolidated that\u2019s where it is, okay.","Owen Bennett","Okay.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","We have received clearly a dividend, so yes it will be somehow affected by the ruble, et cetera temporarily, but that\u2019s currency clearly.","Owen Bennett","Okay. Thanks.","Andr\u00e9 Calantzopoulos","Thanks Owen.","Operator","And that was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing or additional remarks.","Nick Rolli","That concludes our call for today. Thank you all for joining us.

And welcome to the Philip Morris International Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions].","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome, and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2019 second quarter results. You may access the release on www.pmi.com or the PMI Investor Relations app. A glossary of terms, including the definition for reduced risk products, or RRPs, as well as adjustments, other calculations and reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website. Unless otherwise stated, all references to IQOS are to our IQOS heat-not-burn products.","Comparisons presented on a like-for-like basis reflected pro forma 2018 results which have been adjusted for the deconsolidation of our Canadian subsidiary, Rothmans, Benson & Hedges, Inc. effective March 22, 2019.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Martin King, our Chief Financial Officer. Martin?","Martin King","Thank you, Nick. And welcome ladies and gentlemen. Building on our encouraging start to the year, we delivered very solid performance in the second quarter, notably reflecting positive momentum for both our combustible tobacco and smoke free product portfolios and strong currency neutral adjusted financial results.","Key among our strength in the second quarter was our volume performance. On a like-for-like basis, total shipment volume declined by 0.7% in the quarter and increased by 0.1% June year-to-date. This performance was better than we had anticipated notably driven by the EU region.","Heated tobacco unit shipment volume increased by 37% to 15.1 billion units in the quarter driven by the EU region, Eastern Europe region and Japan. Second quarter net revenues increased by 9% excluding currency on a like-for-like basis driven by higher HTU shipment volume and favorable pricing for our combustible tobacco portfolio. Our performance was flattered by the timing of pricing in certain markets compared to the prior year, which contributed an estimated two percentage points to net revenue growth.","RRP net revenues reached nearly $1.5 billion in the quarter or nearly 20% of PMI\u2019s total net revenues. IQOS devices accounted for approximately 14% of RRP net revenues compared to approximately 19% in the second quarter of 2018.","We recorded a strong like-for-like combustible pricing variance of over 6% in the quarter, driven notably by Germany, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Russia, and Turkey. We have recently increased our cigarette prices in markets such as Mexico and Ukraine, which should further contribute to a positive pricing variance over the balance of 2019.","On a currency-neutral like-for-like basis, adjusted operating income increased by 15.7% in the second quarter, while adjusted operating income margin increased by 240 basis points. The strong margin expansion was driven primarily by favorable geographic volume from high cost geographies with relatively high unit margins, notably markets in the EU region.","Like-for-like adjusted diluted EPS increased by 15% excluding currency, driven by our strong business performance. Our total international market share, excluding China and the U.S. increased by 0.1 percentage point to reach 28.3% in the second quarter. This growth was driven by heated tobacco units, which increased by 0.5 points to reach 2.1% reflecting broad based share gains across the EU region and in Japan and Russia.","In the markets where I QOS has been commercialized, our HTU brands recorded a total combined share of nearly 5% in the quarter, despite not yet being fully distributed in many of them.","Our share performance for cigarettes in the quarter reflected continued adult smoker out switching to IQOS as well as an estimated adverse impact of a proxy point two points related to Turkey, due to the timing of price increases vis-\u00e0-vis the competition. We expect our share performance in Turkey to improve over the balance of the year.","Turning now to RRPs. We surpassed 11 million IQOS users as of quarter end. Approximately 70% of the total or some 8 million IQOS users have stopped smoking and switched to IQOS with the balance in various stages of conversion.","In the EU region, HEETS continued its sequential quarterly share growth increasing by 0.3 percentage points to reach 2.4%. This growth reflects success across a broad range of markets with varying regulatory frameworks and adult smoker preferences. We have achieved significant progress with IQOS across the region over the past year as evidenced by the HEETS market shares shown on this slide.","This includes strong growth in some of our larger markets such as Italy, Poland and Germany as well as even faster growth in other markets, such as the Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania and the Slovak Republic.","HEETS continued its strong performance in Russia in the quarter, with sequential in market sales growth of over 23% and national share of 29%. As a reminder, our first quarter HEET share was flattered by the impact on the total market of seasonally lower cigarette industry volume.","In market sales volume progression therefore remains a more realistic indicator of the brand's trajectory. For reference, we estimate a first quarter adjusted share of 2.3% implying sequential share growth of point six points in the second quarter. We continued our geographic expansion during the quarter, and are now commercializing IQOS in cities representing an estimated 40% of the market by total industry volume, compared to approximate 32% at the end of the first quarter.","In Japan, our total share for HeatSticks and HEET increased by 1.1 points versus the second quarter of 2018 to reach 16.6% further demonstrating that the initiatives we introduced during the second half of last year are paying off and driving a step up in our share performance.","After adjusting for the impact of estimated trade inventory movements, which benefited our first quarter share this year, our share was stable on a sequential basis. We continue to anticipate greater competitive activity in the category as the year progresses. While this may increase competitive churn among adult consumers over the short term as they try new products, we ultimately view this as a positive development for the category overall and for IQOS in particular.","As I will cover later in my remarks, we're investing behind further enhancements to the IQOS 3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand's leadership position. Importantly, share for both the heated tobacco category and our heated tobacco brands continued to grow sequentially in the quarter, based on the latest consumer off-take share data.","In Korea, the heated tobacco category continues to be highly competitive particularly in the area of non-menthol flavors and related new taste dimensions. Share for HEET declined by 0.7 points and was stable on a sequential basis at 7.3%. This performance was flattered by the impact of inventory movements as seen from the adjusted market share progression. We attribute the current share dynamics mainly to competitive churn as new devices and consumables from the competition have entered the market and experienced initial trial.","We plan to broaden our portfolio of HEET to better address the unique taste preferences of adult tobacco consumers in Korea and have related launches scheduled for the second half of 2019.","In addition, like Japan, Korea will be an initial focused geography for the upgraded IQOS3 device. It is important to remember that aside from Japan and Korea, our focus for IQOS across most launch markets remains targeted to key cities. These city level shares compare very favorably to the corresponding national shares and provide an encouraging indicator of the greater opportunity that can come with broader focus and support in IQOS markets.","Before closing on IQOS, I would also like to reiterate our excitement over the prospects for IQOS in the U.S. As a reminder, on April 30th, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration confirmed that the marketing of IQOS is appropriate for the protection of public health and authorized it for sale in the U.S. We are excited to bring IQOS to the U.S. market to an exclusive license with Altria Group, Inc. whose subsidiary Philip Morris USA has the market expertise and infrastructure to ensure a successful launch, beginning with the initial lead market of Atlanta Georgia.","Turning to our full year outlook, we are raising our 2019 reported diluted EPS guidance at prevailing exchange rates to be at least $4.94. The $0.07 increase compared to our prior guidance on May 1st of at least $4.87 was be driven by stronger business performance primarily reflecting better shipment volume and a tax benefit of $0.04 related to a reduction in estimated U.S. federal income tax on dividend repatriation for the year 2015 to 2018, partly offset by asset impairment and exit costs of approximately $0.02 per share related to a plant closure in Colombia as part of our global manufacturing infrastructure optimization.","Our guidance continues to include an unfavorable currency impact at prevailing exchange rates of approximately $0.14 per share with just $0.01 in the second half of the year. Items outlined on this slide, our forecast represents a projected currency neutral like-for-like increase of at least 9% versus our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $4.84 in 2018.","Our increased guidance now assumes a total shipment volume decline of approximately 1% on a like-for-like basis versus a decline of 1.5% to 2% assumed previously. We continue to anticipate full year HTU shipment volume broadly in line with our in market sales volume with any net inventory movements in individual markets essentially offsetting on an aggregate basis.","For the industry, we now estimate a total volume decline in 2019 of approximately 2.5% excluding China and the U.S. which is at the low end of the previously communicated decline range of 2.5% to 3%.","Our increased guidance further assumes like-for-like net revenue growth excluding currency of at least 6% compared to the assumption of at least 5% in our prior guidance. We also now expect IQOS device net revenues to account for less than 20% of our total RRP net revenues in 2019. The change from the previously communicated range of 20% to 25% primarily reflects the favorable geographic mix impact related to HTU shipment volume that I noted earlier.","We continue to anticipate a full year like-for-like combustible pricing variance above 5% supported by our June year-to-date variance of 5.2%. This positive top line momentum provides us the opportunity to further increase or advance investment behind IQOS in order to accelerate product and commercial development, expand distribution in both existing and new geographies during the second half of 2019, further enhance the IQOS3 device in 2019 to reinforce the brand, and strengthen our category leadership as competition intensifies.","Consequently, we now anticipate net incremental investments behind RRPs this year of approximately $400 million compared to our previously disclosed estimate of approximately $300 million. With the majority of the 100 million step up in investment expected to occur in the third quarter. We believe this increased investment will reinforce the positive momentum behind IQOS heading into 2020.","Despite the increased investment, we are maintaining our assumption of currency-neutral adjusted operating income margin expansion of at least 100 basis points on a like-for-like basis. While we don't give quarterly guidance, I believe it is appropriate to provide some additional visibility on the third quarter in which we expect currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS to be essentially flat compared to our pro forma adjusted diluted EPS of $1.35.","This estimate assumes a like-for-like currency neutral net revenue growth rate in the quarter slightly below our full year assumption. As I noted earlier compared to last year, our second quarter net revenue growth benefited from the timing of price increases in certain markets and some of this benefit will be offset in the third quarter.","We also face a challenging combustible pricing comparison versus the third quarter of 2018, our strongest quarter for pricing last year. Coupled with our top line assumption, our third quarter EPS estimate also reflects higher expected costs on a like-for-like basis. This is primarily due to our net incremental investments behind RRPs with about half of the full year total of approximately $400 million expected to come in the quarter.","Turning to cash flow. We continue to anticipate full year operating cash flow of approximately $95 billion subject to year-end working capital requirements as well as capital expenditures of approximately $1.1 billion. In conclusion, we're building upon our promising start to the year and delivering a very solid performance in the second quarter.","The fundamental supporting our strong combustible tobacco portfolio are intact. The favorable momentum for IQOS continues across geographies, further supporting our confidence in our HTU shipment volume targets of 90 units to 100 billion units by 2021.","Finally, on a currency-neutral like-for-like basis, we have increased our full year 2019 growth assumption for net revenues to at least 6%, and our anticipated full year 2019 growth rate for adjusted diluted EPS to at least 9% further demonstrating our overall confidence in PMI short and long term growth prospects.","Thank you. I'm now happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now conduct the question-and-answer portion of the conference [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Adam Spielman of Citi.","Adam Spielman","Hello, thank you very much. I guess, I have two questions. Clearly, you've guided both to better volumes for the markets and more -- on a bigger improvement for yourself. And I was just wondering, where what has surprised you and what geographies you're talking about particularly in terms of a market, and in terms of your end volumes as you think about 2019? That's my first question, thank you.","Martin King","It's fairly broad based, but I would call out the EU as the one area that is exceeding its previous run rate or and maybe surprising us a little bit to the positive this year. Poland is one market that's doing well. I mean, it's overall EU run rate used to be around 2% to 3% and now we're seeing it running more like 1% to 2%. With so far this year, it's been quite encouraging. But we're also seeing pretty good volumes across a number of other geographies the Turkish market in the first half of the year is still up. Indonesia market has started to grow again with no tax increase and with limited pricing this year because of not having the tax, and you have a couple other markets at least for the first half of the year that are benefiting from lapping some previous big tax increases and so forth like Saudi is up compared to last year, Thailand is up pretty strongly even though it's not such a big market but it is a pretty strong size growth there.","So it's fairly broad based, but I would -- I would pick out the EU is the one that's probably a little bit more than what we expected.","Adam Spielman","And just the market, and for you specifically is it just, I guess, our peers are doing better than expected or is there anything else, or is it just the those are favorable markets here, Indonesia Turkey, EU, Saudi all big markets where you have decent market shares?","Martin King","Yes, well I mean you see our overall share is benefiting from heated tobacco units. And even within the cigarette category, we're doing pretty well. We called out this quarter wasn't quite as favorable as last quarter on cigarette share, but Turkey was one of one of the main reasons and the issue in Turkey was that, we increased prices and we're the only ones in the market with the higher prices for about a month. The competition lagged a bit, and so we lost quite a bit of share in the second quarter. However, competition has lost and we don't expect -- Turkey with Marlboro in Parliament. They're recovering quite quickly.","So that was a bit of a Q2 anomaly. So overall our share in cigarettes, within cigarettes is holding up very nicely and of course we're benefiting from the overall strategy of leading the heated tobacco space as you know approximately two out of every three consumers coming in the category are coming from the competition. So overall our share is holding up very nicely we're quite pleased with it.","Adam Spielman","And just very quickly. A second point, you mentioned at the beginning a couple of times, but you had more pricing variance this quarter. And I guess you implied there's going to be sort of slightly reverse in Q3 because the impression you gave was you took earlier prices in 2019 than you did in the corresponding markets in 2018.","But I was just wondering sort of can you be a little bit more specific about what markets you're talking about? And also why did you do that? It seems a sort of slightly strange thing to do. It's a bit more of a color around that pricing variance thing moved a bit further forward in the year.","Martin King","Yes I mean, first of all with pricing you kind of take it when you can get it. It's not that we try to stick to a certain schedule. We read the competitive situation and the overall gaps and various other measures and we take the pricing is as we think we can achieve it. One market to call out as having shifted from where it was in Q3 last year into Q2 this year is Mexico. So you had the trade movements benefiting Q2 and the pricing benefiting Q2 this year where it was in Q3 last year. And the other piece on the comparisons to last year is, last year\u2019s pricing variance in Q3 was very large, it was the biggest of any of the quarters. It was $483 million. So just because of the way the timing works out and the different sequencing, you get some quarters that are bigger than others, and when pricing moved from one quarter to another, it can have a pretty significant impact on the total revenue line.","So yes, 9% total revenue growth in quarter two ex-currency like-for-like is very, very strong, but it is flatter by these movements by about 2%. So we wanted to call that out, and also make sure people understood the impact as we make the comparison against Q3 coming up.","Adam Spielman","Again, I've got lots more questions, but I'll leave it at that, so that the other folks have a go. Thank you.","Martin King","Okay, thanks Adam.","Operator","Our next question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong","Thank you. Hi, Martin.","Martin King","Hi Judy.","Judy Hong","So my first question is just your decision to spend incremental hundred million behind IQOS this year. I know you kind of gave the big buckets of where you think the investment will go, but I guess, I just wanted to get a little bit more clarity around just some of the specific programs and in mind for the spending.","And then if we should think about this as more of a pull forward from kind of the planned spending next year as the underlying momentum has come in a bit better than expected.","Martin King","Okay. Yes, I mean there are a couple of broad areas where the spending will help us maintain our momentum going into next year and really beyond. I mean one is, to accelerate the development of innovation of both the product side and on the commercial side and that will have more of a long term benefit. I mean that's something where it's not likely to help us this year, but it will help us next year with some of our innovation coming out at a faster pace and some additional projects that we can we can accomplish.","So that's more of a long term investment, and very much a confidence on our strategy and realizing that, that in order to stay ahead of the competition we've got to continue with our innovation pipeline.","The second piece is around geographic expansion. We've had great success in Russia and the EU, and we've pointed out that geographically we still have opportunities to expand in both areas. So accelerating those plans ahead of more competitive presence is prudent. And then we also have some new geographies that we will open in the second half of the year and funding that appropriately to get off to a really good start is I think an excellent use of additional investments to get momentum going into next year.","And that's really what I would sort of say staying ahead in the areas where we're -- where we're doing well and opening up some new areas. And then the third bucket is investments to address intensifying competition. I mean, I guess the best examples that are going to be Japan and Korea. We do have new innovation improvement on our IQOS3 device. And we want to get that out there in a in a big way and benefit from it. It's an excellent innovation and it helps us have news and, and a reason for IQOS users to really stick with IQOS in the face of having lots of other products being offered to them and so forth.","And then there's also in that same bucket I think commercial activities, which I won't specify, but which we will put aside some additional investments for given that the competition is putting more intensity into these markets as they realize that they need to try to catch up in the reduced risk space that we've built.","So those are I think prudent investments. It's about momentum and it's a bit of success, breeds success because we've been able to do well this year and get ahead. And then that allows us to up the ante and keep our momentum going, not just finishing this year well, which we need to do, but more importantly for next year and beyond. These are these are long term plays so I hope that covers that Judy.","Judy Hong","Yes, that's helpful. I guess a bit of a follow up and my second question was actually going to be on Japan and Korea and some of the competitive dynamics that you've talked about. I guess in Japan, you've had some new activities in place now for I guess six, six months plus, market share being kind of flattish. How would you think about that in the context of some of the investments that have already been made? And then, can you be a little bit more specific in what the improvement on IQOS3 devices that that we'll see with the launch in the back half? Thanks.","Martin King","Okay. So, for Japan, I mean, we have to keep in mind that we're up 1.1 share points year to-date over last year. So yes, sequentially we only had very slight growth on an offtake basis from Q1 to Q2, but that's already on a base that's well stepped up from our run rate last year. So, our initiatives are clearly working. The introduction of HEETS at the different price point and with the different taste lineup to attract the different consumer group is definitely working, its incremental share we're getting, and it's more mainstream brand that opens its access to more consumers.","We've had very good feedback on the IQOS 3 and MULTI. The battery works better charges between usages for IQOS 3 much quicker. The design it is well received. And the evidence is that despite the price tiering where 2.4+ is available in the market at a lower price nearly all of the purchases and all the volume, the vast majority have gone IQOS 3 and MULTI. So it shows that the consumer there has appreciated that innovation. And our salesforce is working effectively to convert adult smokers that overall category has grown and as I mentioned before our HEETS and HeatStick share has grown and we expect that to continue going forward.","Now obviously there is going to be some more competitive activity in the second half. So we'll see out there may be some short-term impact with consumers trying other products and so forth, but we're convinced that our product is still the best choice in the marketplace and we're to keep investing behind it. And the IQOS 3 improvements we think will help consumers see new innovation from us as well as the competitive offerings. I'm not to get any further details on what that improvement is as you can imagine we'd like to keep it in surprise for now. But I think its improvement that consumers will really appreciate.","Pleased with Japan's performance; obviously we're watching very closely the competitive situation and that certainly \u2013 the first half of the year only behind us. We still have the second half to go and I think that's one area where we have to keep our eyes short and make sure we're addressing the competitive situation in Japan as well as in Korea.","Judy Hong","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog","Alright. Thank you. Hello, Martin.","Martin King","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog","Hi. I wanted to also ask about a little bit further on some of the things that you are just discussing. And I kind of wanted to hear maybe more specifically how consumers have been responding to more of the competitor innovation that's been rolling out in the market? Are they simply trying the new renovation and then possibly coming back to IQOS? Or do you think you're experiencing some share loss as these consumers are switching or is it possible that some of the new innovation by your competitors is helping to convert more smokers and driving a larger reduced risk markets?","Martin King","I would say that, it's different between the two markets, between Japan and Korea. In Japan, I think we have seen the period of churn and we have more consumers that are actually settling back with IQOS. Obviously, there would be a new wave of expansion coming from some of the device sales especially from JT, so there maybe another phase. But overall in Japan I think the initiatives we took are having a good affect, our share growth is up from last year nicely and we see that our position is pretty firm and that we're growing the category and growing our share moving forward. So, in Japan well obviously we'll keep an eye on the competition. We feel pretty confident going forward.","In Korea, it's a little bit more intense competition. KT&G's device has a lineup of consumables in a taste direction, non-menthol flavors that are kind of unique to Korea if you will. Korea is a country that has an overall trend not just in tobacco but in other categories of all kinds of exotic flavors and its present in the tobacco area as well. And KT&G has done a very good job of capitalizing on this. It's not just by the way in the area of heat-not-burn, it's also in the cigarette category that they have put out a large number of new offerings with all kinds of exotic flavors, but within the heat-not-burn area we feel more confident to respond and offer some additional flavors in our lineup and we will come with that in the second half of the years. So we'll have to see how those competitive responses get traction.","We think we will do better going forward and we're also putting more attention to conversion and some of the other activities in the marketplace in Korea. But right now our results in Korea are in need of some remedial action and that's we're taking, going forward in the second half of the year, whereas in Japan I think we're on firm footing and we're quite confident going forward.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's help. And then in light of all this as the competitive landscape intensifies; how or where you seeing pricing heading for reduced risk products? How concerned are you that pricing is going to start to roll back and effort for possibly you to defend share. Just trying to get a sense of the evolution of pricing in the reduced risk market over time?","Martin King","Well, I think you need to separate out consumable pricing versus device pricing. On the consumables we have absolutely no indication of any sort of pricing issues or skirmishes. And in fact for example in Japan when overall prices went up last year with the tax increase, the pricing went through on RRPs as well as on cigarette. And we don't see any sign anywhere of the actual, consumables being a big issue from the pricing perspective.","Now on the devices, there are some countries where the competition has offered very low prices on devices. We are always priced well above competition and surgically and where necessary we have and we'll continue to offer discounts to promotions to keep our devices from being too high on price and we will need to keep doing that. But that's a much more manageable issues, I mean the value of converting a consumer it's really in the consumable and making sure that you're in the mix for devices on device pricing is a relatively more manageable economic challenge than having to do with the consumable side. So overall I would say pricing in the category is not a major issue. Its small skirmishes in certain countries, certain places with the devices where we're going to have to continue to make sure we're being competitive.","Bonnie Herzog","Okay. That's helpful. And just one final quick question on your guidance from me. You're increasing your spending slightly, but you noted you still expect your margins to be just as strong. So, can you highlight for us what the key offset is or what is expected to perform better specifically as it relates to your margins?","Martin King","Well, I mean, I think that the top line increase allowed for a bit more spending while keeping the margin still where it was before, and I think if you put that through the model I think you'll see that's more or less what it is. I mean, obviously we're very mindful of our spending and working hard to get efficiencies. You see us moving forward on our footprint as we've announced some factories. We did Pakistan before. We're doing Columbia now. We've announced the intent and the beginning of consultations on Berlin.","We're working hard internally on our cost categories and bringing cost out and so forth. But most of those benefits you'll see more going forward in the next few years. It's not showing up so much already this year because you have to take the actions and of course incur the cost and treat people fairly and properly and then you get the lower cost base in the out years. So I think the 100 million is really within the realm of the higher revenue and keeping the EPS growth 1% higher as well.","Bonnie Herzog","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley.","Pamela Kaufman","Hi. Thanks for the question. In your comments about step-up of investment investing in Q3, you alluded to accelerating investments behind innovation. Will this happen specifically within heat-not-burn? Or will you be investing more behind vaping product. And also, what are your thoughts on M&A in vaping to extend your presence in the category?","Martin King","Yes. The investments are across several platforms including e-vapor. We continue with our plan to roll out the first initial market with \u2013 improve the cigarette with the mesh technology and then improved form factor and we're very confident that that product will be superior to what's in the marketplace. So we're continuing to vest behind the capacity ramp-up for that and we want to ramp the capacity as fast as we can and get to as many markets as we can next year.","As far as timing on spending, if you take the total of 400 million that we're now communicating on spending, about $120 million has been spent the first half leaving us about $280 million and then we said about 200 or half of the 400 will come in Q3. It's across various categories, not just the innovation you're asking about. But it's a broad-based commitment to the smoke-free future and all of our activities across commercial as well as product platforms as well as commercialization.","Pamela Kaufman","Thanks. And how are you thinking about IQOS's ramp in the U.S. Can you help us think about the potential contribution to your results as it scale?","Martin King","Well, I mean, I think we start with looking at the prospect for IQOS in the U.S. and I think it start with the consumer receptivity. And in our estimation U.S. consumers are very open to trying new products not just in the area of reduced risk tobacco product by the way, but also all products in general as compared to many other countries. U.S. consumers tend to embrace innovation pretty readily. And you certainly see it with the cigarette category and some of the other categories in the U.S. where consumers are trying to product, so that's a plus.","There's a pretty clear regulatory approach and we got clear guidance from FDA on some of the aspects of introducing this product in the U.S. There's good communication freedom that will help build awareness and trial amongst adult smokers. And then you've got Altria and PM USA. They have excellent execution ability. They're well prepared. They got a very strong plan. We've been working with them to share all the learnings, very good cooperation.","So we expect the U.S. to perform quite well. I mean, we would expect it to be faster on average than the EU has developed. I mean I think you have to be realistic. I wouldn't assume that it\u2019s going to take off like Japan did or Korea initially et cetera, but we expect U.S. to have very solid results. Now, of course, has yet to be started. We'll find out a lot from the Atlanta beginning and then we'll take it from there. But we have very high hopes and we're working very well together without you to make this a success.","Pamela Kaufman","Thanks. And one last question from me. Just curious about your early read on the competitive dynamics, from JUUL International expansion in Europe and Asia?","Martin King","Well, it is early days for JUUL. We're not seeing certainly any impact from JUUL on our overall results. As you can see there's really nowhere that we're having any issues with it, but it is early days. We're watching it closely. I mentioned staying ahead of competition with expansion and staying ahead of competition, it's mostly we're talking about heat-not-burn, but it\u2019s also quite frankly with an eye toward JUUL as well and making sure that we get as much awareness and trial and presence throughout the EU and Russia and places like that as we have this great momentum and we're doing extremely well and as within eye also to the fact that others are coming amongst them JUUL.","So we have our eye on it. We're taking steps including with the e-cigarette platform for investment and rollout that we talked about and I mentioned earlier to make sure that we're going to compete well with JUUL. Nonetheless of course there's room for more than one on successful product in this category and JUUL will likely get some success. So we're realistic about it as well.","Pamela Kaufman","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Rampton of UBS.","Robert Rampton","Good morning. Three questions from me. The first question is -- so your disclose market for down around 1%, if you could help me with the bridge to the 2.5 for the full year?","Martin King","The 2.5 is a reference to the total market for tobacco and heated tobacco units worldwide and the 1% it's our shipment rate. So, I'm not sure. Maybe I didn't get your question.","Robert Rampton","So, I'm referring to your key market data at the back which says the total market units were down 1.1%. I appreciate that doesn't cover 100% of your [Indiscernible] I guess what I'm asking is, what did the industry do in 1H and then how do we bridge from that to the full year?","Martin King","The total industry in the first half was down a bit less than the two and a half and would be down a bit more than two and a half, obviously, in the second half to bring it back to that. I don't have the exact number.","Robert Rampton","Yes. I mean there's going to be pricing throughout the year and you have a normal decline rates throughout various countries. Turkey's pricing that went into effect in April in Turkey. Turkey was growing quite rapidly last year and into the first quarter, but obviously it was a pretty big tax hence we've now taken pricing to Turkish Lira per pack, so that market price won't grow quite as fast as it was. I mean there's various market events that infer that the second half will be a bit weaker than the first half for both total market and for our own shipments too by the way because we're more or less flat in the first half. We're saying we're going down one for the year, so obviously our second half shipment volume will be down roughly to 2%. Does that help, Robert?","Robert Rampton","Yes. That's very helpful indeed. So next question was on inventory in Japan, so last year there was a 4, 3Q there was a 4 billion gap between your shipment number and you\u2019re in-market sales. I mean clearly some of that will be loading ahead of the tax change, but how should we think about the lapping of that in the context of the difficult pricing comparatively flat?","Martin King","Yes. I mean, there are couple moving parts in Japan that have impacts on inventories especially one quarter the next. I mean as you point out we had the pricing last year. We obviously drew down the inventory because we had a different projection for the market than what we started the year. This year you have a VAT increase expected October 1st going from 8% VAT to 10% VAT. That's across the whole market not just tobacco, but all products. But obviously, consumers are going to expect that there might be some pantry loading and trade movements from that.","There's also a health warning change coming next year, so inventories have to be managed to deal with that. So there are quite a few moving parts. I mean, obviously, we've made the statement that overall worldwide we expect total heated tobacco unit shipments to be more or less in line within market sales, in other words if there's inventory up in one market down in another market, but overall it should be more or less flat. I can't really give you that individual where each market is going to end up. Even Japan given these many moving parts.","And you have to remember inventories are really set. As we go into the end of the year with an eye towards what we think is going to happen in the next year that's the whole reason to have the inventory, is decide as to what's coming and what events are coming as well. So it's a bit difficult to give you any more details on what's coming up for inventories other than that broad statement that we expect in market sales and shipments to be approximately the same this year and not have big inventory differences.","Robert Rampton","Okay. That makes sense. Sorry, one last question just in terms of IQOS share in Greece and Bulgaria, that moved backwards quarter on quarter, obviously I'm not trying to say anything about in proposition, but I'm just wondering in those markets. Is that a function of the bigger weight of 2Q versus other quarters or is it a case that you get to a certain point in development of a market where you start getting the initial churn or is it you've redirected resource?","Martin King","Well, I mean you have to keep in mind there's some volatility in the numbers, but if you look at Greece the share is 8.1, up four from the prior year, so it's doubled, right? So there might be just like we saw in Russia for example where the overall IMS is growing at a very steady, very nice rate. But you saw the share moving around, Q1 was overstated because of cigarette seasonality and now when you when you look at the underlying and understand the situation the Russia share growth has been growing and growing steadily.","But it's distorted by these other movements and its similar things happen in other markets. But when you look at the longer term both you called out Greece, it's doubled in the last year to 8% up 4%. Bulgaria's is more than double. It's grown two and a half to four and a half. So when you look at one quarter to another quarter with those kinds of growth rates I don't think that's really the best way to look at it. But we're growing well in both those locations.","Robert Rampton","Okay great. Thanks very much. Appreciate the time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray.","Michael Lavery","Thank you. Could you just unpack the third quarter a little bit more and especially in light of the VAT increase in Japan and what should be relatively profitable trade loading. How should we think about the revenues still in the quarter being below your full year range? And why would that be the case?","Martin King","Well, I mean, one of the biggest impacts is this timing that we talked about, where the Q2 is benefiting by about two percentage points. And that's obviously going to drag on Q3 on the top line. And then when you look at it year-over-year we had this very large pricing variance last year of $483 million. And while we'll have decent pricing this year as well, it won't be nearly that big in the quarter. And you add to that this spending step up which is very much concentrated in that quarter. And that's how we get to the overall picture of essentially flat with the pro forma from last year at 135.","I mean that's pretty much the basics of it. I mean obviously there are individual events in certain countries like Japan and so forth in one year to next year. But if you look at the bigger picture those are pretty big movements and significant numbers that affected. I remember last year Japan had a price increase in the same pattern, right? It was October 1st. So you had trade loading and et cetera. So when you do it this year you have a VAT instead of the price -- instead of the tax, I'm sorry. But you have a similar potential for trade dynamics that are at really the same date. So I don't think that that's going to be a big driver of it year-over-year.","Michael Lavery","Are you anticipating having pricing go through with this tax hike as well?","Martin King","We never discuss forward pricing. The VAT is going to go up, that's all we can really know at this point in time. We'll have to see what happens as far as any anything else. ","And we usually have to discuss with the government you're pricing ahead of time and so forth, so it's not always very clear as to what's going to happen.","Michael Lavery","Yes, of course. And just back on the spending piece of it, can you unpack the incremental 100 million a bit. You mentioned that half of it is going to fall on the third quarter. Is the rest in the fourth? Or has some of that already happened?","Martin King","Just to be clear, we took the 100 million increase added it to the 300 million that we had already said would occur. That's a total of 400. Half of that i.e. 200 million step up will occur we believe in the third quarter. That's why it's a pretty big impact. It's not just the 100 million. It's 200 million of step up out of the total of 400 million that we expect to hit in Q3. That's why it's a pretty big impact.","Michael Lavery","That's helpful clarity. And some of that timing just driven by opportunistic ability to reinvest some of the momentum ahead of your plans. Is that how the 3Q surge hits from the pacing perspective?","Martin King","Yes. I mean we've only spent 120 million so far this year in the first half. Some of it was by design and some of it was some timing slipping and some things like that. As it turns out, Q3 is actually a very good time for us to step up this investment because we get some time through the year to benefit from the geographic expansions that we're going to do and we've been planning them already now. There's much of that's out of the original 300, the 100 million on top as we go and try to address better some of the competitive situations and work on our longer term innovation.","Q3 is when we can get things rolling and get -- the commensurate spending that goes with it hits the timing. So yes, it just so happens that the concentration of the 200 out of the four falling into one quarter. But it's a variety of different things driving that.","Michael Lavery","That's helpful. And then just one more on the U.K. Obviously, it's been a -- there's some severe restrictions on your ability to communicate and market much about IQOSs, but it -- you're starting to expand in Bristol and Manchester now. It also was in the news that there's been 100,000 devices sold in London over the last couple of years and some of those obviously could be in the hands of multiple, but people could have more than one, no question, but that might be something in the neighborhood of a high single-digit share of London smokers. How is your progression in London? Is it gaining a little bit more traction and starting to have some good share runway there?","Martin King","Yes. I mean, our share in London is relatively small. It's above 1%. But it's relatively small. It's bigger in certain pockets like around Canary Wharf, West London, we have pretty significant share. We have really good conversion rates in U.K. and London at 70%, so the people who do buy the devices successfully convert and for the most part quit smoking and switch completely to heat-not-burn. We're continuing to invest as you pointed out by opening stores in Bristol and Manchester. So we're making headway.","As you pointed out it hasn't been easy due to the regulatory setup and some other issues. We have to keep in mind London is like a crossroads of the world. So you have a lot of people to visit London that might buy a device, but not actually consume HeatSticks in London. So when I give you market share, I'm talking about HeatStick offtake share, but obviously you would have devices that would be purchased by people visiting London from various countries. You might have also Londoners who travel quite a bit buying HeatSticks in the EU and bringing them back as long as they stay within certain limits they can do that. And prices are much lower, say in Italy your price for HeatSticks in Italy is about significantly lower than what it is in London.","So you get a lot of that going on. So I think probably London is a bit of a unique situation where the number of devices sold doesn't match up very as closely as you might think with the offtake share of the consumables. But I think it's a worthwhile endeavor for us to keep working on awareness and conversion of people in London because it is a leading city in the world and one that helps set worldwide trends. So we keep chipping away at it. We are making progress. We'll continue to do that.","Michael Lavery","That's helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Gaurav Jain of Barclays.","Gaurav Jain","Thank you for taking my question. And this is a follow-up on that question that was earlier on the sequential market share in Bulgaria and Greece. So if I look at Japan, IQOS stalled after having penetrated the early after market and the overall HTU category share has been stable at around 21%, 22%. Now in Vilnius in Lithuania you were already at 20% share in Q1. And if we look at the Lithuania market share, they are up very slightly. So what I'm trying to ask is, are you hitting the limits of early adopters in some of these Eastern European cities and countries already?","Martin King","Well, I mean, the only one that would be kind of at the level where you might think that there might be some challenging would be Vilnius which is at as you said 20%, and it really all depends on the dynamics of the pricing of the offer if you're running out of people that are in the premium category that can sometimes have an effect. But overall it when you look at EU and even Russia, we still have quite a bit of runway to go before I think we'll start to hit issues where you say, I've converted the vast majority of premium smokers or I have converted the vast majority of the early adopters and innovators.","And even now, even when that starts to happen we're now much more prepared for that because we know obviously you need to be prepared to make sure you have offerings that span the different price tiers. You need to be prepared to have the messaging in place for different groups. So, obviously it's something we keep an eye on and we build the toolbox to be able to move to a different strategy when you start hitting those levels. But in the EU frankly, I think we're still in aggregate anyway far far away from it. Keep in mind Lithuania and Vilnius are relatively small geographies within the EU.","So I don't see it as an overall issue for our growth rates in the EU. We're on a good trajectory and I expect us to continue to be growing nicely for quite some time to come. But we are prepared and aware of it and have the toolboxes and strategy for those sorts of situations. Thank you for your question.","Gaurav Jain","Okay. Okay. Can I ask one follow up question? You are increasing your revenue growth guidance this year to 6% but not the three year guidance from greater than 5%. So shouldn't that be also increased a bit now, because you are increasing the guidance in the first year itself?","Martin King","That's not how we've set up the three year. We gave it as a compound annual growth rate. Obviously when we get into next year, we'll give some guidance for next year and we'll see how things are going before we do that. We're not prepared to do that, and we wouldn't change the three year overall based on just this just this period.","Gaurav Jain","Sure. Thank you. Thanks a lot.","Martin King","Thank you very much.","Operator","And that was our final question. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Martin King","Yes I just wanted to leave three key takeaways. First one being, we've got very strong momentum as evidenced by our total volume, which is which is actually slightly positive on a like-for-like basis in the first half and it's both the conventional and the heated tobacco units which are performing well. Second is that our strategy is working for the shareholders. We've got the top line benefits that are flowing through, with our margin expansion of at least 100 basis points currency-neutral that we expect for this year, and this has given us the confidence to increase our investment to maintain this momentum into 2020 and beyond. We're focusing on the longer term, with the product and commercial development. We're focusing on geographic expansion. We're addressing competition to maintain our favorable competitive lead. And when you put all three of those things together, we're in pretty good shape for the first half of the year. We definitely have still the second half to go and there's some countries in areas that we have to make sure where we're keeping an eye on amongst them, Turkey with the pricing in Indonesia, with some down trading and so forth. We've got the increased competition on heat-not-burn, but when you put it all together, we're confident in the future and we're ready to have a good second half and move into 2020. So thank you very much for listening.","Nick Rolli","Thank you very much for joining us today on the call. If you have any follow up questions please contact the IR team.

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International's management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2012 first quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call today, we'll be talking about results for the first quarter 2012 and comparing them with the same period in 2011, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes. Operating companies income, or OCI, is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You'll find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. ","It's now my pleasure to introduce Hermann Waldemer, our Chief Financial Officer. Hermann?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We once again achieved excellent results in the first quarter of this year. Our organic cigarette volume increased by 5.3%. Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, were up by 10.9%. Adjusted OCI, also excluding currency and acquisition, increased by 14.2%. And our adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, rose by 19.8%.","Our strong business momentum continues, and this should enable us to perform well during the remainder of 2012, notwithstanding the previously disclosed difficult comparisons versus 2011 that we will face in the second quarter relating to the exceptional circumstances in the Japanese market during the post-tsunami crisis. Consequently, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve the business results that we predicted when we issued our reported 2012 EPS guidance last February. However, since that time, the U.S. dollar has strengthened against a number of currencies. As a result, we are facing a slightly stronger currency headwind and are now forecasting an impact of $0.15 in unfavorable currency this year based on prevailing exchange rates compared to the $0.10 previously disclosed in February. As a result, for exchange rate reasons only, we are revising our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2012 by $0.05 to a range of $5.20 to $5.30. It should be stressed that compared to our 2011 adjusted diluted EPS of $4.88, we are maintaining our forecast growth in the reported diluted EPS for 2012 of approximately 10% to 12% on a currency-neutral basis. Our forecast growth is fully in line with our long-term growth target for adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency.","One of the key elements favorably impacting our business is the reasonable excise tax environment. While there have been increases, most recently in Spain, we have not seen any disruptively large changes in any key markets this year. On the structural side, we continue to witness further improvements via a gradual increase in the specific proportion of excise taxes. Many governments now recognize that higher specific elements reinforce the predictability of government tobacco excise tax revenues.","Pricing continues to be the most important single driver of our profitability. The pricing variance was $369 million in the quarter. The increased prices, notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines and Russia, and continued to benefit from the annualization of higher prices from last year. We also generated a positive volume mix variance of $224 million at the OCI level as we grew volume and benefited from consumer up-trading in a wide range of non-OECD markets. ","The 5.3% quarterly organic cigarette volume growth is our best performance since the March 2008 spin. While boosted by the leap year and an undemanding comparison to the prior year, the improvement was notable for its wide geographic spread. The Asia region led the way with a 12.4% increase. The growth in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions was around 3%. And the moderate decline in the EU region of 1.5% was the best performance in many years. In fact, volume increased in the first quarter in 13 of our top 15 largest markets by volume. ","This performance reflects the breadth of our superior brand portfolio. In the first quarter, every one of our top 10 brands by volume grew. The small growth, notably adding 3.6 billion units compared to the first quarter of 2011. ","We are thus able to continue our strong market share growth momentum. Our market share in our top 30 OCI markets was estimated at 37.3% in the first quarter of 2012 compared to 36.6% for the full year 2011 and 35.5% in 2010.","Asia is our principal growth engine. The region as a whole is benefiting from a solid economic environment, a growing adult population in many markets and increasing consumer purchasing power. Our organic cigarette volume grew by 12.4%, led by Indonesia. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 16.3% and 23.7%, respectively. ","Total industry volume in Indonesia grew at a double-digit pace in the first quarter. On a full year basis, we forecast an increase in the range of 6% to 8%. Meanwhile, our shipment volume grew by 24.9% in the quarter, making Indonesia the single largest market for PMI by shipment size. Our market share was 3.5% higher at 33.4%. This tremendous result was achieved through the excellent momentum behind our leading machine-made, premium lower tar nicotine brand, Sampoerna A, and the strength of our overall portfolio, which also includes premium Marlboro, mid-price U Mild and low-price brands. Our premium portfolio added over 3 billion units and accounted for over 60% of our market share gain in the quarter. ","The underlying trend in Japanese industry volume has continued to improve. We are forecasting a moderate underlying market decline of approximately 2% in 2012 as smoking incidence has remained stable since the middle of last year. Our first quarter market share was 28%, well above the previous year at 25.6% and just slightly below the fourth quarter 2011 level. Our share was impacted by trade purchases of new JT products in March when it dropped to 27.3%. So far, we have had just one new launch this year, Lark Hybrid 100 millimeter, which achieved a satisfactory 4.4% market share in March. Both Marlboro and Lark remain strong, and we have a full pipeline of new consumer innovative variants that we plan to launch in the coming months.","In Korea, we implemented in mid-February a price increase of KRW 200 per pack to KRW 2,700 on Marlboro, Parliament and Lark, which accounted for over 80% of our volume in 2011, while making some necessary practical price adjustments to Virginia Slims. The preliminary indications are that as expected, we have given back a large part of the share gains from the previous temporary price advantage in return for a significant margin improvement. Our endeavors to secure a reasonable long-term reform of excise taxation has been delayed by the parliamentary elections that took place early this month, but we will renew our efforts now that they are over.","Our results in the EEMA region were very strong in the quarter. Organic cigarette volume grew by 3.4%, driven in particular by Algeria, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and only partly offset by a reduction in sales in Egypt due to a surge in illicit trade. Our mix was favorable as adult smokers traded up to premium and mid-price brands. We increased prices in the quarter, most notably in Russia. And pricing was also a key driver of our higher profitability. Excluding currency and acquisitions, net revenues and adjusted OCI were 12.6% and 18% higher, respectively, while we continued increase our investments behind Marlboro and other key brands.","The strength of the economy has enabled the Turkish market to rapidly absorb the impact of the tax-driven price increases that occurred in the fourth quarter of last year. Our volume increased by nearly 10% in the first quarter of this year as our portfolio continued to perform strongly. And our year-to-date February Nielsen share grew by 0.7 point to 44.6%. Our mix has also improved behind premium Parliament and mid-price Muratti. ","In Russia, recent price increases have not prevented adult smokers' appetite for up-trading. Our above-premium brand, Parliament, continues to perform very strongly and gained a further 0.3 point to reach a record 3.2% Nielsen share year-to-date February. Along with the strong performance of low-price Bond Street and Next Slims, this has enabled us to grow our overall Nielsen share through the end of February from 25.5% last year to 26.2%. We remain optimistic that we can further strengthen our position in Russia as the preliminary results of our new marketing programs and additional investments behind the Marlboro and other key brands are showing early signs of promise. ","In the EU region, total industry volume was down a modest 1.3% despite weak economic conditions, notably in Greece and Spain. Both L&M and Chesterfield continue to gain share in the region. Their market shares were up 0.3 and 0.4 point, respectively, to a combined 9.8%. L&M is growing in particular in Germany, Poland and Slovakia, while Chesterfield is performing particularly well in Austria, Portugal and Spain. Marlboro's performance remains resilient though its market share was down in the region as a whole by 0.3 point to 17.5%. Marlboro gained share notably in Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Hungary and Portugal, while its share loss in Germany was attributable to a temporary price disadvantage. Higher prices, notably in France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. enabled us to return to solid profit growth in the region. Net revenues and adjusted OCI were 5.3% and 3.7% higher, respectively, excluding currency. During the quarter, we continued to invest behind the new Marlboro campaign and consumer element innovative line extensions, such as Marlboro Beyond.","Unemployment continues to increase in Spain with no short-term expectation for any improvement. This is putting further pressure on the total market volume for cigarettes. During the first quarter, PMI's market share declined slightly to 30.2% despite an improved performance for Chesterfield. As part of their measures to reduce the budget deficit, the Spanish government recently increased excise taxes on cigarettes, along with a restructuring that increased the relative importance of the specific element. In response, we raised our prices by EUR 0.25 per pack across our portfolio despite the government's failure to increase the minimum excise tax.","In Italy, cigarette industry volume declined by 6.1% in the first quarter, partly offset by strong growth in the fine cut market which remains relatively small at around 6% of total tobacco consumption. The key drivers of this decline are higher prices that have boosted industry margins and government revenues and more difficult economic conditions. While unemployment still remains below 10% in Italy, consumer purchasing power is under pressure. There has therefore been some customer down-trading from premium and mid-price cigarettes to low-price international cigarette brands and fine cut. This led to an erosion of 0.9 point in our cigarette market share to 52.6% in the first quarter. To address these trends, we launched Chesterfield fine cut in the second quarter of 2011. This move has reinforced the brand as it has steadily increased its share of the total tobacco market and enabled us to achieve market leadership in fine cut in the first quarter of this year with a 28.3% share. Our latest initiative was the launch during the first quarter of this year of Philip Morris Selection in the growing international low-price cigarette category, where we are underrepresented. Along with the higher prices, these strategies should enable us to maintain our profitability in this important market going forward. ","The economies in the northern part of Europe show more favorable trends as illustrated by Germany. Cigarette industry volume was up 3.1% in the first quarter as the economy remained robust and contraband was reduced. The German authority recently closed down 2 important smuggling rings, whose annual supply was estimated at some 400 million cigarettes. Marlboro was the first key brand to be sold in Germany at higher prices following the January tax increase and thus suffered a market share decline in the first quarter of 0.8 point to 20.4%. Nearly all competitive brands are now selling at new prices, so we expect an improved Marlboro performance going forward. Our optimism is backed by the promising results from the initial phases of the new Marlboro \"Don't Be A Maybe\" campaign. Marlboro's share amongst young adult smokers, minimum 18 to 24 years old, increased by 5 points in the first quarter to become the leading brand in this adult age group, along with L&M with a 20% smokers share for each of the 2 brands. ","PMI achieved an overall increase of 0.2 point in its cigarette market share in the first quarter at 35.9%. This was driven by the continued strong performance of L&M. The brand grew a further 1.2 share points in the quarter to 11.2%. As this remains well below its young adult smokers share, we expect to be able to continue to expand L&M share in the German market going forward. We also successfully increased our quarterly share in the fine cut market, with a gain of 0.9 point to 15.8%. This was driven by our 2 key cigarette brands, Marlboro and L&M. ","The Latin America and Canada region was a solid contributor, again, in the quarter. Organic cigarette volume grew by 2.9%, thanks to share and market growth in Argentina and favorable timing and trade inventory movements in Mexico. We increased our share in Colombia and Mexico, where Marlboro continued to perform well, with gains of 1.5 and 4 points, respectively. Excluding currency, adjusted OCI increased by 4%.","On a global basis, the illicit trade in cigarettes is estimated at some 600 billion units. While at times a risk, it also offers PMI a very significant volume and profitability opportunity. The potential benefits of cooperation underpin our joint efforts with many authorities across the world. Canada, Germany and Romania are recent examples of successful reductions in contraband. In this context, we welcome measures being proposed by the provincial government in Ontario to reinforce its laws against illicit trade. Based on similar measures, the Qu\u00e9bec government has stated that it increased its provincial tobacco tax revenues by more than $200 million over the last 2 years.","Free cash flow was $1.7 billion in the first quarter, a decline of 23% excluding currency. Net earnings increased by $245 million, or 12.3%, confirming that the business fundamentals are in excellent shape. This was, however, more than offset by $742 million increase in our working capital and other requirements due mainly to the timing of receivables in the quarter and industry forestalling in the EU region, a phenomenon that should be fully reversed as the year unfolds. Let me remind you that forestalling occurs when manufacturers build up inventory in excess of normal supply chain requirement ahead of an excise tax increase. This competitive phenomenon becomes an issue whenever the payment of the excise taxes occurs prior to the depletion of the finished goods inventory. We are therefore working with governments to introduce and, when necessary, reinforce anti-forestalling measures. This would reduce our working capital requirements and provide governments with higher tax revenues without undue delay.","In addition, capital expenditures are higher this year. We are investing in productivity-enhancing factory modernization, equipment for innovative new products, the consolidation of our operations in the Philippines, the expansion of our capacity in Indonesia and other projects. At the same time, we are on track to deliver on our $300 million pretax productivity target in 2012. ","During the first quarter, we spent $1.5 billion to repurchase 18.1 million shares at an average price of $83.07. Our target remains to spend $6 billion on share repurchases this year. Since the spin through the end of March this year, we repurchased a total of 432.1 million shares at an average price of $52.88. Our annualized dividend of $3.08 per share generated an attractive yield of 3.5% at the market close last Friday. Since 2008, we have increased our dividend rate by 67.4% under our policy that targets a 65% dividend payout ratio. We continue to generate superior shareholder returns compared to our tobacco peers, our wider consumer product peers group and the broader market. ","In conclusion, the first quarter of 2012 has been another excellent one for PMI. Organic volume was very strong, and we benefited from consumer up-trading in non-OECD markets. All our key brands are performing well, led by Marlboro and Parliament. We are fully on track to deliver again in 2012 against our currency-neutral, long-term target of 10% to 12% adjusted diluted EPS growth. In the first quarter, we once more outperformed our tobacco and broader consumer product peers in terms of shareholder returns. We remain very confident about our outlook for the remainder of the year and beyond, notwithstanding the difficult comparison we will face in the second quarter due to Japan. ","Thank you for your continued interest in our company and its excellent growth prospects. I'm now happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So just in terms of your guidance for the full year, notwithstanding the currency guidance change but just underlying x currency guidance, just because you had a pretty strong first quarter, it kind of implies that the rest of the year would show some slowdown in terms of the year-over-year. So other than the comparison issue, how are you thinking about the balance of the year? Are there anything just at the margin, whether at the macro level or competitive level, that's giving you some caution here? Or is it just really too early in the year and you just want to see how the year unfolds?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I think the most important point is really your last point. We are early in the year. Yes, we are facing a difficult comp in Q2. But the underlying business, as I said also in the prepared remarks, is in very good shape. We're very happy. There is no -- really no change in the business prospects that we had expected when we gave our initial guidance on the business side in February. It's just early in the year. There is always upside in life. There is also risks in business. That's why our guidance also is a guidance that spans $0.10.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then secondly in Japan, so it sounds like in March, the shipment share ticked down a little bit. Do you have the consumer offtake share for March? I'm just trying to understand how effective some of these competitive activities and the load then is translating at the consumer level.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes, I think -- I mean, if you look at really the shipment shares in January at 28.3, February at 28.5 and then March, 27.3, it is pretty obvious that it's influenced by competitive trade load. The fact, simply, is that we only have had so far one launch this year, the Lark Hybrid One 100s. In the same period, JT had 3 launches. Our pipeline is also there. This is going to come in the next months. So I think we are in a very good position. The market dynamics are back to normal. Again, the novelty impact is always there in Japan. You were asking for offtake shares. They are very, very slightly below 30%. So that's a very, very small decline to what we had seen the 2 months before. Also, that one, I would say, is driven by the novelty and the trial of new products that have come to the market.","Judy E. Hong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally in Europe, you called out the volume performance obviously down 1.5%. You had somewhat of an easy comp, but just in terms of the decline being more modest in that market, if you can just maybe more recently, some of the increased -- again, renewed concerns about the macros and the consumer sentiment there, how do you think about your ability to continue to see improvement in Western Europe?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, I think there are -- Europe is, of course, a mixed picture, as we all know. And if you just take the 2 extremes, if you like, on the growth and on the more difficult side, the German cigarette market has been growing 3.1% in the first quarter versus previous year. Whereas in Spain, while there was some growth, but there is really just, due to very, very undemanding comps in the first quarter of last year, that really the retailers have brought down their inventories quite a bit. The Spanish economy continues to be very difficult. Unemployment continues to increase. So I, again, would expect the Spanish market for the full year still to be down at least 10% again. So let's not be misled by the first quarter. There is quite a mixed picture, but if we really kind of step back for a moment and look at really what has happened more on a macro basis in terms of volume trends, then I would say, yes, the so-called more mature markets, the decline rates have really moderated if you compare that to, say, 3 years ago. At the same time, in a number of emerging markets, the growth rates actually have accelerated compared to 3 years ago. And that, of course, taken together, combined with our great portfolio and our momentum also in terms of market share, provides us with potential opportunities for further volume growth and for good performance that's more from a macro picture.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I know you normally don't talk about specifics about discrete quarters, Hermann, but given the unusual dynamics you faced in Q2 both with Japan and currency, is it realistic to expect EPS to be down in the second quarter? That's certainly my forecast at this point.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, David, we have never made really or given quarterly guidance. I won't do it now as well either. I mean, the 2 points really to keep in mind here are that the hurdle due to Japan is about $0.10, EPS cents. So the calculation there really is the market in Q2 in Japan was about 45 billion cigarettes, our market share was 42, our retention share is about 28. That makes a difference of 14. Multiplied on the market size is a volume hurdle of about 6.3. You take the margin, you take the cost, you deduct the tax, you divide by the number of shares, and that brings you to about the $0.10. So that I can confirm or reconfirm. We have said that before. And other than that, I would really revert you back to the full year guidance because that's what really counts and our continued conviction that business fundamentals are doing well. We are doing extremely well. Things are good. Things are in order, and they keep on going as we had expected from the very beginning of this year.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then 2 other things, Hermann. I think in your prepared remarks, you indicated an expectation for Japanese cigarette consumption to be down about 2%. Did I hear that correctly for the year?","Hermann G. Waldemer","That is correct, yes.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Why do you think it's getting better? Because even prior to the excise tax increase, that market's rate of decline was substantially higher and arguably getting worse, going from 3%, 4%, 5% to 6%.","Hermann G. Waldemer","That's correct. And as I said in the question before also, I mean, it's not only Japan -- that trend of moderating decline rates in the so-called mature markets is a Japanese sentiment, it's also a European sentiment. It's really hard to pinpoint that down to what it is. The fact really is, in Japan now, completely back to Japan, that actually, the smoking rate has been stable. Smoking incidence has been stable since at least middle of last year.","David J. Adelman - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, Hermann, with this continued growth in volumes in Indonesia, are there any issues on your capacity or the availability of cloves?","Hermann G. Waldemer","We are increasing capacity. That's part of the reason why CapEx is going up. Of course, we are adjusting our capacity to the needs there. On cloves, that's a cyclical harvest actually. Typically, you have a strong harvest in one year. You have a weaker harvest in the other year. 2011 was a weak year in terms of overall clove harvest. The indications for this year are good. It should be a strong harvest. And of course, that would lead to replenishment of the clove stocks that we would then, of course, perform.","Operator","Your next question comes from Bonnie Herzog on Wells Fargo Securities.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to start with a question on pricing. You mentioned you're clearly benefiting from price realization. So how realistic is it for this continue at these levels? And do you attribute this to your innovation effort, price management or more due to the health of the consumer? And then I'd just like to understand how aggressive you've been with your managing your GAAP?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, I would say managing price gaps has a lot to do with managing price structures and price -- tax structures, excuse me, not price structures, tax structures. And we have seen improvement in tax structures in many, many places. I give you a couple of recent examples. France increased the specific component at the end of last year. Spain, just right now, the excise tax increase there had at the same time are rebalancing from -- at the lower end to specific tax. They missed out on the minimum tax in Spain. Let's hope that it's going to be corrected going forward. Only at the beginning of this week, actually, in a press conference of the Deputy Prime Minister in Turkey and the Finance Minister in Turkey, they also announced that they will look at the structure of excise tax there without increasing overall tax burden and that will implement a specific element into the overall structure. Details, timing, all that remains to be seen. But that's, again, an important step forward. Again, also this week, a public announcement of President Putin in Russia that yes, there will be regular excise tax increases in Russia, but there shouldn't be any excessive excise tax increases there either. So a lot of improvement. Brazil earlier, where they began to do away with those many tax tiers that clearly were a disadvantage for Marlboro. So there is improvement in a lot of places and that helps. And then as well helps you and, as a consequence, helps us to put in the correct and the right price gaps.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then, Hermann, on volume, your volume growth was strong and then balanced across your region. And then drilling down into Asia, there is -- it sounds like a lot of the robust industry volume growth. I'd like to understand what's driving this growth other than, is it the growing population, GDP growth? Is it the consumer behavior, increased smoking incidence? I just kind of want to hear a little bit from you more color on this. And then understanding the underlying dynamics and then how sustainable this industry volume growth in Asia will be over the next 5 years?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes, I mean, if the origin is of course what you said, it is the overall economies. And many of those economies, take Indonesia as an example, have really excellent macroeconomic indicators. So Indonesia GDP growth is forecast at 6.5%. Consumer confidence is really high, inflation expectations of 5%, i.e., there is -- there are real wage increases there, so improved affordability. A growing adult population is, of course, another factor that plays in there. And when it all comes together and you have the right brands to compete in such a market, this is how you generate your volume growth, your market share growth overall. I mean, Indonesia, to stay with that example, has been growing a bit more than 12% in the first quarter. I don't expect that to happen for the full year, but I still expect a strong growth of about 6% to 8%. That factors in that in that market, eventually, the existing subsidies for fuel prices will be reduced. That's going to take out a little bit of the purchasing power. That's the reason why I would expect the 6% to 8%. But a 6% to 8% is, of course, again very strong growth. And in the Indonesian market, just to compare, it will now be well above 300 billion, i.e., at the size of the U.S. market or even slightly bigger.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then just a final question on your forecast for volume for the year, given the strength, I think you had talked about flattish growth for 2012 in terms of volume. Is it realistic to assume that you're going to see faster, maybe low single digit volume growth this year?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I would say, including the Japanese hurdle, I would continue to expect stable volume, eventually slight growth. If you would exclude the Japan hurdle, the 6.3 billion that I was quoting earlier, then we definitely expect strong organic growth. That wouldn't be that far away, actually, from the 1% target.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just a question for you, if I could follow up on Bonnie's question right there about volume, I wonder, again, given the strength that you're seeing in your business, but broadly across the world and improving economies, Indonesia [ph], how do you see the overall tobacco market, from a volume standpoint, growing this year? Is it also down a little bit still this year? Or you've seen a better performance there overall?","Hermann G. Waldemer","The closing number is hard to predict, but I would say there are really many places in the world where relatively speaking, if you take the last 3 years' horizon, that our situation is actually improving. So what I mentioned earlier, really on more moderate decline in the mature markets and stronger growth in the emerging markets, there I can see it. At the same time, there are a number of markets where the potential or the actual up-trading has come back, that would be Russia. Russia is not going to be a growing market. I would expect again, say, about 2% decline this year, just like the 2 years before. But here, you have the up-trading element in there. So the combination of all those factors provides the basis for a continued growing and successful business for us.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. I want to ask you about 2 markets, the first one being Japan, just a quick question there. Do you expect that -- I think this comment was made on last quarter's call, that your constant currency profit would grow in Japan this year. Would that be a reasonable assumption?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, this is certainly what we are targeting and this should be about in that range, yes.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, I just wanted to confirm that. And then just the second question, as it relates to Russia, you, obviously, had a good performance in Parliament, a little softer market share performance for Marlboro, and a lot of your growth came in the lower end with Bond Street and Next. Is that -- are you still -- are you seeing a trade-down effect? Obviously, you had one premium brand doing well and one -- and some lower-end brands doing well. But I just want to get a better sense of that market and then kind of how the consumers fare in there. And there is a trade-down factor in Russia is what I'm getting at there.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, the really declining volume -- segment is the low-price filter and non-filter segment. So there is up-trading in the market overall. Then don't forget that there was another price increase in the market. So if you like, people had to up-trade in any case because prices were going up. Then if you look through the portfolio, actually, Parliament, our above-premium brand, is growing tremendously, a record market share of 3.2%. That's really excellent. Yes, Marlboro in the quarter is still down 0.2% to a 2% share. Marlboro is on a low basis in Russia, as we all know. Well, that you also have to see in the context that we actually increased the price for Marlboro by RUB 5 to RUB 60, a price positioning measure we took there, which is just part of our overall efforts in that market. marketing sales price positioning product. Everything goes together how we want to bring back Marlboro in the growth track in the market. So don't pay too much importance to the 0.2% in the month. We are working on the equity of Marlboro and that, obviously, doesn't show from one quarter to the next. That's a longer-term investment, which we are willing to go.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rogerio Fujimori of Credit Suisse.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just one quick question about trading inventory movements. So you refer to a few movements in -- unfavorable in Russia, favorable in Ukraine. So I was just wondering if there's anything else we should bear in mind when we think about Q2.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, in terms of trade inventory movements or in, if you like, what I called undemanding comparisons in the first quarter, that would, of course, be Japan. That would be Mexico at the other end of the world. But otherwise, nothing in that sense unusual. There will always be trade inventory movements from one quarter to the next. That's pretty obvious, but nothing spectacular that I could see there.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Leinster of UBS.","Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions. First of all, I think on the EU side, you mentioned quite rapid declines in Portugal and Greece in volume terms. Is that something you can quantify? Are those seriously declining markets or not that important?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, for the individual market, Greece is of course -- the decline and the deterioration that we have seen in that market, it is important. If you apply then on the PMI scale in terms of comparisons, then of course, quarter-on-quarter there, last year to this year, Greece is not important. I mean, it's simply the situation in a Greece or in a Spain in our market reflects the very serious underlying problems of those 2 economies.","Rogerio Fujimori - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I mean, in rough terms, in terms of Portugal and Greece, what have they knocked off in terms of volumes?","Hermann G. Waldemer","The total market size is -- in Greece in the first quarter, now you test my memory. It must be not too much. So Greece, about 1.2 billion. It's in the range of 20% to 25% down in Greece. I mean, it really reflects what you see in the economy there, which is why I cautioned earlier on Spain, if you just look at the market this quarter, that would be misleading. It's just comparing to a first quarter of 2011 where retail -- where tobacco leaves have really bought down their inventories dramatically and where you had the first quarter where the full-fledged public smoking ban also came into effect. So Q1 Spain this year compares to a very weak Q1 Spain last year, which is why I said, I expect another at least 10% decline in Spain for the full year. And the 10% decline expectation is probably realistic for Portugal as well.","Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Secondly, on the -- I mean, clearly, the volume growth in Indonesia is, well, almost unprecedented. But I mean, is there no comeback from the government in terms of rapid tax increases? Is there no sort of health -- sort of debate in Indonesia as to whether or not taxes should rise significant to offset the volumes?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, excise taxes have gone up also in Indonesia in the range of 7% to 8%, which compares to an inflation expectation of 5%. It's not that there are no excise increases in this part of the world. There are. It's just the overall economy. The environment is simply a growth environment, a strong growth environment. And it's kind of at the other extreme of the scale. When we were just talking Spain -- well, when we talk Indonesia, we talk about everything on the other side there.","Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Lastly, in Korea, obviously, you put the prices up in February and the impact seems to be a 5% drop in market shares. Are you surprised by the speed of reaction of the consumer in Korea and the sort of your loss of the market share quite so quickly? And do you know if that's gone to other premium brands? Or has that caused the market to trade down? Have they switched to cheap brands?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No. Essentially, I mean, the beneficiary in terms of share was, of course, the company that has not raised the prices. The only company that has not raised prices, KT&G. That was combined by a fairly bizarre consumer campaign on their side, highlighting the difference between the foreigners and the Koreans, and that was the impact. But that stuff, at the end of the day, is an impact. At the moment, we are back now to a more normal situation going forward. And the underlying trend that the Korean consumer prefers international products over Korean products, that has not changed because of those events.","Jonathan Leinster - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Right, so I say, so the market's basically just traded down on the back of that?","Hermann G. Waldemer","It really is.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jon Fell of Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Fell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First of all, on Latin America, slightly subdued underlying EBIT growth of 4%, considering revenues were up 5%. I'm just wondering if you could talk us through that a bit. I think the statement referred to organization -- or reorganization in Venezuela and Colombia, is that a short-term thing? Or is that going to have an impact later in the year? And then secondly, could you just update us on where we are with the various challenges to plain packaging in Australia in particular? I'm wondering when we might get a result from the hearing that's just closed.","Hermann G. Waldemer","So Latin America first. Well, yes, we have -- we are in the process of closing the costly plant that we have in Venezuela. That's correct. Then some organizational adjustments and stuff that we had also in Columbia -- salary impact there. And we are in the process of discussing our plans in Mexico with the employees' representatives. So that's really what's going on there. On the cost side, this is ongoing management of our business. This is nothing an underlying cost increase that will be there now or forever. Moving over to the plain packaging situation, yes, the hearings in Australia in front of the High Court have been finalized to date. The court has reserved the matter for judgment. So I would expect a decision from the High Court in Australia in the first quarter. But as you rightly say, this is not the only legal avenue. There are 3 legal avenues and 3 proceedings out there, the second one being the claim that Philip Morris has under that bilateral investment treaty between Hong Kong and Australia. There, the situation is that the first 2 judges on that panel have been selected, i.e., the judge that we select and the one that the government selects. Now those 2 judges are in the process to select the third arbitrator and judge for the panel. We expect that to happen sometime now in April or in May. So I would expect the first procedural hearings in that case in June. But as we always said, don't expect rapid judgment. This is a process that's going to take from there at least another 2 years. The third avenue is a legal proceeding between governments, i.e., the proceedings under WTO. So the first 2 countries that have started proceedings under those rules are Honduras and the Ukraine. I would -- we would expect actually more countries later in the process to join that effort. Again, however, a process that is not going to last just a couple of months. These are longer processes, but promising legal avenues.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara of Bank of America.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, Hermann, it looks like in this quarter, I guess the mix impact to revenue was negative, not to margin but to revenue, was negative for the first time in a little while. And you're talking a lot about trade up. I guess, can you talk about what would have driven that mix impact to the top line, just so I could understand it more clearly? And I guess the difference between to the top line impact versus the margin impact because obviously, one is a profitability thing and one is a price per pack thing. But can you just talk about the interplay between those 2?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, there must be a misunderstanding, quite frankly. Because in the quarter, our pricing variance is $369 million and the volume mix impact is a positive $224 million, actually adding up to $593 million, almost $600 million, i.e., an increase of more than $300 million versus first quarter of 2011.","Christopher Ferrara - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Right, and I guess that's the volume mix? I guess, I'm just talking about the overall -- the mix impact, the revenue mix impact. I guess I'll take that one offline. It might be my misunderstanding. And then I guess another one on the rate of profitability increase in Asia, the margins, they jumped pretty nicely in a quarter where average pricing has been going up in that market. This quarter wasn't a particularly large increase in pricing in Asia relative to others. Could you just give a little more clarity on why the margins jumped so nicely in Asia this quarter?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, this is -- of course, this is a number of markets. This is many markets. This is Indonesia we talked about before. This is Korea. These are price changes in many markets. It's just, I mean, on a quarter-to-quarter, sometimes, they can be just timing, which quarter comes first. But there is nothing really unusual. We don't -- we take the pricing as we deem appropriate, but no, there's no specific trend out there that I could see.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erik Bloomquist of Berenberg Bank.","Erik A. Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank, Research Division","Just one question on Turkey. It looks like the markets were -- you reported quite robust in the overall market, up 3%. I wonder if we can expect those to continue to recover. And particularly, given what you're suggesting with tax structure reform, does that bode well not only for the market, but then I would think particularly for Philip Morris?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I would say it bodes well also for the Turkish government. Such change is clearly in the interest of the government. Overall, I mean, Turkey, as a country, has a good economic outlook. Turkey has shown us often in the past that, yes, it's volatile, it's often steeper on the way down, but it's also definitely steeper on the way up. I think that's what we'll see again. We'll see a situation there of a GDP growth expectation of 4%. So things are going pretty well. And coming -- when it comes to us, well, we have a superb portfolio. This is Parliament. This is Marlboro. This is Muratti. This is Lark. This is L&M. This is Bond Street. We cover the entire range. And that's really, I would say, the secret behind our success in that market that we welcome a change in the excise structure. Of course, we do, and as you know, we have been working with the government on that. And now, as I said earlier, so the government has declared their intention to provide changes whilst the nature and the extent of the change, the timing of the changes is still open. Take it altogether, certainly positive dynamics for the Turkish market.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ann Gurkin of Davenport.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to return to the discussion about pricing and pricing you realized in the first quarter and what we know about potential excise taxes in different markets. Is there any change to expected contribution from pricing for the year in your numbers?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No. I mean, our plans for the year have remained the same. Obviously, I will not divulge what our plans are going forward. But look back to the last 3 years, 4 years, and you can see that pricing has been a constant factor and has been an important factor in our growth over those years and continues to be, and honestly, always will continue to be.","Ann H. Gurkin - Davenport & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then if I could also ask you about the U.K.'s review of standardized packaging, any comments you can make on that?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Yes, well, the U.K. has actually announced at the beginning of this week that they'll start a consultation period lasting 12 weeks. As you know, they have done the very same thing 2.5 years ago. The government has clearly stated that they want to listen to the public views, that they want to consider the legal implication, that they want to consider potential cost to retailer and the impact on demand for smuggled and counterfeit cigarettes. We will participate, of course, in that consultation. We will show that there is no credible evidence that plain packaging will reduce smoking rates, and that on the contrary, that plain packaging has serious adverse consequences, including an increase in black market for counterfeit and smuggled cigarettes. And those markets are run by criminals. So on the basis of the same facts, then 2.5, 3 years ago, I would hope and expect that the government comes to the same conclusion.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lavery of CLSA.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Marlboro brand and specifically, how you think about it globally versus in any one given country. It's certainly got some struggles in Russia. How critical is it to turn it around there? And if your portfolio is growing in total, does Marlboro need to be a bigger piece of that for you to consider that a successful market for you?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, Marlboro is tremendously successful in many, many places around the world, and it has been growing also in this quarter it's volume quite a bit. That being said, well, the world is never really perfect and we are always open as well about disclosing that we are not happy with the situation of Marlboro. Russia would be the one place. We are just too competitive and ambitious people to accept that Marlboro will stay on a 2% share in the big Russian market. Marlboro can do more and this is why we put the resources behind, the creativity behind. This is about marketing. This is about sales. This is about retail. This is about products also and product innovation for the Russian market. So we are investing because we want to improve the situation. Another markets where the situation on Marlboro has been difficult over the years is the German market, where Marlboro, essentially today, is the only premium brand left because everybody else has repositioned to the low end of the market. However, that being said, low in Germany means $0.50, $0.60 below the premium pricing. This is, therefore, not a price problem. It's an equity problem. And here again, in Marlboro -- for Marlboro in Germany, we have there worked on the campaign, the new \"Be Marlboro, Don't Be A Maybe\" campaign, which is showing strong signs of really -- of success there and is improving quite a bit the smoker share amongst the 18- to 24-year-old. Innovation that we have brought to the brand has helped enormously. They actually stand in Q1 for 10% of the total volume of Marlboro. So you see, we are tackling it from all ends, but it is important to remember that whilst there are places here and there that our performance can be improved and we are working to improve it, if you put it on a global scale, then Marlboro is doing very, very well. And it's doing extremely well in the most important Asian markets.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then just going back to one comment you made on Korea. Obviously, there's a consumer sort of transition period to get used to the new prices, but you had said something about how it seems like it's already back to normal. Have you already seen some share come back? Or did you just mean that the competitive dynamics have sort of reset wherein that can continue from here?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No. I think the share losses have occurred, come back, not yet. I was just saying that at the end of the day, the competition in Korea will be amongst brands, and we certainly have the stronger brands in this market compared to a local competitor there.","Michael Lavery - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then lastly just on tax, it looks like the rate was a little bit higher this quarter than it's been running. Is that something that will wiggle back down a little bit? Or do you think this year's rate may just be higher in general? What kind of outlook should we expect there?","Hermann G. Waldemer","The quarterly rate is our projection for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thilo Wrede of Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I only have one quick question for you. I noticed that in your -- in the press release on the country by country discussion, you started breaking out the Philip Morris brand in many more countries. Is that a brand that is getting more attention from you? What's behind that?","Hermann G. Waldemer","No, I mean, Philip Morris as a brand has always been one of our core international brands. It is just, if you like, the brand that we have selected to address the -- our underrepresentation in the low-price international segment in Italy. So I mean, it has always been a very strong brand, for example, in Argentina. It has always been a strong and growing brand over the last 10 years, I would already say, in France. No, it's just one of our top brands, but there is nothing. There is no underlying change in the way we look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Thomas Russo of Gardner Russo and Gardner.","Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner","You mentioned that -- I have 2 quick questions. You mentioned that Egypt stumbled based on an increase in illicit trade. I'm curious about the sort of magnitude of that and where it's coming from. You've done such a good job stamping it out in other parts of the world. Where is it coming into in Egypt then? And secondly, can you update us on your sense of your capacity to reinvest? You mentioned that you're directing more money towards Indonesia and the Philippines. I'm wondering about other markets and also the new product work that you're doing. What does the uptick in prospects for regions and new products suggest that you'll be able to deploy in capital going forward versus what you once thought?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Okay. I mean, Egypt has just a really -- a recent surge in illicit trade. There wasn't too much in the market before. The estimate, but there's a pure estimate. Now I said it probably has already reached about 20% of consumers [ph] in Egypt growing. It is actually eating primarily into the international brands, not really in Cleopatra, which is the low-price Egyptian brand. Well, quite frankly, that's a question of enforcement and capability to enforce their -- this is a difficult situation these days in Egypt. Then in terms of capacity to invest, is there your question really on the CapEx side?","Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner","Yes, absolutely. Yes.","Hermann G. Waldemer","Of the CapEx side, okay.","Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner","Putting out long-term capital behind the rising prospects of geographies for you and also the possible prospects for new product launches and the acceptance thereof?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I mean, in terms of really -- of CapEx, we have not changed really our multi-year average that CapEx should be in the 1:1 ratio in relation to depreciation and amortization. From 1 year to the next there can be above and then a little bit below. The average will be there. I mean, in terms of big categories where we invest, that would be super high-speed machinery. There is machinery today that can produce 20,000 cigarettes a minute. Then of course, in the important Indonesian market, that would be the capacity increase that we have there. Then we are in the process of finalizing the greenfield factory in Korea. We are investing in Korea. So the secondary is up and running. Primarily will be running in July, August of this year. In the Philippines, we do the factory upgrades following the business combination there. So it's ongoing. In terms of other investment for innovative products, as you know very well, the margin dynamics of this industry, if you really have a seller, the investment on CapEx is amortized pretty quickly.","Thomas Adrian Russo - Gardner Russo & Gardner","Yes. Last thing, Hermann, can you share with us in this low-rate environment what have been your best terms? Or is it common about an extraordinary low rate pay for some meaningful amount of borrowings? What is the high watermark issuance at the moment?","Hermann G. Waldemer","I mean, yes, you're right, I mean, in March, we actually issued $1.25 billion of bonds, $550 million with a 5-year tenure at 1.625%. And we actually issued also a 30-year bond for $700 million at 4.5%. So as you can see, again, we think also long-term and not just short-term benefit, i.e., we have increased the time, the duration of our outstanding debt. In terms of total cost of debt, the year-to-date number would be 4.2%. It has been 5% in the year 2010. It has been 4.4% in the year 2011, i.e., it keeps on coming down.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just have a very quick question around your short-term borrowing balance. It looked like it spiked up pretty significantly in the quarter despite some of the longer term issuance that you did. Could you just speak to sort of what the moving pieces were there?","Hermann G. Waldemer","Well, I mean, essentially, as you said, this is short term. We are able to borrow at extremely favorable rates on the commercial paper market. That was actually a $3.7 billion at 20 basis point average by the way, 20 basis point average at month's end. This fluctuates. So the year-to-date average would be already $1 billion less, would be $2.7 billion. But last year's average was -- the full year average was $1.9 billion. So you will always have fluctuations there. But in terms of overall financing, really, the basic principles and the cornerstones around it have not changed, the most important being that we want to be comfortably in the middle of a single A credit rating.","Operator","And that was our final question. Sir, do have any closing remarks?","Nicholas Rolli","Okay, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today on the call.

Please go ahead, sir.","Nicholas Rolli","Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2014 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we\u2019ll be talking about results for the third quarter of 2014 and comparing them to the same period in 2013 unless otherwise stated. A glossary of terms, dated tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency and acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today\u2019s webcast slides, which are posted on our website.","Please note that reduced risk products, or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce individual risk and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. Our volume and financial results in the current quarter came in slightly above our expectations. Our organic cigarette volume decreased by just 0.4% due to an improvement in industry volume trends and higher PMI market shares in the EU and EEMA regions which nearly offset relatively modest volume declines in the Asia and Latin America and Canada regions.","Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 4% while adjusted OCI was up by 4.3% on the same basis. This growth was driven by the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions, thanks in large part to higher pricing, most notably in Russia. It was partly offset by previously announced investments behind our brand and iQOS. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 10.4% to $1.59, driven primarily by continued strong profit growth across the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. ","For the first nine months of the year, we achieved growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of 11.9%. Let me remind you, however, that we will face a much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Ex-currency adjusted diluted EPS grew by 19.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and the pattern of our expenses this year is weighted much more heavily to the remainder of the year. In addition, we will be making significant investments in the fourth quarter behind the pilot launches of our iQOS platform and Marlboro HeatSticks in Nagoya, Japan and Milan in Italy. We will also make additional investment in the continuation of the rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0 as well as the absorption of underlying costs attributable to the optimization of our manufacturing footprint. ","As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are revising our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance to a range of $4.76 to $4.81 compared with $5.26 in 2013, due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate movement. Since July, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the value of certain key currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in particular the Indonesian rupiah and the Russian ruble. Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates our guidance now includes a full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.72 per share versus $0.61 in our previous guidance.","In addition, there was one additional cent in the third quarter in after-tax asset impairment and exit cost related to the termination of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands, and it is anticipated that there will be a further one cent in the fourth quarter related to the closure of our factory in Australia.","Our underlying business performance is slightly better that our previous expectations. While consumer downtrading and heavy discounting in Australia have persisted, there has been an improvement in the EU region and Indonesia and continued strong profit momentum in the EEMA and Latin American and Canada regions. Excluding the impact of currency and after-tax impairment and exit costs totaling $0.27 related to previously disclosed footprint optimization initiatives, our adjusted diluted EPS are projected to increase by approximately 6.5 to 7.5% compared to the $5.40 achieved in 2013. Our revised guidance results in a narrowing of the growth range around its midpoint.","I will now discuss the recent developments in key regions and markets, starting with the EU region. The third quarter confirmed the improving cigarette industry volume trend with a decline of 3.4%, thereby bringing the year-to-date September decline rate also to 3.4%. This represents a significant moderation compared to the 7.9% decline in the same period last year. (Indiscernible) improvement to a slight decline in illicit rate, a slowdown in the growth of e-vapor products in several markets, and (indiscernible) switching to fine-cut product. The improved trend in cigarette industry volume is visible across all six of the largest EU region markets by volume, with a particularly strong improvement in the worst affected market in southern Europe. While we do expect to see some acceleration in the decline in the fourth quarter due to recent price increases, notably in Germany, and the impact of the more challenging industry volume comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2013, we are now forecasting a full-year decline of approximately 4%.","Our market share performance in the EU region continues to be very strong with growth of 1.2 points in the third quarter to 39.7% and 1 point year-to-date September to 39.8%. The growth has been broadly based with share gains this year in all six of the largest EU region markets by volume. Our share growth reflects the strength of our key international brands, Marlboro, L&M, and Chesterfield. These brands now represent the top 3 industry brands in the region. ","In the third quarter, Marlboro gained 0.2 share points to reach 19.1%, the growth momentum being reinforced by the successful rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0. L&M\u2019s share was stable at 7% with a notable performance in Germany. Chesterfield continued its particularly strong performance, gaining 1.4 share points to reach a regional share of 5.8%. The share growth was driven by Italy, where it was price repositioned in February of this year, as well as by successful line extensions in Poland. The combination of more modest cigarette industry volume declines and share gains has resulted in an improved PMI volume performance. Were it not for the issues related to the excise tax structure in Italy, this would have translated into ex-currency adjusted OCI growth in the EU region year-to-date September. In addition, our profits are being impacted by costs related to the ending of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands and to the build-up of our commercial infrastructure in the U.K. We are cautiously optimistic that as of 2015, the EU region should contribute to PMI\u2019s profit growth, provided that improved cigarette industry volume trends continue.","I will now discuss some of our key markets in the Asia region, beginning with Japan. Year-to-date September, industry volume in Japan declined by 3.2%, which is in line with our forecast decline range of 3 to 3.5% for the full year. The third quarter provided further evidence of our success in stabilizing our market share. Excluding the impact of trade inventory movements, our market share has remained around 25.9% since the fourth quarter of 2013. The share stabilization has been driven primarily by Lark, which is performing well following the successful morphing of the Philip Morris brand in April, as well as the recent revamp of the Lark brand family. Our share has also benefited from the rollout of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign and the August launch of Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth-tasting, regular to menthol capsule product which achieved 0.6% market share in September. Going forward, we believe that our pipeline of new innovative products should further reinforce our competitive position in Japan. ","In the Philippines, third quarter tax paid cigarette industry volume was down by 3.2%; however, as Mighty Corporation continues to significantly under-declare its sales volume for excise tax purposes, the trends in the tax paid market remain distorted. We estimate that Mighty is paying excise taxes on less than half of its total sales. Market research (indiscernible) smoking incidents and at daily consumption showed continued resilience. The Bureau of Internal Revenue issued its expected regulation on tax stamps. This requires manufacturers to affix tax stamps on all locally manufactured packs of cigarettes; however, there are still significant technical issues with the production of the stamps, resulting in a delay in implementation. ","In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume trends are subject to quarterly fluctuations. This was evident in the third quarter when industry volume increased by an unexpectedly vigorous 4.9%, driven by growth in the machine-made kretek segment. On a 12-month moving basis, industry volume is up by 2.8%, and for the full year we expect industry volume to grow by around 2%. ","While our market share remained below the previous year\u2019s level, we continued to achieve positive sequential share momentum with 35.5% in the third quarter following shares of 34.6 and 34.9% in the first and second quarters respectively. This growth has been driven by our strong performance in the growing lighter tasting, machine-made kretek segment behind Sampoerna A, U Mild, and Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue. We have also seen a recent stabilization in the share of our key hand-rolled kretek brand, Dji Sam Soe, as competitive brands have crossed critical price points.","Let me now turn to Russia where our business performance continues to be strong. In (indiscernible), we reached a market share of 27.4% and on a year-to-date August basis our share increased by 0.9 points to 27%. The strong performance was driven by (indiscernible) and Parliament, mid price L&M, and low price Bond Street and Next. 2014 has been characterized by significant retail price increases driven in large part by the sizeable excise tax increase that took place at the beginning of the year. Retail prices have increased by some 17% in the premium segment and 30% at the low end of the market. This has resulted in an estimated September year-to-date cigarette industry volume decline of 9.4%, and we expect a decline of 9 to 10% for the full year; however, we have been able to boost margins through higher prices.","On September 20, the cabinet submitted draft amendments to the tax code, including proposed excise tax rates for the period of 2015 to 2017. This proposal was submitted to the Duma for further consideration and approval. The amendments are essentially in line with previous legislation and do not include features that we consider to be particularly disruptive. Should the amendment be signed into law by the president, as foreseen this November, the new excise tax rates would take effect on January 1, 2015.","While cigarette industry volume has declined significantly this year in Russia, it has remained essentially stable in the rest of the EEMA region. This stability is attributable to Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. Our business is performing well. We grew our year-to-date September regional market share by 0.1 points to 25.1%. Combined with strong pricing, this led to an increase in original adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 20.8% year-to-date September. The business outlook remains very positive thanks to the strength of Marlboro and Parliament in many key markets.","Marlboro has been one of the key drivers of our favorable global market share momentum. In the third quarter, the brand gained 0.3 share points in the Latin America and Canada region, and 0.2 share points in the EU and EEMA regions. Its share was stable overall in the Asia region. Parliament, our (indiscernible) premium proposition, has been a contributor not only to share growth but also to improved profits as its volume increased by 9.3% in the third quarter to 12.9 billion units. The brand gained share across a broad range of markets, including Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.","Pricing remained a key driver of our adjusted OCI growth during the third quarter. Our pricing variance reached $491 million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. This has been boosted by our new business structure in Egypt, partially offset by Italy. During the third quarter, we increased prices in a number of markets across the region, most notably in Argentina, Germany, Indonesia and Spain. We are on track to achieve again this year our historical average of approximately 1.8 billion in annual pricing variance.","Let me now take a moment to provide a brief update on our Reduced Risk product. As I speak, we are in the final stage of preparing for the pilot launches in Japan and Italy of our heat-not-burn iQOS product platform and Marlboro HeatSticks. These launches will be made without any reduced exposure or reduced risk claims. As already announced, the official launch of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan\u2019s fourth largest city, will take place on November 4. iQOS kits and Marlboro HeatSticks will be available at over 1,000 retail outlets in Nagoya, including the world\u2019s first iQOS flagship store located in a city center. The iQOS kit will have a recommended retail price of \u00a56,980 or approximately $65, while Marlboro HeatSticks in regular and menthol variants will retail at \u00a5460 per pack or 20, or approximately $4.29, at price parity with Marlboro cigarettes.","Our HeatSticks have been classified by the Ministry of Finance in Japan in a category that results in an effective excise tax rate that is lower than cigarettes. Our second pilot launch will take place in Milan in Italy later this year. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose any details at this time.","In September, our board approved a 6.4% increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4 per share. As a result, this year we will exceed our target dividend payout ratio of 65%, reflecting our strong confidence in our business fundamentals and future prospects. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.7%.","During the third quarter, we spent $750 million to repurchase a further 8.9 million shares at an average price of $84.54 per share. We continue to target total spending of $4 billion on share repurchases during 2014. Since the spring through the end of September this year, we have returned over $70 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","In conclusion, third quarter and year-to-date results were slightly above our expectations. As mentioned, we will face a much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. We have revised our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate movement. On a currency neutral adjusted diluted basis, we have narrowed the growth range around the midpoint to approximately 6.5 to 7.5%. While consumer downtrading and heavy discounting have unfortunately persisted in Australia, we have been able to offset this through a better performance in the EU region and Indonesia, while the EEMA and Latin America regions have continued to perform very strongly.","The iQOS pilot launches in Japan and Italy this quarter mark an important milestone for our Reduced Risk products portfolio. We are excited to bring this product to market and strongly believe that this could represent the first step in a positive paradigm shift for both PMI and the tobacco industry.","Looking ahead to 2015 and 2016, we remain confident that our business fundamentals are improving and confirm our goal of returning to currency neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI annual growth within our mid to long-term annual target rate of 4 to 6% and 6 to 8% respectively, after taking into account the anticipated investment behind the commercial expansion of our Reduced Risk product. On this basis, we target a currency neutral adjusted diluted EPS annual growth rate of 8 to 10% for this period.","Thank you. I will be now happy to answer your questions.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi Jacek. I guess I\u2019m trying to understand a few moving parts. On one hand, your total shipment volume was better than expected and you took share, but on the other hand your operating margins were down 230 basis points, so I\u2019d be curious to hear how much of the margin pressure you experienced in the quarter was from a negative mix shift in the portfolio versus the higher costs you\u2019ve been experiencing. And then could you give us a sense of how downtrading pressures have been trending so far in Q4?","Jacek Olczak","There is some mix pressure, obviously, coming mainly from Asia, from Australia, but I think it\u2019s more due to the increased investment, as previously anticipated or announced, in the second half of the year. We have increased the investment in Q3 and we will have more of the investment going into Q4 for the reasons which I mentioned in my remarks, so this is what stands behind the movement in operating margin.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and then I have a few questions on Asia, specifically Japan. Are you seeing any shift in your portfolio mix due to the tax increase, and then could you quantify for us the negative impact of inventory movements or maybe give us a sense of how much this impacted your volume and profits in the country in the quarter?","Jacek Olczak","Well, we could see a better performance of Lark partially following the successful morphing from Philip Morris into Lark, and also some marketing initiatives which we put behind the brand. Lark obviously is also slightly more\u2014you know, lower price than the premium brands in the market. I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to say what this pricing move\u2014you know, unequal pricing moves over 20 and \u00a510 have created in terms of a dynamic behind the brand, but yes, I think Lark is doing slightly better than Marlboro in this comparison.","When it comes to that adjustment which we\u2019re making in Japan, it\u2019s essentially we\u2019re trying to adjust the inventories to reflect the total market outlook and still year-on-year. I mean, our lower share, as you might notice, we stabilized our share on a sequential basis but versus last year we\u2019re still down, and these adjustments are essentially to represent (indiscernible). So I think you have\u2014just to give you a number, I think on the inventory you have about half a billion units on inventory adjustment in Q3.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then my last question is on the e-vapor slowdown in the EU that you mentioned. What are you seeing in terms of the key trends and pressures on this category, and then does this give you even more confidence in your iQOS platform?","Jacek Olczak","Well, the trends essentially are the same trends which I talked about, that we talked about at the investors\u2019 day on the second quarter. The consumers aren\u2019t moving into (indiscernible) system. I think we all know the reasons behind it \u2013 I mean, the first product launches in the e-cigarette category are not really satisfying the consumer, so the acceptance rates are falling down. That\u2019s about the trend. Most of the markets, in essentially all of the markets, we see the same, so it\u2019s just the continuation of the trend.","Now does this give us more optimism behind iQOS? I think it was more than a year or two years ago when we said that the current technology behind the e-cigarette doesn\u2019t (indiscernible) that well. We think that iQOS is by far a much better satisfying product. We have confirmed it in our tests before going to the test market. As you remember, the acceptance rate\u2014I mean, consumers who fully switched from a conventional cigarette, combustible cigarettes to iQOS proposition were really very high \u2013 they were reaching 30%. I think we were encouraged by this result and hence we\u2019re going to the test market. So I don\u2019t think this change in the trends or continuation of this negative trend in e-cigarettes gives us more confidence behind the iQOS. Frankly speaking, we have that confidence, so we are a very high level of confidence when it comes to iQOS.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo ","","And then maybe lessons learned on pricing, too, just in terms of the affordability of the e-vapor category relative to where you\u2019re pricing iQOS and the HeatSticks. You\u2019re pricing them, you mentioned, at parity I think with Marlboro, I believe you mentioned.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, this is how we positioned the product in Japan, although we are not disclosing the details for Milan, but you understand our philosophy \u2013 I mean, that has a benefit, therefore, I think that product deserves to be sold at a premium price, so this is\u2014I think we\u2019d state what we have said before, that that\u2019s the positioning based on how much effort we have put into developing this product, despite the fact that we\u2019re not claiming other benefits in Japan. But we are aware about also the science which we have put in validating the benefits of this product. I think it all comes together and makes this product deserving of being put in the premium segment, at the premium price.","Bonnie Herzog \u2013 Wells Fargo","All right, thank you, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi Jacek. So first, just maybe on FX, and obviously the currency market continues to be very volatile, and if we just assume maybe prevailing rates, just trying to gauge the impact on 2015, really, and I get to number of something like a negative $0.35 or so. So can you just confirm that that\u2019s kind of in the ballpark of where you see the impact in 2015 at current rates, especially when you take into consideration the effective hedge rates on the yen.","Jacek Olczak","I wouldn\u2019t go into 2015 at this stage. You know that our practice was we always gave this\u2014we talk about the impact of the currency at the time when we give the guidance for the year. One thing, which I\u2019m not presumably disclosing anything new, if you look what is happening in the currency market over the last 24 hours, 48 hours away, it\u2019s an extremely volatile market, so I think it\u2019s another presumably reason when it\u2019s better not to give any number or confirm any sort of range at this stage.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just on the yen though, Jacek, I think the last time you talked about the effective hedge at 98 for this year, has there been any change to that number as we think about the year-over-year impact?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, there is a bit of the impact of the yen. The effective rate will be higher than 98. In the revised guidance for the currency at the spot rate which we gave today when we revised the impact by an additional negative $0.11, yen actually just (indiscernible) contribute $0.01. I mean, most of the impact which we get, which we have in this $0.11 additional is coming from Russian ruble and the rupiah, the Indonesian rupiah. So yen just adds an additional $0.01, and very much because last portion of our cash flow to revenues from Japan is already\u2014was already hedged.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Then just in terms of what you\u2019re seeing and the Russian market, just wondering if any of the recent volatility in the currency fluctuation is having any impact in terms of demand or the pricing, the competitive dynamics in that market. Your volume in the third quarter in Russia was up 0.8%, market share obviously was up, but was there any benefit in terms of any year-over-year inventory movement that boosted your shipment number as well?","Jacek Olczak","No, actually the volume, the shipment volume I think was down by 0.4. The shipment volume was not up. Market share was up, and this partially is why our shipment volume is better than overall market performance. It\u2019s partially coming from the strong performance of our brands. The share advancements which we are realizing in Russia at the tune of the (indiscernible), so that\u2019s significant. There is obviously some timing of the shipment to our distributors, but I think overall it\u2019s the performance of both Parliament, which you know that\u2019s very positive if you take into consideration the magnitude of the pricing which we have realized in the market, but also Bond Street, so it nicely\u2014you know, I think the portfolio there is nicely complementary, and that stands behind the better share and hence the better shipment versus the total market.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And any color on the recent trends given the recent volatility in that market?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, sorry \u2013 I missed this one. Not really. I mean, you see our outlook for the full year even, taking into consideration the implemented and announced price increases in Russia, it\u2019s still that the market is going to decline in the range of 9 to 10%. If you would just calculate what is the resulting price elasticity, everyone would realize that Russia is a very normal for our category for a tobacco category elasticity range, so that (indiscernible) at this stage any headwinds coming from the currency, from inflation or other macros. Now, this is the situation as of today. We will have to obviously watch, and we do watch carefully how the situation may unfold into the next period, but as I said, I think our comfort on Russia is also coming through the well-laddered portfolio of brands, and I\u2019ll repeat myself, starting with the premium Parliament in the premium, going through the value, mid-price brands, low price brands. So I think on that one, I think we should be able to hedge any potential headwinds if they were to materialize.","Judy Hong \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you very much, Judy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, good morning. Thanks Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, and congratulations I guess, right?","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes \u2013 thank you, it\u2019s exciting. So two questions from me. First, I wanted to follow up on the price mix question, specifically for Europe. I\u2019d expected to see some sequential improvement in pricing realization within the region, given Germany, Portugal, Spain, but that didn\u2019t seem to materialize during the quarter but is more at the regional level. Market share trends were very strong \u2013 maybe that\u2019s positive, but just wondering if you\u2019re seeing incremental downtrading overall within your portfolio or shifts within Marlboro to some of the lower priced variants that are weighing on overall pricing realization.","Jacek Olczak","I mean, the pricing \u2013 yes, it was very low pricing. The variants coming from the EU this quarter, it\u2019s partially the timing when we took the price increase in Germany, and obviously there was a negative \u2013 which is in this number \u2013 coming from Italy. Just to remind, we are in the VAT absorption for the three quarters of this year, obviously, including the third quarter is going to be about behind us around the mid of the fourth quarter, and obviously there was a Chesterfield repositioning. If I would look in detail market by market in the EU region, I would see\u2014I can see the positive pricing variance coming essentially from most of the countries, with the exception, as I mentioned, of Italy, so Italy is an overall drag, if you like, on the pricing variance in the region.","Obviously downtrading \u2013 I think again I would have to go to Italy. I mean, Chesterfield, which is now\u2014you know, recorded market share well above 10%, there is a bit of a decline of Marlboro to the tune of about a point. So yes, there is some downtrading, but this is also the reason why we have lowered the beginning of the price of Chesterfield in order to stop total market share erosion on our side.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","And the brand responded very well, so I think that part of the exercise went very well.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. So really, the only thing that would change much sequentially in the fourth quarter would be the headwind from Italy becoming less severe.","Jacek Olczak","On the pricing variance, yes.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","On the pricing variance, because on the OCI, as I mentioned in my remarks, one of the tests markets which we\u2019ll be conducting is in Italy, is in the European Union, and the second EU was on the forefront and is on the forefront of the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 architecture; hence, in our remarks I think I made this comment that despite the fact that the volumes and our shipment volume is performing very strongly and is great for this year and even greater for 2015, however this year our profitability will be impacted as we cannot convert it into the profitability growth due to Marlboro 2.0, iQOS and some underlying costs due to shutting down the cigarette manufacturing at our factory in Holland.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Secondly just on currency, specifically on hedging, given the persistence and the magnitude of the currency headwind, have you considered at all changing the internal philosophy toward how you manage FX risk, perhaps including more active hedging or, if not that, maybe encouraging local country managers to more actively offset transactional FX through pricing or discretionary reductions in operating costs?","Jacek Olczak","This would require a significant change to the risk profile, if you like, which we\u2019d like to have. I mean, as is presumably known to the community, most of the impact of the currency on our results comes from the translation, and the range of 70 to 80% of the impact which we have on our translation is not on the transactions. So our philosophy obviously has an impact on our reported results, but I don\u2019t think we should be moving closer to something which would add an element of speculation into\u2014volatility into our performance.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. Then just to confirm, historically we\u2019ve thought of your hedging practices as isolated within sort of euro-yen and perhaps dollar-yen. Are there any others that you are actively hedging, just when we\u2019re thinking about the disconnects between our currency model and\u2014","Jacek Olczak","There are some hedges which we\u2019re doing on the\u2014associated with the leaf purchases in Turkey, but most of the hedges are around the yen and the balance sheet hedges on our positions on the euro.","Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. All right, thank you again, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Hi Chris.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","I just had a question for you to start off on\u2014just to understand the third quarter and maybe the fourth quarter, the phasing of costs that may be coming through. If I could just list what I was\u2014when I\u2019ve been watching this, obviously the Marlboro 2.0, obviously there are some costs related to that \u2013 I think that cuts across all regions \u2013 obviously the closure of Bergen op Zoom, maybe a little bit of Australia. And then I guess also related to that, the Reduced Risk products, is that heavier fourth quarter spending versus the third quarter, and do you have any color you can add around the phasing and maybe in general how much those costs are a burden in profit right now?","Jacek Olczak","Certainly, Chris, I will give you color; but I would start with the 2013 fourth quarter, because if you would look at our performance in 2013, you\u2019ll realize that our phasing of the costs in the last year was much more skewed towards the first half of the year, or the first three quarters of the year. So adjusting apples to apples, I had $200 million positive cost variance in Q4 of 2013, so that\u2019s my starting position going into Q4 of this year. It is now combined that the pattern of our spending on initiatives is much more skewed towards the second half, and in particular to the Q4 of this year, and that actually creates the swing on the cost Q4 on Q4 going in the range of 400, maybe 400-plus even in this comparison. (Indiscernible).","Now, drivers of this additional\u2014of this investment in the second half or in the Q4 of this year is, as I mentioned in the case of the EU before, is iQOS launch in Milan. There was some preparation cost already falling into Q3, but most of that will hit my Q4 results. Marlboro 2.0 would be the remainder part of the markets in the EU which would roll out the Marlboro new architecture in the Q4, and there was this underlying cost associated or related to the closure of the factory. ","To give you magnitude, the underlying costs which we carried this year due to the restructuring both in Holland and in Australia is in the range of about\u2014will hit my Q4 results in a range of about $40 million. So you start adding these numbers, you will see why we\u2019re saying that the Q4 results\u2014I mean, it will not be as great as Q3 or Q2 this year, and this is reflected in our guidance.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Sure. That was actually very good color. Thank you for all that detail. If I could ask a second question \u2013 in relation to your guidance for the year, which you\u2019ve now kind of narrowed the guidance range for EPS, do you have the same assumption for Australia built into that guidance? Has that gotten any better or any worse than what you thought, even back from sort of the investor day back in June?","Jacek Olczak","No, it didn\u2019t get any worse or didn\u2019t get any better. As I said, unfortunately the heavy discounting and the competition in the low part of the market, as it intensified at the beginning of the year, it continues to be pertinent, and I think it\u2019s maybe also to be more on a positive side, one of the competitors made an assumption that you can have volume growth in that market by being very aggressive on the price. You will not break the strategy until you switch off the volume growth of a given brand, so I think what we\u2019re doing, part of our strategy despite the fact that it is obviously costly financially, I think it actually may lead to bringing some logic to the behavior in the market.","So this is all in our guidance. I think versus the Q2, especially at the investors\u2019 day, which I think prudence at that time had dictated that we had to recognize that there was this potential headwind coming from Australia, I think at that time we were waiting for more confirmation of positive trends coming from other geographies, which were nicely materializing in Q3. But as I said, I think it would be imprudent to bet on this development in Q2, and now we\u2019re in a very comfortable position to say that this lower end of the range, of the guidance which we gave at that time, is no longer something which we should be worried about, and we can comfortably deliver in the midpoint of that range. The drivers, I think, are well known \u2013 EU had a spectacularly good improvement on the total market, and our market share continues to do very well. Indonesia is a very positive surprise \u2013 it\u2019s coming. We knew that the market might be stronger, but I think last quarter Q3 has confirmed that the market is going in the right direction. Also, the growth momentum\u2014you saw our OCI, adjusted OCI growth in EEMA and Latin America \u2013 I mean, they\u2019re really coming very strongly.","So this is very important for us, not only from a Q3 perspective but I would say even more important for us from a 2015 and beyond perspective, that the roadmap which we have laid down for this year, we step-by-step made progress and therefore we should return to the higher level of growth in 2015 and \u201916.","Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, that was very good \u2013 thank you. I agree, so thanks so much. Speak to you soon.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of James Bushnell from Exane BNP.","James Bushnell \u2013 Exane BNP","","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first is on the tax situation in Italy. I just wondered if you could give us your latest thoughts as to what might be happening and when. I think January \u201915, we were hopeful that something might change. Then my second question is on plain packaging in Europe. When the first country passes legislation, whoever that might be, do you think you could give us a roadmap about what would happen, and would you be hopeful that a legal challenge to that could either delay or stop the implementation of plain packaging, or is it just a case of having to take a country to court and then having to do that while their going ahead with the measure? Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Okay, I\u2019ll start with Italy. The tax restructuring in Italy is following its normal legislative process. We expect the objective is that this should happen still this year, so it would be implemented as of January 1 next year. I mean, that\u2019s the objective and we\u2019ll see how it works, but as I said, the restructuring is being discussed and is following the normal Italian legislative process.","When it comes to plain packaging, the second question which you raised, there\u2019s nothing really new which has happened recently, because we were aware about Ireland, we were aware about U.K. Yes, there was a statement from the Ministry of Health in France that she would propose the legislation implementing, calling for implementation of plain packaging. To date to our knowledge, this is not a governmental position and no legislative initiatives have been made, at least to date, into this direction.","Now, litigation which you have mentioned quite rightly, it\u2019s obviously in our tool box of actions which we can take in order to protect the extremely valuable trademarks which we have. But there are also other elements which we are exploring before we reach into litigation. But yes, there is litigation which clearly is something which we will not be shy to use if this is what will be required by us.","One thing which is important to note when we talk about the U.K. and Ireland, if I am not mistaken, there are nine countries today or member states in the EU which have raised their concerns to Ireland in particular, and I think there are two countries already which have raised their concerns to the U.K. vis-\u00e0-vis they announced or the indication of introducing the plain packaging in this country. It clearly demonstrates to you, or demonstrates to us that a number of member states in the EU itself are pretty much concerned whether this is the right policy to be implemented, both from the perspective of the principles of internal market \u2013 and let\u2019s remember that the whole purpose of creating the EU and the legislative powers which were given in the form of directives, were to support the development of internal markets. Frankly speaking, plain packaging is not necessarily something which goes in this direction.","So yes, to summarize this, plain packaging is an element in our tool box and we will not be shy to use that if this is what will be required.","James Bushnell \u2013 Exane BNP","Okay, thank you very much. If I could just follow up \u2013 and sorry to bring up currency again, but I noticed that the gap between your FX effect on your sales line versus your OCI line is widening, which presumably reflects a bit more transactional hit. I just wondered if you comment, is that still mostly the yen or does the Russian ruble come in there as well?","Jacek Olczak","No, mostly in our revised guidance, the largest impact was coming from the ruble, the rupiah. The yen, as I said earlier, was $0.01. We obviously had a positive Swiss franc on the cost side, which more than offset the negative coming from the euro.","James Bushnell \u2013 Exane BNP","Sorry \u2013 I meant in terms of the transactional FX exposure that you\u2019ve seen in Q3. Is it mostly from the yen, or is there also an impact from the ruble where I believe your costs are predominantly not in rubles, whereas your revenues are?","Jacek Olczak","No, I think it was more from the ruble. I think it was more from the ruble on the transactional side.","James Bushnell \u2013 Exane BNP","Okay, great. Thank you very much for your help.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist from Berenberg. ","Erik Bloomquist \u2013 Berenberg","Hi Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, good morning.","Erik Bloomquist \u2013 Berenberg","I was hoping you could discuss in a little more detail about the tax treatment of the HeatSticks in Japan, and then perhaps in Italy as well. I was wondering if you could give us some more perspective on the tax differential, what is it driven by \u2013 it is lower rate, is it taxed by\u2014you know, what the basis for that is, and then the ability of that tax treatment to be extended into other countries in the various regions. Thanks.","Jacek Olczak","Tax treatment in Japan results that the iQOS HeatSticks will pay a tax about 20% lower than the tax on cigarettes. It\u2019s classified in a different tax category for the reasons that it is not a cigarette and this is not combustible, so there is another level to the tax category and the Ministry of Finance has decided to classify this product there. It\u2019s also very much similar to what has happened with the competitive product in that market \u2013 I mean Ploom from JT, which also is classified in this tax category.","I can\u2019t tell you more about Italy, about the tax classification, but as we have said also during investors\u2019 day, I think we have a pretty strong case that this product, for various reasons, should enjoy better taxation than the combustible, conventional cigarettes. Now, how this will materialize, we\u2019ll have to see, but this is what we, in our engagement in the various markets, took the direction which we take.","Erik Bloomquist \u2013 Berenberg","Okay. With respect to\u2014again, another foreign exchange-related question. Given that that has such a material impact on the balance sheet and the ability to buy back stock, is this really implying that in 2015, the amount of buyback available to Philip Morris will be much more at the low end of what you suggested, and does that therefore imply, given your confidence in hitting kind of an 8 to 10% constant currency EPS target, that the operational component of next year perhaps looks a bit stronger?","Jacek Olczak","We had said, I think, at the investors\u2019 day that we\u2019re looking at the range of 2 to $3 billion for next year, but obviously the final target, final amount will depend on two factors. One is obviously the acquisitions, and second is also importantly the development on the exchange rate, which obviously with our limited headroom to further leverage the balance sheet in order to support the single-A rating, that\u2019s something which we have to and we are watching very carefully. When we give the target in February, the target will reflect the development or potential developments on both sides, so I don\u2019t want to go into\u2014you know, commit to any number for next year. As I said, we will announce it in February.","Erik Bloomquist \u2013 Berenberg","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen & Company.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","In terms of South Korea and the potential for a proposed tax increase, can you speak to the likelihood of that actually passing?","Jacek Olczak","Hi Vivien. Well, I think there is a high likelihood that the tax increase will happen. What we don\u2019t know at this stage is the magnitude of that increase, if it\u2019s going to be in the range of apparently 1000, 1.5 or 2001, we\u2019ll have to see. So this is what I can tell you at this stage, and clearly it is significant, a very significant tax increase, but we also have to remember, if my memory is not wrong, that we\u2019re approaching the tenth anniversary of no tax increase in Korea. So I think we\u2019ll have to take this magnitude also from the perspective of when was the last time Korea had adjusted the tax rates.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","That\u2019s fair. Thank you. Your key competitor in that market has not always priced, I think, the way that everyone would have hoped. Is there any reason to think that they would be more constructive on pricing around the tax increase?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I wouldn\u2019t like to go into speculation.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Fair enough.","Jacek Olczak","I mean, the investment community knows that the past performance is not necessarily the best driver of the guidance for future performance, so let\u2019s stay with this. I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, fair. In terms of platform 2, can you just confirm that it remains on track and roughly one year behind platform 1?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, yes. Nothing\u2019s changed there.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","So would we expect a test in the coming six months?","Jacek Olczak","No, we should expect the test in 2015 to end of 2015.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay.","Jacek Olczak","But we say that the platform too is about one year\u2014is a year behind. As per plan, it\u2019s behind the platform 1.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","So not even a consumer test? Because in Japan and Italy, even though you\u2019re going to city test in the fourth quarter, didn\u2019t you go into do some consumer testing that you spoke about at CAGNY in February?","Jacek Olczak","Vivien, we\u2019re talking about the two levels of consumer testing. One is the consumer testing in terms of the all over test, which obviously will be done\u2014we will be doing first; and then there\u2019s the consumer testing in terms of launching into the selected city or close to geography. So always, we\u2019re going in the same\u2014we will repeat the same sequence as we have done or as we are doing so far with iQOS platform 1.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Terrific.","Jacek Olczak","So the second part of 2015.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Understood. My last question is on the FDA submission that you\u2019re working on jointly with Altria. Any progress or updates on that? Do you have a sense of when you might actually make a formal submission to the FDA on MRTP?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I think it was subject to us concluding the clinical studies and closing the entire scientific package which is to support that submission, so the clinical studies as per plan, we will be completing them in the mid of next year, second quarter next year, and then the preparation for the pack of submissions can only really start afterwards.","Vivien Azer \u2013 Cowen & Company","Very clear. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA. ","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Just turning to Indonesia, you indicated that the guidance for the category for the year would be around a 2% growth rate, which implies around a 1% decline in the quarter for 4Q. I know that the comp gets about 2 points tougher, but that\u2019s around a 6 point deceleration. Is there anything you think that\u2019s looming that would drive that, or is that just a conservative number? How are you thinking about the category dynamics there?","Jacek Olczak","I think we are looking at little bit on a longer time span, not just the quarters. As I indicated in my remarks on the 12-month moving basis, the market is in a 2.4% decline. I think the 2% sounds to us\u2014seems more realistic for the full year. Maybe it\u2019s going to come a little bit better. I have to admit that Q3 came better than we expected, so that we recognize by changing a little bit\u2014changing the outlook for the full year. The market may come better because there\u2019s not much in headwinds which I can see in the market \u2013 actually, quite opposite because as long as nothing is dramatically changing in terms of drivers of the bit lower performance last year, i.e. fuel subsidies or removal of partial fuel subsidies. I think there was spikes in food inflation. I think that these things are slowing coming behind us, so maybe the market can even do better. But let\u2019s see. I think 2% is about to be realistic, the realistic number as we see it at this stage.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. You had said that your July share was just over 35%, and you came in the full quarter at 35.5. Was that a sequential progression, so you would have finished the quarter maybe around 36%, and could you give any sense of how that\u2019s continued into 4Q or for September?","Jacek Olczak","There was sequential growth of share in Indonesia, quarter-on-quarter and also within the month. This is very much driven by the fact that Dji Sam Soe competitors, main competitors of Dji Sam Soe have crossed the critical price point of Rp12,000 per pack, and as we expect at this moment that Dji Sam Soe will compete with the brands without this obstacle, if you like, of the psychological price point. We should observe the better performance, and Dji Sam Soe is coming actually now flat on the third quarter and year-on-year, so we stabilized the brand. Obviously our entry with extending the brand into machine-made kretek, both on full flavor and lighter variants, helped a lot, so this is very good. ","So yes, we\u2019re growing sequentially there, and I think we should expect this going through the year, although I think for still on a full-year basis we will be below our market share of the last year. But I think it\u2019s a very nice starting point which we\u2019re building already now into 2015.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","And what is the mix impact from that? Obviously you\u2019ve lost the low-end brands and that would seem to be a benefit. Certainly the hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe pressure would offset some of that, but if that\u2019s stabilizing, is your mix a positive benefit now or is that still pressured?","Jacek Olczak","There is. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that much of\u2014I mean, there is some mix pressure, but you have to remember that there\u2019s a different tax level also behind the different price points and the different category of the product, so the margin differential is not necessarily fully translated. It can\u2019t be fully translated just from the retail price perspective.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, great \u2013 yeah, thank you. Then just on iQOS, you have the unit price that you mentioned. Does that have any flexibility in terms of the launch period, just for discounting or anything that\u2014you know, obviously you want to get people to try this or get it in people\u2019s hands. Certainly for a premium product, I\u2019ve seen that pricing approach, but what\u2019s the right way to think about adoption and how to make sure that\u2019s not a prohibitive cost for people to think about up front?","Jacek Olczak","By the regulatory ramifications which we have in Japan, we cannot have a discount on the HeatSticks, on the Marlboro HeatSticks.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Oh no, sorry \u2013 I didn\u2019t mean the HeatStick, I mean the iQOS unit itself.","Jacek Olczak","It is an introductory price, and the whole offering, the introductory offering to the consumer, which will be going for the iQOS heating device, tobacco heating device.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","So you do have room to put incentives on that?","Jacek Olczak","Sorry?","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","You do have flexibility to how you price that in terms of just getting it adopted initially? I think you said it\u2019s the \u00a569.80, that\u2019s the sort of list price, I guess, and you could work off of that to have an upfront discount or something?","Jacek Olczak","Absolutely correct. You\u2019re reading this like you would be in Nagoya.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, great. Thank you. Then just one last question on lower oil prices. I know certainly in Indonesia last year, we saw consumer sensitivity to inflation there. Obviously every country is different, but very broadly speaking with the big move in oil, do you feel like that\u2019s potentially a net consumer benefit enough to impact any volume outlook? Obviously it hasn\u2019t\u2014it\u2019s a recent move and it hasn\u2019t stuck for a long time necessarily, but is that potentially a positive in terms of how you just look ahead for the next three, six, nine, 12 months?","Jacek Olczak","I think it is positive. I think we all would like to have oil lower, right, at lower prices, especially Indonesia where the market, its consumers are more sensitive. Yes \u2013 I mean, that is the right direction, hence as I said earlier that it might be that the volumes in Indonesia will do a bit better than the 2% for the full year. I mean, let\u2019s see how this develops, but it\u2019s positive, you\u2019re absolutely right.","Michael Lavery \u2013 CLSA","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett from Nomura.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Just one from me. I was just wondering the pricing benefit from the change in business structure in Egypt. I was wondering if you could quantify this, and can we expect this to drop off into next year when it laps?","Jacek Olczak","Well, the benefit is coming from in the past or in the year 2013, what we\u2014the way we operated our structure in Egypt was that we\u2019d been selling just the materials, the components, i.e. tobacco (indiscernible), et cetera. The manufacturing was taking place outside Philip Morris by the partners in Egypt. As of this year, we\u2019re fully owning the entire approach, fully owning the entire process, and we recognize the full cost of manufacturing, so this is all materials plus the conversion, et cetera, but also correspondingly we recognize the full revenue, i.e. the price which we\u2019re charging to the first customer.","The impact of Egypt, of this accounting or reporting reflecting business structure, is in the range\u2014at the top line at the revenue in a range of about $200 million. This is obviously the business organic growth which we are realizing this year, which is coming on top of this. But this is how much Egypt is pushing or increasing our revenue, but you also remember you have an offset in the cost base. So when it comes to OCI, the net benefit which we\u2019re realizing due to the structure is not really inflating the numbers between the two years. But there is organic growth in Egypt.","Owen Bennett \u2013 Nomura","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","We have time for one final question today. Your last question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.","Adam Spielman \u2013 Citi","Hello, thank you for taking the question. I hope I can ask a question about 2015 and \u201916, because you mentioned this in your press release. In it, you say and reiterate that you to hope to achieve 6 to 8% OCI growth constant currency, but you also mention the costs of the expansion of Reduced Risk products. So the question is in the context of your entire OCI, is the commercial cost of the\u2014the cost of commercializing Reduced Risk products material? I assume it is, and I assume that it\u2019s going to be one or two percentage points, otherwise you wouldn\u2019t have bothered mentioning it in your press release. That\u2019s the question \u2013 thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Yes, (indiscernible). Yes, there is an increased cost of iQOS which is already included in our overall target for the next year. Obviously when we come in February, we will give the proper detailed guidance for the year, but from the very beginning we said that we\u2019re targeting 6 to 8% adjusted OCI growth ex-currency in 2015 and \u201916, and this number includes the cost, also obviously in the later part of this period, the revenue coming from iQOS. So this is all included there, and there will be quite an increase or a substantial increase of our spending behind iQOS next year, but this number is included in our target.","Adam Spielman \u2013 Citi","Okay, but just to confirm, it is a material amount that is included?","Jacek Olczak","Yes, but I will not disclose\u2014","Adam Spielman \u2013 Citi","How material \u2013 I knew you wouldn\u2019t do that, but that\u2019s clear.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of questions from the investment community.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.","Nick Rolli","Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our 2013 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com.","During our call, we will be talking about results for the third quarter 2013 and comparing them to the same period in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to volumes are for PMI shipments, industry volume and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Organic volume refers to volume excluding acquisitions. Net revenues exclude excise taxes.","Operating companies\u2019 income or OCI is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and the amortization of intangibles. You will find data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI for currency, acquisitions, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures at the end of this presentation, which is also posted on our website.","Today\u2019s remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today\u2019s presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.","It\u2019s now my pleasure to introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer. Jacek?","Jacek Olczak","Thank you, Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen. As anticipated, we achieved improved financial results in the third quarter compared to the first half of the year, despite the persistent severe macro-economic challenges and their extraordinary impact on industry volume, adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, increased by 10.9% in the quarter.","A key driver of our performance has been the strength of our brand portfolio, despite its strong premium skew in a weak economy. We have strong market share momentum in the majority of our main markets with the key exception of Japan and the Philippines, where the issues are known.","In the quarter, our market share increased in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions, while the international share of Marlboro, excluding China and the Philippines increased to 9.3%.","Our quarterly share in Asia was impacted by the timing of our shipments in Pakistan, as well as the share losses in the Philippines. On a year-to-date September basis, our international share, excluding China and the Philippines is stable at 26.7%.","The second key driver has been pricing. During the third quarter, we achieved a pricing variance of $488 million, bringing our total pricing variance for 2013 to over $1.5 billion. This compares favorably to the $1.3 billion achieved during the same period in 2012 and significantly more than offset the $900 million in unfavorable volume mix.","In addition to the substantial amount of pricing taken at the beginning of the year we have increased prices in a number of markets since May. These include Argentina, Australia, France, Germany, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Russia, Spain and Ukraine.","Strong pricing coupled with the timing of certain cost items enabled us to increase our adjusted OCI margin ex-currency between the first half and the third quarter of this year from 45.2% to 47.5% behind a strong expansion in the EU, EEMA and Latin America and Canada region.","We anticipate a strong fourth quarter. The adjustment to our reported diluted 2013 earnings per share guidance today reflects the impact of changes in exchange rate and estimated fourth quarter charge for restructuring and the cautious outlook regarding certain markets. ","In July, we forecast a reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 of $5.43 to $5.53. Today\u2019s guidance includes an additional $0.02 in unfavorable currency at prevailing exchange rates for a total of $0.33 per share for the full year. This also includes approximately $0.03 per share for a fourth quarter charge related to the restructuring program that we announced at the end of last month and the $0.01 charge related to the American Tax Payer Relief Act of 2012, which we reported in the first quarter of 2013.","Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2013 is now $5.35 to $5.40. Excluding currency and the aforementioned charges, this represents a growth rate of approximately 10% compared to our adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22 in 2012. ","Let me now review a number of our key geographies starting with the EU region. While unemployment continued to rise throughout 2012 in the 28 EU member states, it has remained stable this year at an average rate of 10.9%. However, unemployment has continued to increase notably in France and Italy. Despite a continued weak macroeconomic environment, the rate of decline in cigarette industry volume has gradually moderated throughout the year.","After a decline of 10.6% and 8% respectively in the first and second quarters, cigarette industry volume in the EU region declined by 5.4% in the third quarter, helped by the reduction in the excise tax differential between the cigarette and fine cut in several Southern European countries and stabilization in the prevalence of illicit trade albeit at a high level. ","For the full year, we are still expecting total cigarette industry volume to be down between 7% and 8% while fine cut industry volume should be up slightly. Going forward, we expect market declines to remain above historical level until European government successfully tackled the issue of unemployment and the illicit trade and consumer sentiment and purchasing power improved.","Our business fundamentals remained strong across the EU region. We have gained share so far this year in all of the six largest cigarette markets in the region, namely France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the U.K. In addition, we have successfully leveraged our cigarette brand in the fine cut category, gaining one share point year to date September on a regional basis to reach 14.4%. While our OCI, excluding currency remained below last year level through September, it increased by 5.4% in the third quarter and we expect an improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter.","Our four key brands Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris continued to perform well. They all gained cigarette market share in the EU region in the third quarter. During the quarter, the share of Marlboro was higher notably in Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain; a remarkable result in view of the economy while L&M was the fastest growing brand in the region as a whole in terms of market share. ","I will complete my overview of the EU region with an update on the status of the Tobacco Product Directive. The European parliament debated the proposal last week and accepted several amendments. The parliament notably agrees to a 65% health warning rather than the proposed 75%; that flavored cigarettes, including menthol variants, should be prohibited after a transition period of five years following the transposition of the TPD; that slim cigarettes should continue to be allowed and that e-cigarettes would not be treated as medical devices but rather be more strictly regulated under the TPD with higher nicotine thresholds than originally foreseen.","We welcome these marginal improvements but regret that the European Parliament voted to ban an entire segment of the legal market, despite the inevitable increase in illicit trade that this will fuel. They have failed to provide a comprehensive framework for reduced harm products and have continued to include oversized health warnings without any apparent concern for property rights that the EU Charter protects and restrictions on pack formats.","Finally, the proposal still contains an unworkable and discriminatory anti-illicit trade solution, which adds complexity to the legitimate supply chain without addressing the core problem.","The next step is for the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to reach a final consensus. While the timing remains uncertain, the TPD is expected to be adopted before the end of this year or during the first quarter of 2014.","There will then be a period of 18 to 24 months for the Directive to be transposed into national legislation at the Member State level, so that it may become effective across the EU by the end of 2015.","Let me now turn to the two key EEMA markets, starting with Russia. We implemented an additional price increase of 4 rubles per pack during the June-July period on most of our brands, thus enhancing unit margins.","Due to the higher prices, a deteriorating economic environment and the implementation in June of workplace smoking restrictions, there was an acceleration in the rate of cigarette industry volume decline in the third quarter to an estimated 9%, mainly impacting the super-low segment. For the full-year, we expect industry volume to be down by about 7% to 8%.","Our market share performance continues to be resilient, in spite of competitors again lagging our price increases this year. Our August year-to-date market share was 26.1%, down by 0.1 share point, with Parliament in particular performing very well in the above premium price segment.","Despite the lower volume, our strong pricing enabled us to increase our profitability ex-currency at a double-digit rate in the third quarter. In September, the Russian Duma approved the excise tax rates on cigarettes for the period 2014 through 2016. In line with expectations, the ad-valorem rate will increase from 8.0% to 8.5% next January, while the specific excise tax will increase from 550 to 800 rubles per thousand cigarettes.","The pass-on for Marlboro would be around eight rubles per pack or approximately 11%. The increase in the specific excise tax is 45% in 2014, while the increases in 2015 and 2016 are slated to be 20% to 25%.","In Turkey, cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 5% in the third quarter. Illicit trade declined only marginally from the second quarter. For the full year, we are forecasting an industry volume decline of around 7% to 8%.","Our business fundamentals remain strong with sequential volume improvements. Our market share was up by 0.1 point in the quarter through August to 46.1%, with further gains from premium Parliament and at mid-price Muratti. Both Lark and L&M suffered some share erosion at the 6.50 Lira per pack price, due to the rapid emergence of a 6 Lira and below per pack segment.","This was partly offset by our successful launch of Chesterfield at 6 Lira. The brand achieved a 1.2% market share in August, just three months after its introduction.","Finally Asia, where I will start with the Philippines. Tax-paid industry volume in the third quarter declined at a rate of 6.7% to 23 billion units and this in line with the second-quarter trend and a significant improvement over the first quarter decline rate of nearly 40%.","However, Nielsen consumer uptake adult smoking incidence and adult daily consumption data indicate that cigarette consumption is essentially stable while down-trading has been significant. The difference can be explained by the huge under-declaration by our main local competitor. While it increases its tax declared volume from an average of 500 million units per month in the first quarter to 1.1 billion units in the second quarter and 1.4 billion units in August, we estimate that this represented less than half of the volume it showed during this period.","The retail price of its main brand Mighty has remained as one peso per cigarette. This is an economically unsustainable level when paying full taxes. We continue to work with the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Customs in our government authorities to address this issue. During the third quarter, we started to reduce our pricing support behind fortune and especially our lowest price brand. As a result, our monthly volume declined and our share of the tax paid market drop from 82.5% in the second quarter to 77.2% in the third quarter. We will continue to statistically balance the volume and profitability equation, but until the authorities address the issue decisively, the Philippines will remain a significant challenge. ","Let me now turn to Japan where cigarette industry volume was down by just over 1% in the third quarter and remains on track to decline by about 2% for the full year. We have Tokyo objectives in Japan to reinforce our leadership in the growing menthol segment and to improve our performance in the larger non-menthol segment. To address the latter, we launch a new smoother tasting Marlboro (inaudible) September.","This was to widen the feel of the brand to mainstream non-menthol adult smokers and improve Marlboro\u2019s relatively small 6.2% share of this segment. We still accounted for 73.7% of the total market (inaudible) September. Our market share decreased by one point in the third quarter to 26.5% reflecting the impact of competitor\u2019s launches in the second quarter on Marlboro\u2019s menthol segment share and continued our switching from the more traditional (inaudible) and Philip Morris non-menthol volume. Marlboro\u2019s market share of 12.2% was however in line with the previous quarter held by the launch of Marlboro clear.","This new (inaudible) strengthened our pipeline of consumer relevant innovative offers should enable us to gradually stabilize our market share in Japan. Our optimizes is backed by the gradual reduction in the quarter-to-quarter share decline during the year and positive preliminary adult consumer update data for September. Earlier this month, the Japanese government confirmed its intentions to raise the consumption tax from 5% to 8% in next April. The percent for Marlboro would be about \u00a514 per pack. But keep in mind that any price increase in Japan requires approval from the Ministry of Finance.","Let me now turn to Indonesia where the economic slowdown and the increase in the cost of basic foods and fuel impacted the cigarette industry which grew by just 0.03% during the third quarter. As a result, we are now expecting full year industry volume growth to be about 2%. The pressure on consumer purchasing power has be most acute around the lower income strata resulting in 7.6% quarterly decline in cigarette volume in the low price segment while the premium at this price segments were PMI index grew by 3.5% and 1.4% respectively.","This development (inaudible) growing adult consumer preference for machine (inaudible) has enabled us to continue to grow share. Sampoerna A and U Mild gained 0.6 points and 0.9 points respectively in the quarter. In addition, Marlboro has strong momentum. It gained 0.5 point to reach a quarterly share of 5.4%. Meanwhile (inaudible) has lost share since it became the first major brand to move about the (inaudible) price point ahead of competitive brands. We have continued to increase prices on a regular basis and it has now fully offset the impact of the January export tax increase as well as higher clove cost.","Effective October 1, the government enacted an amended regulation that addresses the loophole whereby large manufacturers could spread their production volume across sister companies and benefit from lower excise tax rates. This will affect around 2% of our volume, while the impact will be much more significant for several of our competitors.","We await the government\u2019s decision as to whether the regular annual excise tax increase will be eliminated in 2014 or at least moderated to take into account the anticipated imposition of a new regional tax of 10%.","Let me also say a few words about the exciting business development projects that we have recently completed. The purchase of the remaining 20% interest in our Mexican affiliate for $703 million closed in the third quarter.","This is a profitable 34 billion unit cigarette market, in which we achieved a 72.8% market share through September this year. Marlboro had a 51.7% share over the same period, one of the highest in the world. The acquisition is projected to be marginally accretive as of the fourth quarter this year.","The second deal that closed during the third quarter was the acquisition of a 49% stake in Arab Investors-TA for $625 million. Algeria is a profitable $30 billion unit cigarette market, in which we achieved an estimated 40% share this year through September, driven by Marlboro. This investment significantly enhances our prospects in this important North African market.","The agreement also opens the door to additional business opportunities in certain other North African and Middle Eastern markets, such as Egypt. The acquisition is projected to be accretive as of 2014.","Our free cash flow was up by 45.5%, excluding currency, in the third quarter due mainly to a reduction in working capital and higher net earnings. In September this year, our Board approved a 10.6% increase in our quarterly dividend, which now stands at $3.76 per share on an annualized basis. It has more than doubled since the $1.84 rate at the time of the spin. Our target dividend payout ratio remains 65%. This reflects our strong confidence in our business fundamentals and future prospects. Our dividend yield is currently around 4.4%.","We spent a further $1.5 billion on share repurchases in the third quarter and expect a similar level of expenditures in the fourth quarter. By year end, we will have spent about half of the $18 billion three-year program that was authorized by the Board in August 2012.","Since the spin through this September, we have repurchased 539 million shares, representing approximately 26% of our shares outstanding at that time at an average price of $60.02 per share. During this time, we have been able to sustain our very solid balance sheet and remain committed to maintaining our single-A credit rating.","In conclusion, our business fundamentals are solid and our commitment to reward our shareholders remains steadfast. Despite persistently difficult macroeconomic conditions, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and we anticipate a strong fourth quarter. We have updated our guidance to reflect prevailing exchange rates and the fourth quarter restructuring charge, as well as a cautious outlook regarding certain markets.","Our 2013 reported diluted EPS guidance is $5.35 to $5.40 and represents a full year growth rate of approximately 10%, excluding currency and charges, compared to our 2012 adjusted diluted EPS of $5.22.","Thank you. I will now be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","So, Jacek, I guess first question is, is just looking at the Asia region and I think at the corporate level the pricing variance was very strong, but within Asia, I think, sequentially the pricing variance actually decelerated. So, I\u2019m wondering if you can just give us some perspective of how much pricing you've taken in Indonesia, what was the timing of that and then how much of that was offset by the Philippines lowering other price and how we should think about that in the fourth the quarter? Is this something that we'll continue to drive down to fourth quarter or is it the timing of the Indonesia pricing such that pricing actually accelerates in the fourth quarter and does that help your margins in Asia?","Jacek Olczak","It might just (inaudible) could give you some color. I mean, Asia, if I exclude Philippines, Asia margin for the quarter essentially would be flat so the Philippines is driving the margin performance in Asia in the quarter. Pricing wise, I mean, Indonesia is going as per planned, as you know we have a regular pretty often I should say as the price increases there. And as we said on the second quarter call around this time of the year, we should offset the pressure from offset the impact excise tax and clock prices. ","So Indonesia now is in a positive territory when it comes to margin improved that should remain like this for the remaining fourth quarter. One thing which we have to remember which we don't have in Asia is that lack of pricing in Japan, right. So that is something which just appears from time to time. ","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. And then just following up in Indonesia can you just give us your thoughts on the likelihood of the new website tax going in Indonesia next year and then just in light of the magnitude of the potential excise tax can increase if all of that goes through next year, how you are thinking about kind of the volume outlook as we go into 2014 and your ability to pats on the pricing in Indonesia. ","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean, pricing Indonesia remain strong for this and in the previous year, so despite the tax increases and also the price on the input cost, but I mean, I don't see today anything on a horizon which were to put that question mark on our ability to price in Indonesia. So pricing remains strong in Indonesia. What we know at this stage is that there will be local tax of 10% increase to the current rate under the question is our national government will like to put something on the top of that and (inaudible). I think at this stage, I think it's more of a speculation. I'm we'll know for sure what is the tax for Indonesia by the end of November, that is on a pricing in Indonesia.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","I mean, last question (inaudible) just looking at the volume decline obviously in EEMA and Ukraine, first just in terms of the outlook for those market, you've kind of given the rest of this year, but is this illicit trade situation really a problem that you think will continue to impact as we get into 2014 and then I think there are some charter about the government potential looking at reversing excise tax increases or were there plans to reverse the excise tax increases, unless we are given the illicit trade ramp up, so I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts on that prospect?","Jacek Olczak","Hi (inaudible) there is more of these show really situated in Ukraine than in Russia. In Russia, we started of serving some incidents, I think of about 3% as of second quarter in Russia. I think it stays about the level that actually is better reason for Prime Minister being interviewed in which we think that might be the issue to looking to the tax rate, growth of the tax rate in the three year plan. For a time being, what we know is that the tax will be the specific component and a little bit of that will go up in January next year; this will create a pass on or for the pass on the (inaudible). And then if you follow the three year plan, the remaining three year the platform should be 5 and 8, so 5 in 2015 and 8 in 2016.","So for me it might be pretty much a speculation today, but I think they are more refers to the tax increase in the last year of the three year plan and on the third year of the plan. We are also watching, I think it's a very welcome by art, I mean, Russian government started watching how their prices is compared to the surrounding conflicts, which we know also plays the factor in any incentive, if you like really sits straight. So now as long as a Russian government on alert and they try to think proactively, I mean we very much welcome this development.","Judy Hong - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Hi, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Hi David.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Couple of questions. First of all, Jacek, what\u2019s the prospect that in trying to manage the business in what\u2019s clearly a difficult macro and difficult volume environment that you feel that in retrospect, six months from now, nine months from now, that you haven\u2019t done sufficient -- either sufficient marketing in certain of the markets or that maybe that you in retrospect will push pricing a bit too hard?","Jacek Olczak","No. My spent behind the brands is, I mean, for the total year, my spent will be above the last year\u2019s level. I mean, we -- I know that we have some comps -- various competitions this year, I mean, quarters-on-quarters, but over -- for the full year, we will actually invest more than the last year. And as you will see also from our brand portfolio perspective, I mean if the brands wouldn\u2019t grow market share we would -- if they would be lacking any investment.","So I think we are doing right job is the deployment in the commercial organization, the number of innovations which we are bringing behind the Marlboro and all other brands, I think that -- the brand portfolio in terms of the equity, the help of the brands I think might be a strongest year we ever had since the spin of how the portfolio performs.","Now you mentioned the macros which we had, there are macros in a country. They are not macros on a global basis. So we need to start looking into this a little bit more selectively because, yes, there was a bit of acceleration in Russia for the wrong reasons. Yes, we have a big challenge in -- major challenge in Philippines, but we also have a markets frankly speaking where the total industrial volumes are growing and there is uptrading. So I would be very careful, how we talk about the thing, the macro does not necessarily mean global.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Second question, Jacek, presumably your budgeting is not done for next year, you don\u2019t know all of the excise tax increases that you would necessarily face and I am not asking for a specific prediction? But broadly speaking what\u2019s your confidence level today looking out to next year that the company can deliver financial results that are consistent with the mid-to long-term plans that you have?","Jacek Olczak","Well, it is pretty challenging this year as many have noticed and we still have, in our guidance today, we said that we are going to deliver approximate 10% growth. So and we have the number. We had a number of challenges this year. Some of them may fade out, some of this may continue next year.","I think, when I feel strong, when I feel confident is, the number of quarters which we demonstrated the dollar brands are very strong, including Marlboro despite the adverse microeconomic in some countries, especially European Union.","Pricing power, I mean, you have seen our pricing power for the first three quarters of this year is $1.5 billion, I mean, that is very strong and that remains and I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon, which could challenge this one. I think a tax structure is applying into our hand and frankly speaking, at this stage we are not aware, we don\u2019t feel that there was any attempt to have a disruptive tax increase in the near future.","So, there are a number of factors which plays into our hand. Total markets are priced driven by various factors in some geographies may continue through the 2014. I mean this we\u2019ll have to see.","I mean you notice that EU is getting sequentially better and better, but I don\u2019t see under like data which would give me more opportunities. I am referring to unemployment, because employment is spread like pancakes since January this year, although the industry volumes development is encouraged. But, I think, I need another quarter or so, and then we will be more confident to say more firmly how do we expect our performance for \u201814 and beyond.","David Adelman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Citi.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Hi. Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Vivien.","Vivien Azer - Citi","I wanted to touch on price elasticities globally given some of the buy downs that you have seen across some of your major market and Indonesia really comes to mind. I am curious, I appreciate that inflation is becoming a bigger and bigger issue, but have you noticed the deterioration in your price elasticity as well?","Jacek Olczak","No. I think on a global basis, where the elasticities are between minus 0.3 to minus 0.5. This is -- and in some countries you will see the higher elasticities but they are driven by the fact that the consumers disposable income is on the negative side, right. So in the real terms, our price increases may trigger the higher elasticity. I think Italy, Spain and a couple of the Southern European countries, they presume (inaudible) in a heightened elasticity levels just because there was an erosion on the disposable income. Indonesia, as you referred to, I don\u2019t think we have the (inaudible) would be fairly in the range which I gave at the beginning.","Vivien Azer - Citi","So for Indonesia, I mean it\u2019s the third guide down in terms of your outlook for volume growth in that market in roughly four months. So in your mind then it\u2019s strictly that inflation has just gotten that much worse that quickly?","Jacek Olczak","(Inaudible) have a different (inaudible) inflation and the food inflation and I think the food inflation impacts more in relative terms, some of the consumer growth, therefore, we see the volumes in the lower part of the market actually declining and the volumes in the premium segment going up to make the total market growing. I think you will have a different elasticity defined on the -- again on a disposable income of consumer. I think the underlying grade for Indonesia, the growth rate for Indonesia for the summer December in the range of \u2026 maybe about 2%. I mean this (inaudible) from the demographic and some positive GDP per capital -- develop.","Vivien Azer - Citi","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel Nicolaus.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Hi, good morning Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Good morning. So I just have a couple of questions for you. I wonder as first of all to Philippines, it sounds like there has been some sequential improvement in tax collection there. You gave some number on that which is great. And so if you have any color on that and basically what's going on in the market? My following question for that would be the tax increase goes -- there\u2019s a tax increase in the Philippines next year as well. It\u2019s more heavily focused on the low end. If they\u2019re going to see something like that to help move those low end prices up, was there enough that government can do in this (inaudible) to get more tax collection among these low price brands?","Jacek Olczak","","Yes. That\u2019s true that there was an increase in sequential tax collection. But you know the vision in Philippines is not about the colleting more taxes, but collecting the right amount of taxes. If somebody is paying more, but they\u2019re still under declaring, frankly speaking of a little hedge, so the same sort of a tax evasion or cheating or whatever is the appropriate word for the situation. Now there is a tax increase next year. I think partially also why we are now moving with the prices up is to (inaudible) in the lower prices at the bottom of the market and waiting for the government to take the actions there, the government was immune by the fact that I was paying the taxes on a lower price portfolio. One of my competitors was not paying.","So I think partially as going with the prices, they\u2019re bringing the government into the play because somebody is going to also suffer by not collecting the taxes. So we see how those (inaudible). I mean Philippines remains challenging. But situations might change in Philippines. The government is really decisive and its Law Enforcement Act, enforcement authorities are decisive. They can fix the problem in a month. But we have to wait for this month.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. And I had just one more question for you, just sort of a broad question. You had a set of investments in several key markets that started last year. You\u2019ve now wrapped a lot of those investments. I guess as we see softer volumes, is that indication that the investments weren\u2019t enough that you need to invest some more? I\u2019m just trying to look ahead and think about what you can do to help spend some of the declines in volume, is it something you can do from an investment standpoint more about the total market decline?","Jacek Olczak","No, I see the softening of my market share as the market shares decline. I think it would be an indicator for me that I am underinvested with regards to that support. My investment, marketing sales investment et cetera, I mean in cannot mitigate the impact of the total market decline especially that in some countries I am competing with illicit products. I mean that\u2019s not a function of the marketing investment (inaudible). As I said with the earlier question, this year we\u2019re going to spend more than last year (inaudible) in the quarters. But the market share advancement of all of our brands, most of our brands including Marlboro in a number of the geographies, I mean it\u2019s the best testimony that we\u2019re doing the right thing and we\u2019re supporting the brands in the right way.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","","Okay, thank you for your answer Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog with Wells Fargo.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Good morning.","Jacek Olczak","Hi, Bonnie.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","I guess I\u2019m still trying to understand how realistic your 10% EPS guidance is, given what this implies for volume growth in Q4. In other words, I think your volume growth needs to be positive in the quarter with pretty strong pricing to get close to your revised 10% EPS guidance. So how realistic is that for you to generate positive volume growth and then, I guess what gives you the confidence that this is achievable?","Jacek Olczak","Well, my total volume outlook for this year -- the total PMI\u2019s volume outlook for this year is about in a range which we will have now for the nine months. So I think it is about 3%, ex-Philipines there is about our volume outlook. Pricing will continue as you\u2019ll see quarter after quarter, we\u2019re delivering strong pricing.","There were some prices which were into some places, we\u2019ll implement the pricing in the third quarter. So that will have a full benefit in the forth quarter plus as we said that the earlier -- at the Q2 call, we\u2019ll have some better comps on the cost side. So I feel very confident that we will deliver the forth quarter.","Although we\u2019re fully aware that the fourth quarter growth rate will be significantly higher than what we had demonstrated in the third quarter. But this is all going as per plan as you remember I have started from the beginning of the year was that we\u2019ll have a low start over the year and in the second part of the year, third and the forth quarter, this is where we expect to deliver the growth of this whole year.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","So everything\u2019s falling in mind relative to your expectation?","Jacek Olczak","Yes.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. And I guess just my final question, I think is, the EU Directive decided not to ban e-cigs as medicine. So I\u2019m curious, how does this change your thinking on the category and your timing for entering, if at all?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean, we -- you know about our plan, right that we said that we are working on three platforms and we\u2019ve showed that we aim to 216, 217 for this whole commercialization. I think we stay on track with this one. I mean the directive -- what we\u2019re missing in the directive is a little bit more time spend -- just later and trying to figure out what the frame work legislation should be for us meeting new product being e-cigarettes or others, new generation products that modified to risk tobacco product into the market.","The lot of focus was to spend on some other elements which I don\u2019t think addressing really public health council which directive was suppose to authorize that the whole novel product territories are not fully addressed. But, yes, I mean if a good development that the e-cigarettes will be in the tobacco product directive rather than under the farmer\u2019s legislation, we will see.","Also the other reasons I can\u2019t talk where we would enter the market and how we could accelerate our entrance to the market, but we are very excited about this category working on our plan on -- we\u2019re making a progress in accordance with the critical part delivering the clinical status. We are searching the consumers and organizing our -- building our capacity to be on time of -- everything goes okay maybe ahead of time with the products in the market.","Bonnie Herzog - Wells Fargo","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Morning gentlemen. I\u2019ve got a few questions actually. According to me, the market volume guidance was 2% for the full year seems to imply as to 3% to 4% in the last quarter, I mean, is there any reasons, the industry volume should improve quite rapidly in the forth quarter after relatively weak third quarter?","And secondly, the Italy was quite a major -- market volumes down 4% in the third quarter. So quite a significant improvement than what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Is there some particular fact behind that and do you expect that to be sustained with recent sort of that increases. Is that -- is that likely to deteriorate again?","Jacek Olczak","Okay. I may start with Italy. I may Italy -- yes it has had some improvements in the decline rate of the total industry volumes. I think what we have said also in Italy is a little bit of less of illicit product and I think it also partially might have contributed to the better results in the quarter. We will have to see what -- how that thing, how the lower incident of illicit product versus the beginning of the year, as you remember, I think they had spike to 11%. This lower illicit incidents, I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s going to stay. So that may support the volumes. I mean as the VAT increase, I mean, it's an average sort of government trying to impose some extra taxes and are hoping for the better consumption. So that's a little bit not very welcome, but let's see how does it unfolds in Italy. ","In Indonesia, I think there are some seasonality also behind the quarters and I think this is what drive us to believe that we will have a Indonesia will deliver on above the 2% for the full year and are little bit calls for the better or stronger volume performance in the fourth quarter of this year.","Jon Leinster - UBS","Thank. Then, we just going back to the Philippines, you are low with prices; I'm just going to get the timeline right. So you are low with prices in Q2 and then what that's appeared in Q3, did you actually sort of increased them again?","Jacek Olczak","We lowered prices, actually we start lowering the prices at the end of Q1. We were in full fledge in the Q2 and I think towards the end of the Q3, we started moving the prices up.","Jon Leinster - UBS","So certainly in the end of Q3 you started raising them. So in spite with the price reductions really didn't help at all in terms of market share. ","Jacek Olczak","There was a down trading. ","Jon Leinster - UBS","Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede with Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","I saw that German course have spent the use of it (inaudible) campaign in Germany, how does it impact your business?","Jacek Olczak","They've banned some execution aspect of that campaign. But now considering you know that's available to our (inaudible) it's how we're going to go forward because we are pretty confident that we have not violated in local legislation. I don't think -- you know that the other forms of the market going to support to brand which we can continue delivering there because they are just questioning some aspect of that campaign. So I don't think we'll have a -- we should have any negative input of a suspension of this executional element of this company.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Any concerns that other European cords will pick the same line of argument?","Jacek Olczak","Well, I mean, Germany is one of the few if not the only one country in the year which still allows you to bill board right, so they were questioning the bill board and so I think (inaudible) commercial in was with the other European countries the campaign is being delivered to consumers more for the one to one and other means. So no I don't think have any repercussion in the remaining European countries.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","And then I've also seen reports out of Australia, the convenience stores are now reporting an increase in illicit trade after the standard packaging and all that went into effect at the beginning of the year, are you seeing the same thing?","Jacek Olczak","We are seeing the same thing. I don't have the hard data, but the early information which we received from our obsolete in Australia indicates that there was about illicit traded about doubled versus what it used to be before the implementation of (inaudible) on illicit trade, but I'm not extremely surprised by this, because we taught that the play impact may facilitate the illicit trade and fortunately this is happening.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Do you think that the fact that, the data is now starting to come out and make the legal challenge easier?","Jacek Olczak","Well, sorry the data will -- I think on the illicit trade will come out soon, once it's started out to confirm. I mean, this speculation -- I mean we've -- when it comes to our claim under the VAT, VAT in Hong Kong, I mean, that we are progressing there as per the calendar, but yes I mean, there is enough element which we have been raising with the government before the playing packaging is not addressing consumption frankly speaking, it will not get the total volume developments in Australia. You don't see any declines in total volumes as you have the appear of the, heightened appearance of illicit trade and I think also you might say that you see some acceleration in the down trading. This is all as we were saying this will be the impact of a playing packing. ","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Okay. Thanks. (Inaudible)","Jacek Olczak","Okay","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Hello. Just back on the Indonesia for a second. Obviously the inflationary pressures are some of what\u2019s slowing category growth, but it also was the easiest comp of the year in the third quarter? What did it look like sequentially, was there improvement coming out of the quarter, I guess I want to understand a little better where the strength would come in 4Q, because that was one of the toughest comps last year as well?","Jacek Olczak","Well, usually, I think, the first quarter in the Asia was the strong quarter, that is what I was referring that there is some seasonality impact et cetera which you have in Indonesia. So, therefore, yes, we expect the stronger quarter this year.","As I said earlier, I don\u2019t think that the growth rate of the industry in the third quarter is underlying growth rate of the industry, right. I think the underlying growth rate is a closer to 2%, about 2%]. So, yes, you will have the fluctuations between a quarter.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","No. I understand that, I guess, but the two things I am trying to get out is, if there\u2019s seasonality, but it\u2019s -- a stronger growth rate in the fourth quarter, does that give more and more exaggerated every year?","And then just back to the third quarter, can -- do you have any visibility on what the progression was throughout the quarter, was it same down in July and then flat in August, and up whatever percent in September that you can see the consumers adjusting to the inflation pressure that some of that momentum should continue into 4Q?","Jacek Olczak","Well, consumer are adjusting to that inflation pressures, I would just say earlier, I mean, you have a different rate, sorry, different impact by consumer income classes, okay. So if you have a second, I think it was second spike in a food inflation this year, one was at the beginning of the year, one was in the third quarter, well this has an impact on the consumption levels in the lower price classes, presumably more on the daily consumptions of smoking incidence, but this is what we have serve. So there will be adjustments in this -- in the consumer pattern. So that\u2019s of -- that is on the volume side, this will happen.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. And then just on Japan for a moment, you reminded us that the Ministry of Finance needs to approve the price increases, which is of course true? Are you worried about getting that approve at all or you -- was that just stating that term kind of highlight the procedures involved?","Jacek Olczak","The role in Japan that if you want to change the prices, you have to seek the approval of the Minister of Finance, so that\u2019s going to stay, also some Prime Minister and others have publicly, I think, before when the discussion was about the sales tax that talking about the fact that it wouldn\u2019t like necessary to spike inflations while having the sales tax increase. So we will have to see. We have not filed for the tax -- for the, excuse me, for the price registration in Japan and there is still a time before the sales tax is implemented.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. Thanks. And then, I just want to make sure I have one clarification earlier in the call but as you said you expect profitability improvement in 4Q, was that versus 3Q '13 or versus 4Q \u201912?","Jacek Olczak","I was referring to the growth rate of the EPS ex-currency in the fourth quarter over fourth quarter.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. And then just lastly following upon e-cigarettes, I understand you have your next-generation products that you\u2019re developing and the EU TPD doesn\u2019t really directly involve I think I don\u2019t believe? But just in terms of e-cigarettes and then having what\u2019s impact maybe little bit more of a Regulatory Green Light? At what point do you consider that a threat enough if those keep growing that you would want maybe getting involved in something on earlier timeline than your NPGs with, something like in e-cigarette, is there a launch you would consider, obviously you\u2019ve got the U.S. market where the big three are getting involved and Lorillard is coming to the U.K.? Do you think that\u2019s a place that you want to play or you intend to just wait for the next-generation products that you have coming?","Jacek Olczak","I\u2019d said we are very closely watching the developments in the category. I think between the reasons why we said earlier that we\u2019re working on the three platforms and one of the platform is essentially in the territory of e-cigarette, is that we believe there will be a reason there will be a market for all three platforms. Now the question still remains and if you look at the performance of e-cigarette category, a lot of attention is more on the marketing side side and to our knowledge, that the tension is on the product side. I think what is extremely important is in our (inaudible) strategy is to get to the product right. So I don\u2019t think -- I\u2019ve said it on a number of occasions, it\u2019s not that you need to be first to the market, you need to go to the market with the right product.","Michael Lavery - CLSA","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.","Erik Bloomquist - Berenberg Bank","Hello. I was hoping you could comment on Russia in particular and why the premium shipment volume was down so severely in the third quarter (inaudible) were down 17%. That seems a bit odd with what's been relatively stable to rising trend for the mid to higher price segments. So I was wondering if something had been going on there that would explain that as an aberration or is that something that we should be considering as something that could have some continuing effects?","Jacek Olczak","The difference between our shipments to the distributor versus what is happening in the market, so the companies would (inaudible) these issues. Now if you look at the total market size in Russia maybe to give you a more color on this one, I mean the market was down about 7.9% if I remember correctly, for the quarter. If you look at the composition of the decline about, up to 17% of the decline came from the low price segment, but the value went about -- the value (inaudible) in a premium segment, they declined by a little bit by less than 3.5%. That\u2019s 3.3%. So you could see that, the (inaudible) segments in Russia are doing relatively well. This price impacted the (inaudible) price increases and the lower segments have the more ease under more pressure.","But again I think it has been the same explanation to the use for Indonesia. I mean a different consumer growth that impacted differently by the price increases.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","Hey, good morning, Jacek.","Jacek Olczak","Good morning.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","I just had a question regarding Japan in terms of the pricing that you would consider taking; have you thought about I guess which brand may get which level of pricing? I think you mentioned that it\u2019s \u00a514 per pack. But I think you want to probably increase it in \u00a510 increments. How much -- is there a focus on maybe your price gaps versus (inaudible) and which brands will get what level of pricing?","Jacek Olczak","(Inaudible) we have decided our pricing strategy and I think it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate for me to comment further on this at this time.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","Okay. And then just regarding the illicit trade that you\u2019re seeing in certain countries like -- Turkey you said, it\u2019s still pretty bad, maybe you\u2019ve got a little better sequentially. Ukraine and Russia are still also pretty bad. Does it have to get worse maybe before the government really steps in there and it actually starts to get better?","Jacek Olczak","","No, actually I mentioned earlier (inaudible) referring also to some incidents, higher incidents of illicit product, tobacco illicit products and I think alcohol and that the government is considering now the option how to tackle the problem at the early stages is very welcomed. I wish many other governments would act so promptly when the problem is small rather than let the problem to grow to the almost, in some places difficult to manage the levels.","Ukraine is a little bit of a different story. Ukraine is also the story of the counterfeit products, not only illicit product. So every country has its own sort of the background in that. Turkey, sequential there was a slight improvement. We know from the part of the Turkish government, was highly very decisive and acted very promptly to address the issue which they can repeat more of the same. So let\u2019s wait.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","Okay, thanks for that and just my last question. Is it possible to get some insight in terms of what the FX impact would be overflowing to fiscal \u201914? I think you\u2019re (inaudible) some yen hedges as well as, can you give me -- give us some magnitude of what you see in fiscal \u201914?","Jacek Olczak","","Some of this -- everything depends on what's going to happen with the U.S. dollar. So that\u2019s -- lot of surprises also coming from the U.S. side. I think yen may stay. Remember that we have hedged quite a portion of the yen exposure for this year early -- earlier. So I mean some of the pressure from a yen for us in terms of effective exchange rates, it will may continue to next year, depend where the yen is going to look.","Our issue is when we will revise the forecast now -- guidance now is essentially not because of yen is very much because of developing currency -- developing countries currencies. So I think Indonesian rupiah was the biggest driver of our revised currency guidance -- variance guidance.","Ryan Oksenhendler - Bank of America","All right, guys. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of David Hayes with Nomura.","David Hayes - Nomura","All right, gentlemen. Hi. Just in terms of coming back to the underlying EPS cuts since the second quarter. You\u2019ve obviously called out Russia is little bit worse since then, Indonesia as well, Turkey looks a little bit better, EU about the same. I just wonder whether there is anything else outside of those markets, it was driving that slightly low underlying EPS outlook that we haven\u2019t spoken out.","And then I guess related to that in terms of the Russian side of things. You mentioned in the second quarter stage despite the volumes down more than you expected, you still saw profitability, you said explicitly the profitability will be up year-on-year, on the slide it wasn\u2019t there this time. I just wonder you can confirm that you still see profitability in Russia itself being up for the full year? Thanks very much.","Jacek Olczak","Yeah. Yeah. I mean we see the profitability in Russia being very strong year-on-year as we demonstrated in this quarter. In terms of the countries or the market reach, we referring now at the guidance. I think, yeah, it\u2019s Philippines which is on the list. In the Japan share of market since we had, okay, sequentially, we\u2019re still seeing stabilization in Japan, but yeah we lost that one share point, one full share point on a quarter.","The Indonesia total market is softer in terms of the growth rate that we initially thought for the full year, so we\u2019ll have to acknowledge that one. That\u2019s about it. I think the main drivers.","David Hayes - Nomura","Okay. Thank you.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Chris Burritt with Bloomberg News.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Thank you for taking my questions, Jacek. First, I wanted to ask about\u2026","Jacek Olczak","My pleasure.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","\u2026 in light of your recent success in Thailand and postponing the placement of those big health warnings on packages. What\u2019s your -- what\u2019s PM\u2019s outlook for regulatory efforts in emerging markets? Which markets do you see your biggest threats on that front?","Jacek Olczak","Frankly speaking, it is not much that we cover more news on the regulatory front because, yes, I mean, the TPD, the regulatory developments which we\u2019ll have to wait, there\u2019s still a few months until we see what is the final conclusion on this one. And yes, I mean here and there you might have some regulatory initiatives but nothing actually on the horizon which would not allow me to sleep at this stage.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Okay. And if I may ask one last quick question, a bit of an oddball, given the rise in the popularity of electronic cigarettes hear in the U.S., what\u2019s the policy for PM in terms of employees in your New York office consuming e-cigs. Is that always been allowed to something you\u2019re allowing now given the popularity, what are you guys doing with that?","Jacek Olczak","Well, our New York office is a non-smoking office. This is for the convention of cigarettes. I know myself that presumably you will see me on number of occasions and I\u2019m smoking my NGP. I think we would have to -- it's much more to that element of how disturbing you\u2019re actually for others around you. It\u2019s more of the matter of a heart disease than defining in the policy.","Chris Burritt - Bloomberg News","Thanks for your time. I appreciate it.","Jacek Olczak","Thank you.","Operator","That was our final question. Now, I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Nick Rolli for any closing remarks.","Nick Rolli","Thank you very much. That concludes our call for today. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the investor relations team here in Switzerland. Again thank you for joining us and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."]}}
